                "MOST ANTICIPATED READS OF 2023: ELLE   The Millions   Essence / BEST SUMMER READS OF 2023: New York Times Book Review   USA Today   The Skimm   Bookpage   St Louis Post-Dispatch    \"Aisha Harris is one of our smartest, most entertaining modern cultural critics. The nine pieces offer insight on Stevie Wonder, the Spice Girls, Pen15, and New Girl\u2014among many other pop artifacts, of course\u2014which might as well be parlance for, 'Read me immediately.'\"     \u2014ELLE   Aisha Harris has made a name for herself as someone you can turn to   for a razor-sharp take on whatever show or movie everyone   is talking about. Now, she turns her talents inward, mining the benchmarks of her nineties childhood and beyond to analyze the tropes that are shaping all of us, and our ability to shape them right back.  In the opening essay, an interaction with Chance the Rapper prompts an investigation into the origin myth of her name. Elsewhere, Aisha traces the evolution of the \"Black Friend\" trope from its Twainian origins through to the heyday of the Spice Girls, teen comedies like Clueless, and sitcoms of the New Girl variety. And she examines the overlap of taste and identity in this era, rejecting the patriarchal ethos that you are what you like .  Whatever the subject, sitting down with her book feels like hanging out with your smart, hilarious, pop culture\u2013obsessed friend\u2014and it's a delight. "

                "A sharp-witted and deeply insightful look into the storied world of elite prep schools from the first African-American legacy student to graduate from The Taft School  Early on in Kendra James's professional life, she began to feel like she was selling a lie. As an admissions officer specializing in diversity recruitment for independent prep schools, she persuaded students and families to embark on the same perilous journey she herself had made\u2014to attend cutthroat and largely white schools similar to The Taft School, where she had been the first African-American legacy student only a few years earlier. Her new job forced her to reflect on her own elite education experience and to realize how disillusioned she had become with America's inequitable system.  In Admissions, James looks back at the three years she spent at Taft, chronicling clashes with her white roommate, how she had to unlearn the respectability politics she had been raised with, and the fall-out from a horrifying article in the student newspaper that accused Black and Latinx students of being responsible for segregation of campus. Through these stories, some troubling, others hilarious, she deconstructs the lies and half-truths she herself would later tell as an admissions professional, in addition to the myths about boarding schools perpetuated by popular culture.  With its combination of incisive social critique and uproarious depictions of elite nonsense, Admissions will resonate with anyone who has ever been \"the only one\" in a room, dealt with racial microaggressions, or even just suffered from an extreme case of homesickness.

                "As a 6'2\" dreadlocked black man, Tyler Merritt knows what it feels like to be stereotyped as threatening, which can have dangerous consequences. But he also knows that proximity to people who are different from ourselves can be a cure for racism.  Tyler Merritt's video \"Before You Call the Cops\" has been viewed millions of times. He's appeared on  Jimmy Kimmel  and  Sports Illustrated  and has been profiled in the  New York Times . The viral video's main point\u2014the more you know someone, the more empathy, understanding, and compassion you have for that person\u2014is the springboard for this book. By sharing his highs and exposing his lows, Tyler welcomes us into his world in order to help bridge the divides that seem to grow wider every day.In  I Take My Coffee Black,  Tyler tells hilarious stories from his own life as a black man in America. He talks about growing up in a multi-cultural community and realizing that he wasn't always welcome, how he quit sports for musical theater (that's where the girls were) to how Jesus barged in uninvited and changed his life forever (it all started with a Triple F.A.T. Goose jacket) to how he ended up at a small Bible college in Santa Cruz because he thought they had a great theater program (they didn't). Throughout his stories, he also seamlessly weaves in lessons about privilege, the legacy of lynching and sharecropping and why you don't cross black mamas. He teaches readers about the history of encoded racism that still undergirds our society today.By turns witty, insightful, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny,  I Take My Coffee Black  paints a portrait of black manhood in America and enlightens, illuminates, and entertains\u2014ultimately building the kind of empathy that might just be the antidote against the racial injustice in our society.

But when Issa Rae, the creator of the Shorty Award&#8211;winning hit series \"The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,\" is that introvert&#8212;whether she's navigating love, work, friendships, or \"rapping\"&#8212;it sure is entertaining. Now, in this debut collection of essays written in her witty and self-deprecating voice, Rae covers everything from cybersexing in the early days of the Internet to deflecting unsolicited comments on weight gain, from navigating the perils of eating out alone and public displays of affection to learning to accept yourself&#8212;natural hair and all. A reflection on her own unique experiences as a cyber pioneer yet universally appealing, The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl is a book no one&#8212;awkward or cool, black, white, or other&#8212;will want to miss.

'Part memoir and part masterclass in finding hope and joy in the face of unthinkable challenges. This isn't a book about cancer, it's a book about living'  \u2013 Jaquie Brown   Dai Henwood wanted to be a comedian even before he knew what a comedian was. He always knew there was something special in being able to make people laugh.  Over a 25-year career, the much-loved Kiwi entertainer and TV host has won every major comedy award in New Zealand. But in January 2023, Dai shared publicly that three years earlier he had been diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer.   Perhaps the ultimate teacher for what really matters, Dai's incurable cancer has shown him a new way of living that embraces small moments of perfection and cherishes things we often overlook.   As well as showing us how laughter can be a wonderful medicine \u2013 and there are many laughs in his book \u2013 Dai teaches us that often the gifts we've been searching for are right in front of us, if only we could see them.

Make some shit up, of course!\u00a0And a young Jay Ellis does just that, with help from his imaginary friend, Mikey. A testament to the importance of invention, trusting oneself, and making space for creativity,  Did Everyone Have an Imaginary Friend (or Just Me)?  is a memoir of a kid who confided in his imaginary sidekick to navigate parallel pop culture universes (like watching  Fresh Prince  alongside John Hughes movies or listening to Ja Rule and Dave Matthews) to a lifetime of birthday disappointment (being a Christmas-season Capricorn will do that to you) and hoop dreams gone bad. Mikey also guides Ellis through tragedies, like losing his teenage cousin in a mistaken-target drive-by and the shame and fear of being pulled over by cops almost a dozen times the year he got his driver\u2019s license. As his imaginary friend morphs into adult consciousness,\u00a0Ellis charts an unforgettable story of looking inward to solve to some of life\u2019s biggest (and smallest) challenges, told in the roast-you-with-love voice of your closest homey.

Is she talking fondly of dictators? Has she suddenly started quietly muttering in the Aldi queue about the \"Jewish Space Lasers\" she's heard are setting wildfires around the world to make sure everyone believes in climate change? When was the moment the world began to believe anything?  Danny Wallace, million-copy bestselling author of  Yes Man  and  Join Me , has fallen down the modern rabbit hole of lies, conspiracies and disinformation. Along the way, he encounters families torn apart by accusations and fake news, journalists putting themselves on the frontline of the disinformation war, reformed conspiracy theorists, influencers who see profit in stoking paranoia, and the shadowy nameless, faceless trolls on the other side of our screens. He discovers how disinformation and well-told lies can ruin a year or a whole life, how they can affect our family, our street, our community. How they can spread across a country, a continent, even the world. How they take hold of our imaginations and make us feel both helpless and powerful. And Danny asks: can you do anything to stop it \u2013 even with the truth on your side? \u00a92024 Danny Wallace (P)2024 Penguin Audio. "

                "From award-winning actor and comedian Paul Scheer, a candid and hilarious memoir-in-essays on coming to terms with childhood trauma and finding the joy in embracing your authentic self,   featuring content exclusive to the audio edition, including excerpts from live shows and audio clips from home movies.   Paul Scheer has entertained countless fans and podcast listeners with stories about the odd, wild, and absurd details of his life. Yet these tales have pointed to deeper, more difficult truths that the actor and comedian has kept to himself. Now, he is finally ready to share those truths for the first time\u2014but, of course, with a healthy dose of humor.  Blending the confident, affable voice that has won him a dedicated following with a refreshing level of candor, Joyful Recollections of Trauma chronicles Paul's often shocking, admittedly tumultuous childhood and how the experiences of his youth have reverberated throughout his life. In his comedy, Paul has always been unafraid to \"go there,\" to play na\u00efve, cringeworthy characters, imbuing them with disarming charm and humanity. That daring openness is on display in the pages of this memoir, but in true Paul fashion, it is also surprising, eye-opening, and side-splitting.  In this madcap journey through the inner working of his mind and creative process, Paul Scheer demonstrates once again that the truth is often stranger\u2014and funnier\u2014than fiction. Joyful Recollections of Trauma offers a unique perspective on universal themes: growing up, working through a challenging childhood, staying true to yourself, and finding success, fulfillment, and happiness in often strange and difficult circumstances. Throughout, Paul shares both the hard-fought lessons and the laughter that can be found in the darkest parts of life, and reminds us that what matters is not what you've been through but who you are becoming. If you loved recent memoirs by Molly Shannon, Maria Bamford, RuPaul, and Jennette McCurdy\u2014or any book that moves you to both laughter and tears\u2014Joyful Recollections of Trauma is the perfect read for you.

                "This program is read by the authors.  The true story of the greatest conspiracy in US history\u2014and how to fight back.   Have you ever seen a baby pigeon? You haven't, have you? No one has, not in many, many years. They used to be everywhere. You couldn't walk out of your front door in New York City in the 1930s without seeing dozens of those little guys scurrying around. Today, there are millions of grown up pigeons in New York, but not a baby pigeon to be seen. That's because they come out of the factory as adults. This is one of the many smoking guns of the bird drone surveillance crisis. Since 1959, the Deep State has mercilessly slaughtered over 12 billion birds and replaced them with identical drones that are designed to spy on private citizens and report their every action directly to the government. From pet canaries to  Sesame Street , the shadowy figures that pull the strings have infiltrated every aspect of our society, making a mockery of civil liberties while the American people live in blissful ignorance. Until now. In  Birds Aren't Real , whistleblowers Peter McIndoe and Connor Gaydos trace the roots of a political conspiracy so vast and well-hidden that it almost seems like an elaborate hoax. These hero Bird Truthers have risked life and limb to compile and disseminate a treasure trove of information about the origins of the surveillance crisis, its spread, and the patriots who are on the front lines today, raising awareness and working to reclaim America as the land of the free. This urgent manifesto features a host of useful illustrations, activities, and leaked classified documents that will convince even the most outspoken skeptic that birds aren't real. The truth is out there: will you stand and fight before it's too late?  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

But while it is true that there have never been so many primates on Earth, in reality, they are quite simple to teach using well-practiced domestication techniques, such as loud vocalizations, strategic nighttime alarms, and selective displays of affection.  And if you choose your specimen carefully, you'll find that it can be completely tamed, and you'll end up with the best, most faithful companion you could possibly wish for.

It's like he's crawling around inside your head opening file cabinets and telling you what the gibberish you've scribbled on each page in each file means. What a great, fun read.\"\"\u2014  Shea Serrano, #1 New York Times bestselling author    New York Times bestselling author Michael Arceneaux returns with a hilarious collection of essays about making your voice heard in an increasingly noisy and chaotic world.   In his books I Can't Date Jesus and I Don't Want to Die Poor, Michael Arceneaux established himself as one of the most beloved and entertaining writers of his generation, touching upon such hot-button topics as race, class, sexuality, labor, debt, and, of course, paying homage to the power and wisdom of Beyonc\u00e9. In this collection, Arceneaux takes stock of how far he has traveled\u2014and how much ground he still has to cover in this patriarchal, heteronormative society. He explores the opportunities afforded to Black creatives but also the doors that remain shut or ever-so-slightly ajar; the confounding challenges of dating in a time when social media has made everything both more accessible and more unreliable; and the allure of returning home while still pushing yourself to seek opportunity elsewhere.  I Finally Bought Some Jordans is both a corrective to, and a balm for, these troubling times, revealing a sharply funny and keen-eyed storyteller working at the height of his craft. "

                "A Most Anticipated Book of 2024: Elle, The Millions, LitHub, Nylon, BookPage, PureWow, and more    From the national bestselling novelist and essayist, a groundbreaking collection of brand-new pieces about the role of cultural criticism in our ever-changing world.   In her writing for Harper's, the London Review of Books, The New Yorker, and elsewhere, Lauren Oyler has emerged as one of the most trenchant and influential critics of her generation, a talent whose judgments on works of literature\u2014whether celebratory or scarily harsh\u2014have become notorious. But what is the significance of being a critic and consumer of media in today's fraught environment? How do we understand ourselves, and each other, as space between the individual and the world seems to get smaller and smaller, and our opinions on books and movies seem to represent something essential about our souls? And to put it bluntly, why should you care what she\u2014or anyone\u2014thinks?  In this, her first collection of essays, Oyler writes with about topics like the role of gossip in our exponentially communicative society, the rise and proliferation of autofiction, why we're all so \"vulnerable\" these days, and her own anxiety. In her singular prose\u2014sharp yet addictive, expansive yet personal\u2014she encapsulates the world we live and think in with precision and care, delivering a work of cultural criticism as only she can.  Bringing to mind the works of such iconic writers as Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, and Terry Castle, No Judgment is a testament to Lauren Oyler's inimitable wit and her quest to understand how we shape the world through culture. It is a sparkling nonfiction debut from one of today's most inventive thinkers. "

                "A humorous yet practical book of life lessons from the seminal  Little House on the Prairie , blending Laura Ingalls Wilder's timeless teachings with her surprisingly timely penchant for homesteading, crafting, and the lifestyle we now call Cottagecore.     The Little House on the Prairie  was a childhood TV classic for a generation of kids, and Laura Ingalls Wilder's novels have never gone out of style for young bookworms. Her stories of her family's life in the 1870s offer countless gems of wisdom, and many facets of their lifestyle and the skills they relied on have become some of the hottest trends of today, from sourdough bread and modern pioneering to DIY prairie dresses and needlepoint.    Little House Life Hacks  playfully compiles the most crucial takeaways from that world, practical enough to work for pioneering stock and updated for today's evolving world. The Ingalls are the perfect reminders of what's important: love, family, community, honest work, and integrity. Alongside the life advice are selected inspirational quotes from the  Little House  books and show and fun pop culture tidbits (like that The Rock's first celebrity crush was original mean girl Nellie Oleson), as well as with meaningful takeaways for creating more balance, wellness, and fun in all aspects of your life.

                "Throughout personal essays spiked with humor and natural science, archaeologist R. E. Burrillo widens his range beyond his popular Behind the Bears Ears. After an upstate New York childhood and a bartending stint in New Orleans's French Quarter, seasonal resort work led R. E. Burrillo to the desert Southwest, whose redrock landscapes were a source of stability through mental and physical illness. In The Backwoods of Everywhere, archaeologist Burrillo excavates his past, examining Indigenous and tourist cultures, the complexities of American archaeology, and what it means to be a local. From the ancient canal systems of Phoenix, Arizona, to the modern Mayan communities of the Yucatan Peninsula, to the depths of the Grand Canyon, Burrillo brings listeners on an entertaining romp chock-full of history, ecology, cultural preservation, and personal stories. In the vein of Bill Bryson, Tim Cahill, and Ellen Meloy, Burrillo's is a fresh voice in humor-spiked nature writing and cultural commentary. Running throughout the wide-ranging topics of The Backwoods of Everywhere are themes of place and locality, and how these vary between cultures and individuals. Marrying the intensely personal with the complex and technical, Burrillo's candid voice brings humor, wonder, irony, and wit to each thought-provoking essay. "

                "A hilariously-honest, heartwarming essay collection about life, love, and discovering you have ADHD at age 35     Despite being a published writer with a family, a gaggle of internet fans, and (most shockingly) a mortgage, Emily Farris could never get her sh*t together. As she saw it, disorganization was one of her countless character flaws\u2014that is until she was diagnosed with ADHD at age 35. Like many girls who go undiagnosed, Emily grew up internalizing criticisms about her impulsivity and lack of follow-through. She held onto that shame as she tried (and often failed) to fit into a world designed for neurotypical brains.    I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is a personal essay collection of laugh-out-loud-funny, tear-jerking, and at times cringey true stories of Emily's experiences as a neurodivergent woman. With the newfound knowledge of her ADHD, Emily candidly reexamines her complicated relationships (including one with a celebrity stalker), her money problems, the years she spent unknowingly self-medicating, and her hyperfixations (two words: decorative baskets).     A memoir-in-essays both entertaining and enlightening,  I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is for people with ADHD, as well as those who know and love them. This is a powerful collection of deeply relatable, wide-ranging stories about a woman's right to control her own body, about overwhelm and oversharing, about drinking too much and sleeping too little, and about being misunderstood by the people closest to you. At its heart,  I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is about not quite fitting in and not really understanding why\u2014something we've all felt whether we're neurodivergent or not. "

We read to encounter new worlds, to discover new recipes, to find connection across difference, or simply to pass a rainy afternoon. No matter the reason, books have the power to keep us safe, to challenge us, and perhaps most importantly, to make us more fully human. Shannon Reed, a longtime teacher, lifelong reader, and New Yorker contributor, gets it. With one simple goal in mind, she makes the case that we should read for pleasure above all else. In this whip-smart, laugh-out-loud-funny collection, Reed shares surprising stories from her life as a reader and the poignant ways in which books have impacted her students. From the varied novels she cherishes (Gone Girl, Their Eyes Were Watching God) to the ones she didn't (Tess of the d'Urbervilles), Reed takes us on a rollicking tour through the comforting world of literature, celebrating the books we love, the readers who love them, and the ways in which literature can transform us for the better.

From pop culture podcaster and a voice of a generation, Kate Kennedy, a celebration of the millennial zeitgeist    One In a Millennial  is an exploration of pop culture, nostalgia, the millennial zeitgeist, and the life lessons learned (for better and for worse) from coming of age as a member of a much-maligned generation. Kate is a pop culture commentator and host of the popular millennial-focused podcast  Be There in Five . Part-funny, part-serious, Kate navigates the complicated nature of celebrating and criticizing the culture that shaped her as a woman, while arguing that great depths can come from surface-level interests. With her trademark style and vulnerability,  One In a Millennial  is sharp, hilarious, and heartwarming all at once. She tackles AOL Instant Messenger, purity culture, American Girl Dolls, going out tops, Spice Girl feminism, her feelings about millennial motherhood, and more. Kate's laugh-out-loud asides and keen observations will have you nodding your head and maybe even tearing up.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

He knew it and so did everyone else. He was grumpy, increasingly boring, mostly joyless. So, he joined a lawn bowls club. A week later, he doubled down on the doldrums by learning to dance like they do in Bollywood. Then - with an almost entirely reformed selfhood winking appealingly just around the corner - he started swimming in cold water and was back to square one. Despite the setbacks (and hyperventilation), it was becoming clear to him that the very pursuit of fun was a great way of not feeling naff. And so he made a vow to have as much of the f-stuff as he possibly could. Taking a liberal approach to the subject, he sought out things that he used to find fun a long time ago (i.e. food fights and wrestling); things that he'd never done before but reckoned could be fun (boozy French cooking classes, tantric sex); things whose fun-factor was less obvious and more down to earth (nostalgia, volunteering, edible gardening, watching chickens); and things that he wasn't at all sure about but were fun according to other people (gym classes, caving, TikTok). Unsurprisingly, the results were mixed, but he was undoubtedly left feeling ... better. Which left him asking, if fun is the finest medicine, why do we stop doing it?. "

                "A tribute to and exploration of the magic behind one of Hollywood's most legendary and unknowable stars, Keanu Reeves, and the profound lessons we can learn from his success  There can be no doubt: Keanu Reeves is a phenomenon. He's at once a badass action star, a hunky dreamboat who People magazine has called \"the Internet's boyfriend,\" a vintage motorcycle enthusiast, a niche art book publisher, a living meme, and a legend. He seems to upend every rule governing celebrity in the twenty-first century. But how?  In Keanu Reeves: Most Triumphant, cultural critic Alex Pappademas attempts to address Keanu's unmatched eternality and the other big questions raised by his career arc. Sharp, funny, deeply researched, and fully celebratory of the enigmatic actor, this is the first book to take Keanu's whole deal as seriously as it deserves. Yes, even Johnny Mnemonic, where Keanu mind melds with a dolphin. Along the way, Pappademas reveals the lessons we can learn from Keanu about Hollywood, our broader culture, and even life itself. "

Plans for the show, of course, included political satire and Rick\u2019s patented rants. But Rick and his partner, Gerald Lunz, were also determined to do something that comedy tends to avoid as too challenging: they would emphasize the positive. Rick would travel from coast to coast to coast in search of everything that\u2019s best about Canada, especially its people. He found a lot to celebrate, naturally, and was rewarded with a huge audience and a run of 15 seasons.  \u00a0   The Road Years  tells the inside story of that stupendous success. A time when Rick was heading to another town\u2014or military base, sports centre, national park\u2014to try dogsledding, chainsaw carving, and bear tagging; hang from a harness (a lot); ride the \u201cTrain of Death;\u201d plus countless other joyous and/or reckless assignments.   \u00a0  Added to the mix were encounters with the country\u2019s great. Every living prime minister. Rock and roll royalty from Rush to Randy Bachman. Olympians and Paralympians. A skinny-dipping Bob Rae. And Jann Arden, of course, who gets a chapter to herself. Along the way he even found the time to visit several countries in Africa and co-found and champion the charity Spread the Net, which has gone on to protect the lives of millions.  \u00a0  Join the celebration, and revive a wealth of happy memories, with what is Rick Mercer\u2019s funniest, most fascinating book yet.

                "A poignant and moving memoir-in-essays from stand-up comedian Aida Rodriguez on the power of overcoming hardship and transforming pain into laughter.   Aida Rodriguez has, to put it mildly, lived a whirlwind life. Her rags to-riches story is mind-blowing: She was kidnapped as a child by her mother in the Dominican Republic and brought to the US. She was later kidnapped again by her grandmother and uncle, and moved from New York to Florida. As an adult, she ended a difficult marriage and endured homelessness with her children in Los Angeles. But through it all she never lost her sense of humor.  Born with a wonderful wit and an irrepressible spirit, Aida used her gifts and worked tirelessly, turning tragedy and pain into biting comedy that takes on everything from misogyny and racism to social media and news headlines. She eventually released a hit HBO Max special which led to multiple development deals\u2014success that won her a nationwide audience, opened doors, and helped her expand the way Latinos are represented in comedy.   In this, her highly anticipated first book, Aida charts her many ups and downs. From personal setbacks to career highs and everything in between, Legitimate Kid is endearing, shocking, and ultimately life-affirming. "

Dee became a physical education teacher, thinking he would have it made: coaching, summers off and a good pension. But he found himself dreaming of a career in comedy, until one day, years later, he turned in his teaching certificate and picked up a microphone. He went on to become one of Canada's top comics.   In his new book of essays, Dee writes about his life\u2014being a kid in suburban Toronto, becoming a father, starring in his own TV show, going on the road to comedy clubs across Canada and the US. He takes us behind the scenes of Last Comic Standing, Mr. D and everywhere in between. There was the time he set up his own DVD-signing appearances, only to have no one show up. Or the time he was flown to the Bahamas, where he performed for drunken fishermen and their \"nieces.\" And he shares his lifelong affliction with hypochondria and all the medical conditions he doesn't have. This is Gerry Dee at his comedic finest. "

These people deliberately decline steps that would lead to measurable improvements. They prefer that everything goes wrong \u2014 for as long as possible. Sometimes they screw up and accidentally do something right. They're usually able to sabotage these unwanted successes in short order, but they like it best when they can prevent these positive experiences from ever happening in the first place. If you count yourself among this under-acknowledged and under-appreciated group, here are some suggestions for how you can do a better job of staving off success and ensuring absolute failure till you die...

                "The ultimate keepsake for every pickleball fan\u2014from a dink shot to the kitchen, everything a pickleballer needs to know in this guide to the world's greatest recreational sport, packed with lots of joy, good humor, and even a little bit of wisdom.    Pickleball is the fastest growing sport in America. Easy to learn, but impossible to master, it's no wonder that nearly 5 million people nationwide have picked up their paddles and taken to the court. But people aren't just dabbling in this up-and-coming activity, they are obsessed; some hit the court as many as five, six, even seven times a week. As Vanity Fair put it, pickleball has \"won over everyone, from Leonardo DiCaprio to your grandparents.\"  Pickleball Is Life is the first book of its kind celebrating the weird and wonderful world of pickleball. It will take readers on a journey from the sport's quirky origins to its modern-day cult following. Along the way, learn more pickleball knowledge, including etiquette tips, a DIY court, obscure rules, and pointers for (good-natured) trash talk. Also included are interviews with members of the three founding families from Bainbridge Island who are still very much involved in the sport and its growth.  People of all ages, athletic abilities, and backgrounds have fallen in love with pickleball. Sure, it's a good workout, but it's also a cheerful way to interact with others\u2014something folks crave now more than ever. So, whether they're uninitiated or obsessed, this book will help readers find even more to love about the world's greatest sport.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Birdie & Harlow is the story of a baby and a dog. But motherhood is never quite that simple. In Taylor Wolfe's case, it's a long, zigzagging and winding road.  Meant to be a last-minute anniversary gift for her then boyfriend (and now husband), the highly-energetic and loud-mouthed Vizla puppy named Harlow turns out to be the best snap decision twenty-year-old Taylor ever makes\u2014and the beginning of the most epic friendship she ever has. As Wolfe's resistance to 9-5's and traditional adulthood grows, Harlow becomes the perfect companion for her eccentricities in a world that thrives on conformity. Wolfe's twenties\u2014full of pitfalls and surprises, sad days and silver linings\u2014led her to the realization that life is too short to spend your days in a crate (or a cubicle), that parks are meant to be enjoyed, and most importantly, she wants to be a mom. But really, isn't she one already?   A charming and touching memoir, Birdie & Harlow is a tribute to the many expressions of modern motherhood, to both human and fur babies alike. Taylor's story reminds all of us that life will surprise you and that families should come in every shape and size. "

She\u2019s also a successful actor who has written a barrage of thoughtful essays published by the likes of the  New York Times . If you ask her, though, she\u2019s a total fraud. She\u2019d hate to admit it, but no one does impostor syndrome quite like Aparna Nancherla. UNRELIABLE NARRATOR is a collection of essays that uses Aparna\u2019s signature humor to illuminate an interior life, one constantly bossed around by her depression (whom she calls Brenda), laced with anxiety like a horror movie full of jump-scares, and plagued by an unrepenting love-hate relationship with her career as a painfully shy standup comedian. But luckily, crippling self-doubt comes with the gift of keen self-examination.\u00a0These essays deliver hilarious and incredibly insightful meditations on body image, productivity culture, the ultra-meme-ability of mental health language, and who, exactly, gets to make art \u201cabout nothing.\u201d Despite her own arguments to the contrary, UNRELIABLE NARRATOR is undeniable proof that Aparna is a force\u2014as a comedian and author alike\u2014to be reckoned with.

                "A late bloomer's coming-of-age memoir asks how does one accept and free themselves from visible and invisible disabilities and still retain their sense of connection and humor? Nothing Special is a disarmingly candid tale of two sisters growing up in the 1970s in rural Connecticut. Older sister Chris, who has Down syndrome, is an extrovert, while the author, her younger, typically developing sister shoulders the burdens and grief of her parents. In Nothing Special Bilyak offers vignettes that range from heartrending to laugh-out-loud funny as well as a real-world picture of fighting for her own life, finding a place in her family, and strengthening the relationship with her sister.  \"Bilyak's Nothing Special is, despite its witty title, something special. [S]he takes us on a wild ride with her charismatic sister, the unflappable, self-avowed and completely uncowed Dr. Irma King, who just happens to have Down syndrome.\" \u2014Dorion Sagan \"With charming specificity and hilarity, Bilyak writes frankly about her own identity, and that of her sister's. Through honest self-reflection and observation, Bilyak hits home something that we so badly need to hear right now: that people with disabilities are not a monolith, and that there is no perfect way to love or be loved by them.\" \u2015Bekah Brunstetter \"Dianne Bilyak's Nothing Special is wonderfully fulfilling and accessible\u2015you feel like you're reading this incredibly honest diary about the complexities of family that's so relatable!\" \u2015Brian Donovan \"Nothing Special is a revaluation of cultural perceptions of Down syndrome and a realistic portrayal of gritty humor in the face of adversity. Bilyak's honesty is breathtaking, with anecdotes ranging from poignant to laugh-out-loud funny.\" \u2015Richard Blanco. "

All these professionals would watch our son playing while shaking their heads and making tutting sounds, like builders considering a bad job you wanted them to fix. \"Tut tut tut. No speech, disordered social skills, sensory issues. This is going to cost you!!\"' Ashley Blaker has six children, three of whom have an SEN diagnosis. Between endless meetings, countless therapists, public humiliations, failed playdates, surreal monologues and occasional violence, it's certainly not what anyone would call a 'normal' household \u2013 but would he want it any other way? Normal Schmormal is part-memoir, part how-to guide, highlighting the many challenges, as well as the hugely rewarding elements, of parenting children with additional needs. Written with humour, compassion and a lot of love, it's a must-read for parents, carers and teachers of children with SEN, either looking for a bit of support or in need of a very big laugh. "

Lillian Stone\u2014childhood evangelical, AOL girlfriend, and professional nail biter is always living on the edge of anxiety. From the pitfalls of a girl plagued by religious trauma, the incomprehensible yet unforgiving need for perfection, and a poorly-behaved twenty-pound beagle, Everybody's Favorite is a refreshing story of what it means to pick yourself when the world is telling you otherwise. Still navigating the ins and outs of adulthood, accompanied by an obsessive-compulsive disorder that's become an exercise in self-acceptance and thus compassion, Lillian has become an expert in fighting the urge to be someone else's idea of perfect. In this laugh-out-loud essay collection, replete with cringe-inducing touchstones of an early-aughts girlhood, Lillian Stone recounts her quest to be everybody's favorite.  Set largely during the early 2000s Ozarks, and peppered with Stone's biting satire and gloriously self-deprecating personal anecdotes, Everybody's Favorite is a wry, empathetic look at the chaos that ensues when we contort ourselves into an ever-changing assortment of socially acceptable shapes \u2014only to fall out of place, twist an ankle, pee your pants a little, and realize that the pursuit of perfection isn't really all that interesting.

The Great Resignation. Sometimes a literary sensibility catches the spirit of the times. In  I'd Rather Not , Robert Skinner has it all covered. This wonderful audiobook of adventures (and misadventures) in theart of living is wryly subversive and constantly hilarious. It is about work, escape and that something more we all need. 'I was sleeping in what might reasonably be described as a ditch, though I tried not tothink of it in those terms for morale reasons ...' Robert Skinner arrives in the city, searching for a richer life. Things begin badly and then, surprisingly, get slightly worse. Pretty soon he's sleeping rough and trying to run a literary magazine out of a dog park. His quest for meaning keeps being thwarted, by gainful employment, beagles, house parties, ill-advised love affairs, camel trips and bureaucratic entanglements. I'd Rather Not is a deeply funny book of light and shade, triumph and misadventure,where the wisdom is hard-won and promptly forgotten. Yet even when his ventures fail, Robert Skinner succeeds, always, in delighting listeners. For fans of Sloane C rosley, Andrew Sean Greer, Nathan Fielder and David Sedaris. "

                "From Harrison Scott Key, winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor,  How to Stay Married  tells the hilarious, shocking, and spiritually profound story of one man's journey through hell and back when infidelity threatens his marriage.   One gorgeous autumn day, Harrison discovers that his wife\u2014the sweet, funny, loving mother of their three daughters, a woman \"who's spent just about every Sunday of her life in a church\"\u2014is having an affair with a family friend. This revelation propels the hysterical, heartbreaking action of  How to Stay Married , casting our narrator onto \"the factory floor of hell,\" where his wife was now in love with a man who \"wears cargo shorts, on purpose.\" What will he do? Kick her out? Set fire to all her panties in the yard? Beat this man to death with a gardening implement? Ask God for help in winning her back?   Armed with little but a sense of humor and a hunger for the truth, Harrison embarks on a hellish journey into his past, seeking answers to the riddles of faith and forgiveness. Through an absurd series of escalating confessions and betrayals, Harrison reckons with his failure to love his wife in the ways she needed most, resolves to fight for his family, and in a climax almost too ridiculous to be believed, finally learns that love is no joke.  How to Stay Married  is a comic romp unlike any in contemporary literature, a wild  Pilgrim's Progress  through the hellscape of marriage and the mysteries of mercy. "

Comedian and armchair historian Mikey Robins tells the astonishing story of human stupidity, one idiot at a time.   Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the universe . Albert Einstein  History is full of heroes and villains. But then there are the idiots.  Idiots, Follies & Misadventures  shows that human stupidity has always been our constant companion.  History tends to omit tales of human fallibility. We overlook the dubious and ridiculous contributions made by history's tawdry parade of knuckleheads. But this book is a call to arms ... knuckleheads assemble! And once assembled, prepare to be mocked. Just because history has mostly swept these idiots under the carpet does not make them by any means unsung heroes. These are rather ridiculous cautionary tales, to amuse and add some perspective to our current rash of stupidity. Tales such as:   Why you shouldn't soak your underpants in mercury.    The booze cruise that plunged England into civil war.    The Russian nuclear briefcase and pizzas.    Flatulence jars and The Great Plague of London.    The deadly green wallpaper that proved a problem for Britain's trendy middle-class. "

In  We're All In This Together , Papa's thirty-seven short essays tackle these universal American topics, among others: \u2013Love for Your First Car (\"To Buy or Lease\") \u2013The Truth about Personal Hygiene (\"How You Know When It's Time to Go\") \u2013Date Nights (\"Will You Go Out with Me?\") \u2013Unfamiliar Hotel Rooms (\"Why Nothing Works\") \u2013Pets (\"Cats\u2013Ancient Menace\") \u2013Drinking (\"There's no Cure for a Hangover\") \u2013Ducking your Family, even Though you Love Them (\"The Lesson of Mark Twain's Cigars\") Tom Papa's books make readers laugh, but\u2013crucially\u2013feel better about themselves while doing it. And while there's thematic overlap with Papa's stand-up, with a couple of exceptions, all the writing here is fresh for our book.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

                "Overturn everything you knew about history's greatest minds in this raucous and hilarious book, where it turns out there's a finer line between \"genius\" and \"idiot\" than we've previously known.   \"As Albert Einstein almost certainly never said, everyone is a genius \u2013 but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.\" So begins Katie Spalding's spunky takedown of the Western canon, and how genius may not be as irrefutably great as we commonly understand. While most of us may never become Einstein, it may surprise you to learn that there's probably a bunch of stuff you can do that Einstein couldn't. And, as Spalding shows, the famous prodigies she explores here were quite odd by any definition. For example:    Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb, believed that he could communicate with the undead and built the world's very first hotline to heaven: the Spirit Phone.    Marie and Pierre Curie, famous for discovering radioactivity, slept next to a lump of radioactive material for years and strapped it to their arms to watch it burn them in real-time.    Lord Byron, acclaimed British poet, literally took a bear with him to university.    Isaac Newton discovered the laws of gravity and motion, but he also looked up at the sun without eye protection. The result? Three days of blindness.    Tesla, whose scientific work led to the invention of the AC unit, fell in love with a pigeon.    Edison's Ghosts  is filled with examples of the so-called best of humanity doing, to put it bluntly, some really dumb shit. You'll discover stories that deserve to be told but never are: the hilarious, regrettable, and downright bafflingly lesser-known achievements that never made it into our history books, until now. "

Boldly honest, wryly funny, and utterly open-hearted,  Uneducated  is one diploma-less journalist's map of our growing educational divide and, ultimately, a challenge: in our credential-obsessed world, what is the true value of a college degree?  For Christopher Zara, this is the professional minefield he has had to navigate since the day he was kicked out of his New Jersey high school for behavioral problems and never allowed back. From a school for \"troubled kids,\" to wrestling with his identity in the burgeoning punk scene of the 1980s; from a stint as an ice cream scooper as he got clean in Florida, to an unpaid internship in New York in his thirties, Zara spent years contending with skeptical hiring managers and his own impostor syndrome before breaking into the world of journalism\u2014only to be met by an industry preoccupied with pedigree. As he navigated the world of the elite and saw the realities of the education gap firsthand, Zara realized he needed to confront the label he had been quietly holding in: what it looked like to be part of the \"working class\"\u2014whatever that meant.

Samantha Irby makes staying in feel like a luxury, and reminds you that going out is actually quite annoying.'  SARA PASCOE  'Wildly, seditiously funny.'   New York Times   'Sam Irby is the king of sparkling misanthropy and tender, loving dread.'  Jia Tolentino This is not an advice book. Samantha Irby doesn't know anything. After fleeing Chicago to quarantine at home in Michigan, Irby finds herself bleaching groceries and wondering if her upper lip hairs are visible on Zoom. Her career reaches new heights: she gets to work with the iconic ladies of Sex and the City - her dream! - but behind the new-found glam, Irby is just trying to keep her life together. Our friend in print is back, on point, and ready to take us with her, from adopting Abe (her scrawny, watery-eyed firstborn dog) to her favourite, extremely specific porn searches (including two old nuns).

                "NEW YORK TIMES  BESTSELLER \u2022 An\u00a0honest, inspiring, and laugh-out-loud funny memoir about re-energizing our politics and standing up to corporate America\u2014while carting three kids around in a minivan.   \u00a0  \u201cJust like her whiteboard schoolings of CEOs, this book showcases Katie\u2019s ability to entertain while making the inner workings of Congress more accessible than\u00a0ever before.\u201d\u2014Julia Louis-Dreyfus  Never having run for office before, Katie Porter charted a new path in 2018 when she was elected to Congress\u00a0as a Democrat in historically conservative Orange County, California. Underestimated as a single mom and chided for her progressive values, Katie\u00a0defied expectations. Then, using her signature whiteboard, she began to take CEOs and corrupt government officials to task in Congressional hearings. The videos went viral, introducing Americans to her no-bullshit style, and making her a\u00a0coveted guest on cable news and late-night television. \u00a0 \u00a0  I SWEAR: Politics Is Messier Than My Minivan  is a witty, down-to-earth exploration of what it\u2019s really like to serve in Congress, particularly as a single mom. Katie offers Americans a clear picture of what their elected leaders are doing\u2014and how they\u2019re doing\u00a0it\u2014exposing the gaps between politicians\u2019 press conferences and real people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 \u00a0 Katie reveals how her challenges as an Iowa farmgirl\u00a0diverted her to the Ivy League and how she came to\u00a0see herself as a Californian, teaching law and raising three kids in Orange County. She shares\u00a0why she made the jump from academia to politics and how she quickly mastered the art of making CEOs and cabinet members squirm when they bluff and bloviate instead of\u00a0doing the job for America. \u00a0 With the same clarity she demonstrates in Congressional hearings, Katie makes the case for consumer protection, corporate accountability, and anti-corruption reforms. She pulls back the curtain on the political messaging machine, campaign fundraising, and Congress\u2019 traditions, showing\u00a0that\u00a0the way things have always worked, in fact, does not work for a Congressperson\u00a0without someone at home to do the shopping and take care of the kids. Along the way, she provides whiteboard lessons on where your campaign donations go, how to fight the corporations that cheat you, and how to conduct her trademark robust\u00a0oversight.\u00a0 \u00a0 Full of candid and inspiring stories\u2014from how Katie lent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a pair of sneakers during the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, to her kids\u2019 lightly illegal campaign hijinks\u2014this is a book by an exhausted, committed parent who just doesn\u2019t have the time for nonsense\u00a0in her house or in the House of Representatives.

                "Can jokes win a hostile room, a hopeless argument, or even an election? You bet they can, according to Cicero, and he knew what he was talking about. One of Rome's greatest politicians, speakers, and lawyers, Cicero was also reputedly one of antiquity's funniest people. After he was elected commander-in-chief and head of state, his enemies even started calling him \"the stand-up Consul.\" How to Tell a Joke provides a lively new translation of Cicero's essential writing on humor alongside that of the later Roman orator and educator Quintilian. The result is a timeless practical guide to how a well-timed joke can win over any audience. As powerful as jokes can be, they are also hugely risky. The line between a witty joke and an offensive one isn't always clear. Cross it and you'll look like a clown, or worse. Here, Cicero and Quintilian explore every aspect of telling jokes-while avoiding costly mistakes. Presenting the sections on humor in Cicero's On the Ideal Orator and Quintilian's On the Orator's Education, How to Tell a Joke examines the risks and rewards of humor and analyzes basic types that listeners can use to write their own jokes. Filled with insight, wit, and examples, including more than a few lawyer jokes, How to Tell a Joke will appeal to anyone interested in humor or the art of public speaking. "

Priestley is one of our literary icons of the 20th Century and it is time that we all became re-acquainted with his genius.' Dame Judi Dench 'My apology, my little bit of penitence, for having grumbled so much, for having darkened the breakfast table, almost ruined the lunch, nearly silence the dinner party, for all the fretting and chafing, grousing and croaking, for the old glum look and the thrust-out lower lip. So my long-suffering kinsfolk, my patient friends, may a glimmer of that delight which has so often possessed me, but perhaps too frequently in secret, now reach you from these pages.' There are times when there doesn't seem much to smile about. And for those times, there is this book. J. B Priestley's 1949 classic teaches us that joy may be found in even the simplest things, and that we all have the capacity to appreciate them. Delight comprises a series of short essays, all focussing on a single simple pleasure, from reading detective stories in bed to smoking a pipe in the bath; from 'Cosy planning' to the earliest summer mornings; and from mineral water in the bedrooms of foreign hotels to the smell of bacon in the morning. Combining poignant memories of his childhood with glimpses of his interior world, panoramas of life abroad with thoughts about writing, music, theatre \u2013 some strictly personal, some universal \u2013this highly readable book bursts with humour and literary flare on every page.

                "Social media star and comedian Josh Sundquist takes readers on his hilarious journey to the fringes of viral stardom to discover if it's possible to be both very famous  and  very happy.  As a semi-famous internet creator, Josh Sundquist knows what it's like to chase fame, but he also knows that more fame usually means more stress. So he set out on a pseudo-scientific investigation to   find out if there is any way for fame and happiness to overlap. He attempts to define the word \"fame\"\u2014hint: it's harder than you'd think. He turns back time to identify the first facially-recognizable celebrity (you might know his former BFF Brutus). He digs into the numbers to debunk urban legends associated with stardom (ever heard of the 27 Club?). He talks to other semi-famous people (from K-pop sensations to former child stars) and asks them: Is this fame thing making you happy? If not, why are you doing it? If so, what's your secret? All while recounting funny stories about his own cringy fame-seeking (like his many attempts, and failures, to get onto MTV). Packed with playful diagrams, fascinating insights from celebrities, and embarrassing truths from Josh's experience with semi-fame, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever dreamed of becoming famous...or at least going viral on TikTok.

Ingall and McCarthy break down thorny questions...with grace and humor.\"  \u2014 Peggy Orenstein, bestselling author of  Boys & Sex ,  Girls & Sex , and  Cinderella Ate My Daughter   It's a truth universally acknowledged that terrible apologies are the worst .  We've all been on the receiving end, and oh, how they make us seethe. Horrible public apologies\u2014excuse-laden, victim blame-y, weaselly statements\u2014often go viral instantaneously, whether they're from a celebrity, a politician, or a blogger. We all recognize bad apologies when we hear them. So why is it so hard to apologize well? How can we do better? How could  they  do better?   Marjorie Ingall and Susan McCarthy show us the way. Drawing on a deep well of research in psychology, sociology, law, and medicine, they explain why a good apology is hard to find and why it doesn't have to be. Alongside their six (and a half)-step formula for apologizing beautifully, Ingall and McCarthy also delve into how to respond to a bad apology; why corporations, celebrities, and governments seldom apologize well; how to teach children to apologize; how gender and race affect both apologies and forgiveness; and most of all, why good apologies are essential, powerful, and restorative. A good apology can do so many things\u2014mend fences, heal wounds, and bring more harmony into ourselves and our society at large.   With wit, deep introspection, and laugh-out-loud humor, Ingall and McCarthy's guidance will help make the world a better place, one apology at a time. "

                "A new collection of hilarious, intergenerational anecdotes full of absurd detail about everyday experiences of racism from the  New York Times  bestselling authors of  You'll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey , comedian Amber Ruffin and her sister Lacey.  Families may not always see eye to eye; we get on each other's nerves, have different perspectives and lives\u2014especially when we consider how we've grown up in different generations. But for the Ruffin family and many others, there has been one constant that connects them: racism hasn't gone anywhere. From her raucous musical numbers to turning upsetting news into laughs as the host of  The Amber Ruffin Show  or in her  Late Night with Seth Meyers  segments, Amber is no stranger to finding the funny wherever she looks. With equal parts heart and humor, she and her sister Lacey Lamar shared some of the eye-opening and outrageous experiences Lacey had faced in Nebraska in their first book. Now, the dynamic duo makes it clear\u2014Lacey isn't the only one in the family with ridiculous encounters to share! Amber and Lacey have many more uproarious stories, both from their own lives and the entire Ruffin family. Recounting the wildest tales of racism from their parents, their siblings, and Amber's nieces and nephews, this intergenerational look at ludicrous (but all too believable) everyday racism as experienced across age, gender, and appearance will have you gasping with shock  and  laughter in turn. Validating for anyone who has first-hand experience, and revealing for anyone who doesn't, Amber and Lacey's next book helps us all find the absurdity in the pervasive frustrations of racism. Illuminating and packed with love and laughter, this is a must-read for just about everyone. "

                "A laugh-out-loud funny collection of insightful and razor-sharp essays on motherhood in our post-apocalyptic world from comedian Natasha Leggero.  When Natasha Leggero got pregnant at forty-two after embarking on the grueling IVF process, she was over the moon. But once her feelings of bliss dissipated, she couldn't help but shake the lingering question:  Am I doing this right?  And then,  Should I be doing this if the world is about to end?    In  The World Deserves My Children , Natasha explores themes like \"geriatric\" motherhood, parenting in an environmental panic, fear and love, discipline (and conflicting schools of thought on how not to raise a brat), and more. Ultimately, Natasha determines that motherhood is worth it.  After all,   where do you think the next five generations of humans will be if the only people who are having kids don't believe in science? The world deserves my children. "

Great book, I'm loving this' Chris Evans, BBC Radio 2  It can be much harder than it seems; commas, colons, semi-colons and even apostrophes can drive us all mad at times, but it riles no one more than the longest-serving resident of  Countdown 's Dictionary Corner, grammar guru Gyles Brandreth. In this brilliantly funny tirade and guide, Gyles anatomizes the linguistic horrors of our times, tells us where we've been going wrong (and why) and shows us how, in future, we can get it right every time. Is 'alright' all right? You'll find out right here. From dangling clauses to gerunds, you'll also discover why Santa's helpers are subordinate clauses. In  Have You Eaten Grandma?  he waxes lyrical about the importance of language as, after all, it is what we use to define ourselves and, ultimately, is what makes us human.  And why not check out the Have You Eaten Grandma? podcast, starring Gyles and a host of other grammar and linguisitic lovers and experts. "

It's a low one, so he gets a promotion within his first six months on the job.     Four comedy writers transform classic joke setups into sharp commentary about the everyday and structural sexism that pervades all facets of life.  Jokes to Offend Men  arms readers with humorous quips to shut down workplace underminers, condescending uncles, and dismissive doctors, or to share with their exhausted friends at the end of a long day. A cutting, cathartic spin on the old-fashioned joke book,  Jokes to Offend Men  is a refreshing reclamation of a tired form for anyone who's ever been told to \"lighten up, it's just a joke!\" "

Buy this book\u2014you\u2019ll be glad you did.\u201d\u2014Larry the Cable Guy      John Crist wasn\u2019t always recognizable as \u201cthe guy from that hilarious video in the grocery store.\u201d Growing up part of a homeschool family of ten in rural Georgia with Mennonite grandparents and a high-school job at Chick-fil-A, he was an unlikely candidate for internet fame. Despite all that, or perhaps because of it, Crist passionately pursued his dream of stand-up comedy. \u00a0 In his first book, Crist offers heartfelt, laugh-out-loud observations on the absurd ways we all try to make ourselves look better online: like how we all post filtered pictures of our super healthy kale salads but somehow neglect to post about our 1 A.M. Uber Eats Big Mac. Or how quick we all are to post our \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker pictures but fail to post about the ways we vote with our dollars every day in ways that don\u2019t align with our loudly and publicly espoused values. \u00a0 With self-deprecating wit, Crist chronicles his meteoric rise as an online and stand-up comedian, but he doesn\u2019t gloss over the ways his own life choices did not align with his online image\u2014a gap between perception and reality that eventually led to a stint in rehab. \u00a0 In  Delete That,  Crist takes responsibility for his actions, offers some reflections on how to do better, and encourages us all to stop capitulating to the fear of \u201cBut what will they think?!\u201d Instead, this book offers a bold invitation to stop curating life and start living it . . . one Nickelback concert at a time.

Nora McInerny does  not  dance like no one is watching. In fact, she dances like everyone is watching, which is to say, she does not dance at all. A bestselling author and host of the beloved podcast  Terrible, Thanks for Asking , she has captured the hearts of millions with her disarming and earnest approach to discussing grief and loss. Now, with  Bad Vibes Only , she turns her eye on our aggressively, oppressively optimistic culture, our obsession with self-improvement, and what it really means to live authentically in the online age.   In essays that revisit her cringey past and anticipate her rapidly approaching, early middle-aged future, McInerny lays bare her own chaos, inviting us to drop the fa\u00e7ade of perfection and embrace the truth: that we are all\u2014at best\u2014slightly unhinged.

                "GrubHub founder Mike Evans reveals the inside story of how he grew a multibillion-dollar behemoth that changed the way we eat.   Hungry and tired one night, Mike wanted a pizza, but getting a pizza delivered was a pain in the neck. He didn't want to call a million restaurants to see what was open. So, as an avid coder, he created GrubHub in his spare bedroom to figure out who delivered to his apartment. Then, armed with a $140 check from his first customer and ignoring his crushing college debt, he quit his job. Over the next decade, Mike grew his little delivery guide into the world's premier online ordering website. In doing so, he entered the company of an elite few entrepreneurs to take a startup from an idea all the way to an IPO.    GrubHub's journey from Mike's bedroom to Wall Street doesn't fit into how business schools teach entrepreneurship. In Hangry, he details step-by-step the grind of building an innovative business, with each chapter including sharp lessons for entrepreneurs and startups that Mike learned on the fly as he piloted GrubHub by the seat of his pants. Hangry reveals a decade of eighty-hour work weeks, detailed steps of how Mike garnered his first customers, his hunt for financing dollars, cliffhanger acquisitions, the near collapse of his marriage, a brutally difficult merger, and a pair of tumultuous quit/unquit moments, all to steer the company to become one of the most successful startups in the world. With a razor-sharp wit, Mike reveals hard-won truths about how startups succeed\u2014and even harder-won truths about how startups fail.    Shocking everyone, at the pinnacle of startup success, Mike leaves it all behind, quitting the company he started to bike across the United States in search of balance. But eventually, the grand vistas of America bring the lessons of the past into focus, driving the realization that for entrepreneurs a hunger for success doesn't end, and he starts another company, even more ambitious than the first.

From the moment we accept a new role, we're thrown into a world of competing personalities, shifting protocols, and an endless stream of emails, Slack messages, and Zoom calls, all of which serve to distract us from the things we truly want to be doing, like eating Thai food and sleeping until noon.  I Hope This Email Finds You Never puts aside the motivational screeds, productivity hacks, and pop-science, and focuses instead on those things in the workplace that truly cause us grief\u2014like a coworker eating an apple during a video call\u2014in a lighthearted, entertaining, and (most importantly) cynical way.  Some things you'll learn:  How long you can get away with being \"new\" until you're held accountable  How to make it look like you're sorry without giving up any power  How to find a workplace friend and make a workplace enemy  Camera position: how to set up your laptop for maximum dominance  Organizing your calendar while leaving time to cry  The rules of the kitchen (stealing someone's yogurt is literally a crime)  Writing a letter of resignation when you've already been resigned from day one     From Orientation (The Descent), Workplace Etiquette (No Eye Contact Before 11 AM), Working Remotely (Wink Wink), Coworkers (Getting Along with your fellow inmates), and everything in between, I Hope This Email Finds You Never is your must-have guide to surviving (thriving is not realistic) in the modern workplace.

                "Darrell Dennis  is a stereotype-busting, politically incorrect Native American/Aboriginal/Shuswap (Only he's allowed to call himself an \"Indian.\" Maybe. Under some circumstances). With a large dose of humour and irreverence, he untangles some of the truths and myths about First Nations: Why do people think Natives get free trucks, and why didn't he ever get one? Why does the length of your hair determine whether you\u2019re good or bad? By what ratio does the amount of rain in a year depend on the amount of cactus liquor you consume? In addition to answering these burning questions, Dennis tackles some tougher subjects. He looks at European-Native interactions in North America from the moment of first contact, discussing the fur trade, treaty-signing and the implementation of residential schools. Addressing misconceptions still widely believed today, Dennis explains why Native people aren't genetically any more predisposed to become alcoholics than Caucasians; that Native religion doesn't consist of worshipping rocks, disappearing into thin air, or conversing with animals; and that tax exemptions are so limited and confusing that many people don't even bother. Employing pop culture examples, personal anecdote and a cutting wit,\u00a0Darrell Dennis\u00a0deftly weaves history with current events to entertain, inform and provide a convincing, readable overview of First Nations issues and why they matter today.

There are presumably more important concerns in Indian Country. More important than humor? Among the Dine/Navajo, a ceremony is held in honor of a baby's first laugh. While the context is different, it nonetheless reminds us that laughter is precious, even sacred. Bury My Heart at Chuck E. Cheese's is a powerful and compelling collection of Tiffany Midge's musings on life, politics, and identity as a Native woman in America. Artfully blending sly humor, social commentary, and meditations on love and loss, Midge weaves short, stand-alone musings into a memoir that stares down colonialism while chastising hipsters for abusing pumpkin spice. She explains why she does not like pussy hats, mercilessly dismantles pretendians, and confesses her own struggles with white-bread privilege. Midge goes on to ponder Standing Rock, feminism, and a tweeting president, all while exploring her own complex identity and the loss of her mother. Employing humor as an act of resistance, these slices of life and matchless takes on urban-Indigenous identity disrupt the colonial narrative and provide commentary on popular culture, media, feminism, and the complications of identity, race, and politics.

In Live Wire, her first book, Kelly shows what really makes her tick. As a professional, as a wife, as a daughter and as a mother, she brings a hard-earned wisdom and an eye for the absurdity of life to every minute of every day. It is her relatability in all of these roles that has earned her fans worldwide and millions of followers on social media. Whether recounting how she and Mark really met, the level of chauvinism she experienced on set, how Jersey Pride follows her wherever she goes, and many, many moments of utter mortification (whence she proves that you cannot, in fact, die of embarrassment) Kelly always tells it like it is. Ms. Ripa takes no prisoners.  Surprising, at times savage, a little shameless and always with humor... Live Wire shows Kelly as she really is offscreen\u2014a very wise woman who has something to say. "

There were conversations that they didn\u2019t know they needed to have, fears that affected how they related to each other, and seasons of\u00a0change that\u00a0put their\u00a0marriage\u00a0to the test.\u00a0 Part of their story reads like a Christian fairytale: high school sweethearts, married in college, never sowed any wild oats,\u00a0with two sons and a thriving\u00a0marriage. But\u00a0there\u2019s\u00a0another side of their story: the night Melissa kicked Kevin out of her car after years of communication problems, the time early in their\u00a0marriage when Kevin bordered on an emotional affair, the way they\u2019ve used social media and podcasts to conduct a no-holds-barred conversation about forbidden topics like jealousy, divorce, and how to\u00a0be\u00a0Christian  and  sex positive. (Because, as Kevin writes, \u201cYour hormones don\u2019t care about your religious beliefs. Your hormones want you to subscribe\u00a0to OnlyFans.\u201d) In  Marriage\u00a0Be\u00a0Hard , the authors provide a hilarious and fresh master class on what it takes to build and maintain a lasting relationship.

                "Former WWE head writer Brian Gewirtz brings readers behind the scenes for an unprecedented look at the chaotic, surreal, unbelievable backstage world of the WWE.  With untold stories from a career spanning over 15 years and featuring the biggest names and controversial moments in wrestling history, THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM is an honest, unflinching look on how an introverted life-long fan unexpectedly became one the most powerful men in all of professional wrestling. For decades wrestling was shrouded in secrecy. It had larger than life personalities, bone crunching physicality and jaw-dropping theatrics but backstage it was an industry devoid of outsiders. Then in 1999, after working together on a special for MTV, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson turned to 26-year old television writer Brian Gewirtz and asked \"You ever consider writing for WWE?\" That question, and its answer, would have a profound effect on both of their lives for years to come. THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM is a story about perseverance, tenacity, and steel chairs. Most writers in the WWE last for a matter of months; Gewirtz was there for over 15 years, writing some of most memorable and infamous storylines in WWE history (covering the \"Attitude Era\", the \"Ruthless Aggression Era\" and into the \"PG\" and \"Reality\" eras).    Throughout this journey Gewirtz found himself becoming both friend and antagonist to some of the biggest names in WWE history \u2013 Stone Cold Steve Austin, John Cena, Stephanie McMahon, Bill Goldberg, Paul Heyman, Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, and the two men who he worked the most closely with WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. These men not only shaped his life professionally but also personally, forcing him to grow and change both as a writer and a human being.    So how does a lifelong fan and outsider break through to become the ultimate insider? How does a low-key personality deal directly with his boss, the most brash, unpredictable \"alpha male\" on the planet, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon? How does one gain respect in a locker room that wants nothing more than to see him disappear? Where does one go when every year in wrestling takes you further away from the writing career you always wanted? Taking advice from his idol, the late \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, when you're so full of fear, there's only one way to push through: become fearless. "

You binge watch television. You feed the dog. You ponder buying bitcoin or dogecoin for your four-legged best friend. And then the next day you do it all over again. This is not the life you or your dog expected. You both need more. Your lab, pug, or poodle was happy when you stopped going to the office. But, frankly, after all these months of having you home, he is over it. What does your dog think? Probably just what laugh-out-loud canine humorist Bark Twain thinks: - Go the Bark to Work. You've been home for months and you're cramping my style. - Go the Bark to Work. I need to get with the poodle next door! - Go the Bark to Work. You need a shave-I'm afraid you have fleas! With this funny opus, Bark Twain joins the pantheon of famous dogs who bring joy to our lives. Move over Snoopy, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Benji, Beethoven, and Lassie; Bark Twain is funnier, snarkier, and more street savvy than you'll ever be. And you just need to . . . Go the Bark to Work!

When Ellen Jovin first walked outside her Manhattan apartment building and set up a folding table with a GRAMMAR TABLE sign, it took about thirty seconds to get her first visitor. Everyone had a question for her. Grammar Table was such a hit\u2014attracting the attention of the New York Times, NPR, and CBS National News\u2014that Jovin soon took it on the road, traveling across the US to answer questions from writers, lawyers, editors, businesspeople, students, bickering couples, and anyone else who uses words in this world.  In Rebel with a Clause, Jovin tackles what is most on people's minds, grammatically speaking\u2014from the Oxford comma to the places prepositions can go, the likely lifespan of whom, semicolonphobia, and more.  Punctuated with linguistic debates from tiny towns to our largest cities, this grammar romp will delight anyone wishing to polish their prose or revel in our age-old, universal fascination with language.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

In this thought-provoking collection of new essays, Mercado examines what it means to be \"polite,\" \"agreeable,\" and \"nice.\" She covers topics from the subtleties of the \"Bad Bitch\" and why women dominate the ASMR market, to what makes her dog an adorable little freak and how you know if you're shy. This is a book about the unspoken trick mirror of our \"good\" intentions: the inherent performance of the social media apology, celebrating men when they do the bare minimum, and why we trust a Midwesterner to watch our stuff when we go pee.  Throughout, she ponders her identity as an Asian woman and asks what \"nice\" even means\u2014and why anyone would want to be it. With writing that is as precise as it is profound, and cultural references that range from trash reality television to the New York Times Sunday-morning crossword puzzle, Mercado uncovers weird, long-overdue truths about our frailties and failings. In the end, she sees them not as a source of shame but as a cause for celebration. Filled with revelations that range from the silly to the serious,  She's Nice Though offers a mind-bending glimpse into the illusions and delusions of contemporary life\u2014and reveals who we *really* are when no one is watching.

                "My Family and Other Animals  meets  The Secret Life of Cows : this rediscovered gem tells the   charming tale of how a baby llama transformed a Welsh farming family forever.    Things llamas like:  Snaffling cherry brandy, Easter eggs, and the  Radio Times . Fluttering movie star eyelashes at surprised visitors. Curling up in 'tea-cosy' position by the fire. Orbiting, helicoptering, and oompahing.  Humming along to classical music. Locking victims in the lavatory.   Things llamas dislike:  Having toenails trimmed by a visiting circus. Being adopted mother to an orphaned lamb. Invitations to star on  Blue Peter .  Accidentally swimming. Snowdonia's rainfall.  The dark.  Ruth Ruck's family live on a Welsh mountain farm, no strangers to cow pats on the carpet and nesting hens in the larder. When dark days strike, they embark on a farming experiment to cheer them all up - but raising a baby llama proves more of an adventure than expected . "

                "Larry Emdur is one of Australia's most popular and enduring TV personalities. Happy As is a memoir of becoming Larry.     Long before the game shows and morning TV, Larry Emdur was just Larry, a cheeky kid from Bondi who grew up paddling round the kiddies' pool on a foam surfboard, and rocking a safari suit and bowl haircut. It was an idyllic childhood growing up in the 1970s and '80s, dominated by endless summers, adventures with mates, sunburnt noses and board rashes, all underpinned by his dad's simple rule: 'Be nice to everyone.'  Told with wit and warmth, Happy As charts Larry's career as a professional show-off, from winner of the Rose Bay Public School marching parade to living-room fixture. From his first 'job' pinching golf balls to that big TV break; from awkward teen romances to true love; from the less-than-impressed prize winners on The Price is Right to unexpectedly bonding with Yoko Ono - this is a life-affirming collection of stories about the enduring love of family and friends, and just how far being nice to everyone will get you.   A perfect blend of nostalgia, side-splitting humour and heartbreaking pathos that will leave you wishing it was the '80s again. "
