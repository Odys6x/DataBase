But in today's highly competitive and fast-paced environment, it has become necessary to manage projects from their inception through to actual delivery of the business-enabling objectives. This requires a different project management approach where project management needs to become part of the business. This book addresses the concepts and issues of business project management, assisting organizations to make the shift from the narrow, strong, technical focus on project management to a broader, more business-oriented focus. Packed with unique concepts, processes and models, it will enable the development of project management skills to complement technical expertise and allow readers to provide the project skills that their customers demand.

But in today's highly competitive and fast-paced environment, it has become necessary to manage projects from their inception through to actual delivery of the business-enabling objectives. This requires a different project management approach where project management needs to become part of the business. This book addresses the concepts and issues of business project management, assisting organizations to make the shift from the narrow, strong, technical focus on project management to a broader, more business-oriented focus. Packed with unique concepts, processes and models, it will enable the development of project management skills to complement technical expertise and allow readers to provide the project skills that their customers demand.

                "The systems and structures that we call 'management' are obsolete. They were developed for smokestack factories, during the industrial era. Devised for producing goods efficiently, management practices are geared to solving technical, left-brain problems: the kind that occurs when production is highly mechanized, work is repetitive, and people labor in isolation. A century later, work has changed but management has not. It is inflexible, top-heavy, and old. In smoke-free offices, 21st Century knowledge workers organize themselves. Creative and agile, they network or team to tackle complex, right-brain problems by interacting and sharing information: talking, texting, asking questions as they make decisions collectively. Beyond Management explains why the tools, rules, competition, and compliance favored by management are actually disorganizing and cause breakdowns at work. It also shows you how to replace out-dated practices with new ones that empower knowledge workers. "

This exciting new book, from award-winning authorities on learning, provides detailed explanations, vivid examples and self-directed exercises that guide readers in developing leadership capacity in themselves, in organizations, and in communities of practice. The Learning Advantage describes a unique approach to leadership, what the authors call learning-directed leadership. Most approaches to leadership emphasize changing the attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors of followers. Learning directed leadership takes another approach. Leadership is not about coercing others to change but about helping others realize their own potential to learn. The Learning Advantage is the first approach to leadership based exclusively on the emerging international discipline of management learning and development. \u20ac The book summarizes the best ideas on management learning into six easy-to-follow, yet complete practices of learning-directed leadership. The book will prove an invaluable tool for leaders interested in improving their own leadership ability and developing new leaders. As the authors state, 'Our aim is pragmatic. We hope to help leaders adopt learning practices that make a difference in their organizations.'. ",

Are underground issues blocking the chance for teamwork? Every workplace has its disagreements and always will. But disruptive conflicts can and should be resolved if the organization and the individuals involved are to move forward. In this immensely helpful guide, business psychologist Kenneth Kaye shows how to build the kind of teamwork that recognizes conflict quickly, deals with it constructively, and parlays it expertly into creativity and growth. Kaye provides a consistent system - not a random bunch of \"feel-good\" quick fixes - for managing conflict among people who must work together closely. ",
                "Best of all, anyone can apply this method; you need not hire a corporate \"shrink\" or pretend to be one yourself! Kaye helps you begin the rooting-out process, then demonstrates how to weave each step into an approach that becomes a way of life throughout the organization. Whether you're a manager who recognizes conflict as the source of wasted time and unhappy customers...a partner in a family enterprise racked by feuds...a business owner fed up with lawsuits, vandalism, or theft by disgruntled workers...a human resources pro who wants to stop the merry-go-round of conflict-related absenteeism, rehiring, and retraining...or anyone who wants a more peaceful and productive workplace...Workplace Wars and How to End Them will put you on the road to positive, self-sustaining, long-term resolutions.

Success hinged on having enough time and money to launch and grow the venture quickly--something many first-time entrepreneurs are. "

What may be acceptable managerial behaviour in one culture may be counterproductive or even unacceptable in another. As managers increasingly find themselves working across cultures, the need to understand these differences has become increasingly important. This book examines why these differences exist and how global managers can develop strategies and tactics to deal with them. The book draws on recent research in anthropology, psychology, and management to explain the cultural and psychological underpinnings that shape managerial attitudes and behaviours. It introduces a learning model to guide in the intellectual and practical development of managers seeking enhanced global expertise. It also offers user friendly conceptual models to guide understanding and exploration of topics, and summarizes and integrates the lessons learned in each chapter in applications oriented \"Manager's Notebooks.\" "
