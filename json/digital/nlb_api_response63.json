                "Yamagishi and Sendo are schoolmates, but that's about as far as their similarities go: one is a short, no-nonsense boxer, while the other is a tall, bookish conspiracy nut. But when they find themselves embroiled in a paranormal phenomenon at school involving plant-faced monster people assimilating innocent victims, it seems they'll have to set aside their differences and work together as best as they can.  Of course, it doesn't help that the only one with any answers to this bizarre situation is a mysterious \"paranormal investigator\" named Akisato, who insists they must find some sort of \"key\" to stop it all \u2014 before giant insects and other preternatural perils from the world \"beyond\" get to them first.  Inspired by Lovecraftian horror and the  Call of Cthulhu,  this is a brand-new manga series from the creator of  Monochrome Factor!. "

On a cross-country, redeye flight from Los Angeles to Boston, ten passengers awaken in Bangor, Maine, to find that the crew and most of their fellow passengers have disappeared. The airport shows no signs of life. Yet they hear \"radio static\" in the distance. Craig Toomey, an irritable investment banker on the verge of a breakdown, believes it is \"The Langoliers,\" monsters he was afraid of as a child who attack those who waste time. It's mystery author Bob Jenkins who first theorizes that they have flown through a time rip. Bob declares they have entered a place that forbids time travelers to observe or interfere with past events. It turns out that Craig is right, in a way. Two creatures, followed by hundreds more, emerge from the forest and head for the plane, consuming everything in their path. Can the survivors manage to fly the plane back to Los Angeles, back to the correct time, before The Langoliers succeed in their deadly mission to destroy the plane and the world? Dinah Bellman, the young blind girl whose aunt did not survive the time rip, has the greatest insight of all.   A spine-tingling, propulsive novella,  The Langoliers  is a brilliant read from the masterful Stephen King. "

Read them now and you can thank me later.\u201d\u2014STEPHEN KING       No one expected the apocalypse would be broadcast via phone call. But in this chilling sequel to  Fever House,  anyone who managed to survive that doomsday call has a harrowing answer to the question, \u201cWhere were you when the Message came through?\u201d  Five years after the event that drove most of the global population to madness, the world is overrun with the \u201cfevered\u201d\u2014once-human, zombielike creatures drawn indiscriminately to violence and murder. In a campaign to restabilize the country, the massive corporation known as Terradyne Industries has merged with the U.S. government in a partnership of dubious motives, quarantining major American cities behind towering walls and corralling the afflicted there with the hope, they say, of developing a vaccine. In Portland, where it all began, guilt-ridden detective John Bonner scours the city\u2019s darkest corners for clues to humanity\u2019s redemption. In New England, Katherine Moriarty mourns the devastating losses of her husband and son while in hiding from Terradyne. And across the ocean in France, a sixteen-year-old girl named Naomi Laurent discovers she has a disturbing and powerful gift\u2014which may just be the key to the world\u2019s salvation. Equal parts gruesome and beautiful,  The Devil by Name  is a heart-stopping, breakneck saga of survival. As its characters\u2019 paths inevitably collide across the ravaged landscape of a post-apocalyptic America, they are united by the desire to not just escape death but to carve out some way to live anew. Everything starts and ends in the fever house. "

Only eleven passengers survive, but landing in an eerily empty world makes them wish they hadn't. Something's waiting for them, you see.     Two Past Midnight : \"Secret Window, Secret Garden\" enters the suddenly strange life of writer Mort Rainey, recently divorced, depressed, and alone on the shore of Tashmore Lake. Alone, that is, until a figure named John Shooter arrives, pointing an accusing finger.     Three Past Midnight : \"The Library Policeman\" is set in Junction City, Iowa, an unlikely place for evil to be hiding. But for small businessman Sam Peebles, who thinks he may be losing his mind, another enemy is hiding there as well\u2014the truth. If he can find it in time, he might stand a chance.     Four Past Midnight : \"The Sun Dog,\" a menacing black dog, appears in every Polaroid picture that fifteen-year-old Kevin Delevan takes with his new camera, beckoning him to the supernatural.

Sloane anticipates a weekend of wine tastings and cozy robes and strategic avoidance of issues she'd rather not confront, like her husband's repeated infidelity. But when they arrive at their rental cottage, it becomes clear Naomi has something else in mind. She wants Sloane to stop letting things happen to her, for Sloane to really live. So Naomi orchestrates a wild night out with a group of mysterious strangers, only for it to take a horrifying turn that changes Sloane's and Naomi's lives literally forever. The friends are forced to come to terms with some pretty eternal consequences in this bloody, seductive novel about how it's never too late to find satisfaction, even though it might taste different than expected.

Get ready to meet the most hideous menace ever to terrorize the town of Castle Rock, Maine.  Outside a peaceful town in central Maine, a monster is waiting. Cujo is a two-hundred-pound Saint Bernard, the best friend Brett Camber has ever had. One day, Cujo chases a rabbit into a cave inhabited by sick bats and emerges as something new altogether.   Meanwhile, Vic and Donna Trenton, and their young son Tad, move to Maine. They are seeking peace and quiet, but life in this small town is not what it seems. As Tad tries to fend off the terror that comes to him at night from his bedroom closet, and as Vic and Donna face their own nightmare of a marriage on the rocks, there is no way they can know that a monster, infinitely sinister, waits in the daylight.   What happens to Cujo, how he becomes a horrifying vortex inescapably drawing in all the people around him, makes for one of the most heart-stopping novels Stephen King has ever written. \"A genuine page-turner that grabs you and holds you and won't let go\" ( Chattanooga Times ),  Cujo  will forever change how you view man's best friend.

But getting out is not easy as it would seem...  Located off a desolate stretch of Interstate 50, Desperation, Nevada, has few connections with the rest of the world. It is a place, though, where the seams between worlds are thin. And it is a place where several travelers are abducted by Collie Entragian, the maniacal police officer of Desperation. Entragian uses various ploys for the abductions, from an arrest for drug possession to \"rescuing\" a family from a nonexistent gunman. There's something very wrong here, all right, and Entragian is only the surface of it.   The secrets embedded in Desperation's landscape, and the evil that infects the town like some viral hot zone, are both awesome and terrifying. But as one of the travelers, young David Carver, seems to know\u2014though it scares him nearly to death to realize it\u2014so are the forces summoned to combat them. \"Stephen King's knack for turning the stray junk of pop culture into sick, darkly engrossing thrills has rarely been this much in evidence as in  Desperation \" ( Salon ).

Three unspeakable horrors.  The Finch sisters once spent long, hot summers exploring the dozens of abandoned properties littering their dying town\u2014until they found an impossible home with an endless hall of doors...and three keys left waiting for them. Curious, fearless, they stepped inside their chosen rooms, and experienced horrors they never dared speak of again.  Now, years later, youngest sister Claire has been discovered dead in that old, desiccated house. Haunted by their sister's suicide and the memories of a past they've struggled to forget, Meg and Esther find themselves at bitter odds. As they navigate the tensions of their brittle relationship, they draw unsettling lines between Claire's death, their own haunted memories, and a long-ago loss no one in their family has ever been able to face. With the house once again pulling them ever-closer, Meg and Esther must find the connection between their sister's death and the shadow that has chased them across the years...before the darkness claims them, too.   As emotional as it is haunting, Through the Midnight Door explores the sometimes-fragile bonds of sisterhood and the way deeply rooted trauma can pass from generation to generation.    \"A gorgeously realized, deeply affecting horror story about sisterhood, secrets, and all the things that can haunt someone.\"\u2014\u00a0Layne Fargo, author of They Never Learn.

                "In this provocative, darkly funny, and unique novel\u2014a mix of Lord of the Flies and The Royal Tenenbaums\u2014a dictator's former right-hand man becomes housebound and a family power struggle erupts.    Growing up on a Cuba-esque Caribbean island, Casandra, Calia, and Caleb endure life under two tyrannies: that of their parents, and the Island's authoritarian dictator, Pop-Pop Mustache. Papa was the dictator's former right-hand man. Now, he's a political pariah and an ugly parody of a tyrant, treating his home as a nation which he rules with an iron fist. As for Mom, his wife and hateful second in command, she rules from the mind. Obsessed with armchair psychoanalysis, she spends her days reading self-help books and seeks to diagnose the kids, and perhaps even herself.  But within these walls, a rebellion is fomenting. Casandra, a cynical, self-important teenager with the most unlikely of attractions, recruits Caleb, meek yet gifted with a deadly touch, to join her in an insurrection against their father's arbitrary totalitarianism. Meanwhile, Calia, the silent, youngest sibling who just wants to be left alone to draw animals, may be in league with the flies\u2014whose swarm in and around the house grows larger as Papa's violence increases.  Equal parts Greek tragedy and horror, with a touch of J.D. Salinger and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, The Tyranny of Flies is a biting and wholly original subversive masterpiece that examines the inherent violence of authority and the frightening and indelible links between patriarchy, military, and family.  Translated from the Spanish by Kevin Gerry Dunn. "

                "Stephen King's  Under the Dome  meets  The Last of Us  in this harrowing dystopian novel about the downward spiral of a seaside town that becomes infected by a mysterious ocean-borne contagion.   If you want to stay, you have to die.   In a small fishing town known for its aging birding community and the local oyster farm, a hidden evil emerges from the depths of the ocean. It begins with sea snails washing ashore, attacking whatever they cling to. This mysterious infection starts transforming the wildlife, the seascapes, and finally, the people.  Once infected, residents of Baywood start \"deading\": collapsing and dying, only to rise again, changed in ways both fanatical and physical. As the government cuts the town off from the rest of the world, the uninfected, including the introverted bird-loving Blas and his jaded older brother Chango, realize their town could be ground zero for a fundamental shift in all living things.  Soon, disturbing beliefs and autocratic rituals emerge, overseen by the death-worshiping Risers. People must choose how to survive, how to find home, and whether or not to betray those closest to them. Stoked by paranoia and isolation, tensions escalate until Blas, Chango, and the survivors of Baywood must make their escape or become subsumed by this terrifying new normal.   At points claustrophobic and haunting, soulful and melancholic,  The Deading  lyrically explores the disintegration of society, the horror of survival and adaptation, and the unexpected solace found through connections in nature and between humans.

Truly wondrous.\"  \u2014KEVIN WILSON    \"Heart-wrenching and wickedly funny.\"  \u2014GWEN KIRBY    \"Propulsive, uncanny, and expertly built.\"  \u2014JULIA FINE   At a Halloween party in 1999, a writer slept with the devil. She sees him again and again throughout her life and she writes stories for him about things that are both impossible and true.  Lima lures readers into surreal pockets of the United States and Brazil where they'll find bite-size Americans in vending machines and the ghosts of people who are not dead. Once there, she speaks to modern Brazilian-American immigrant experiences\u2013of ambition, fear, longing, and belonging\u2014and reveals the porousness of storytelling and of the places we call home.  With humor, an exquisite imagination, and a voice praised as \"singular and wise and fresh\" (Cathy Park Hong), Lima joins the literary lineage of Bulgakov and Lispector and the company of writers today like Ted Chiang, Carmen Maria Machado, and Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah.  Craft: Stories I Wrote for the Devil includes: \"Rapture,\" \"Ghost Story,\" \"Tropic\u00e1lia,\" \"Antrop\u00f3gaga,\" \"Idle Hands,\" \"Rent,\" \"Porcelain,\" \"Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory,\" and \"Hasselblad.\" A great next read for fans of Carmen Maria Machado's  Her Body and Other Parties  and V. E. Schwab's  The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue . Recommended reading by  Chicago Review of Books ,  Electric Literature ,  The Kenyon Review , and more!

                "From one of our most accomplished storytellers, an extraordinary and arresting novel about a women's asylum in the nineteenth century, and a terrifying doctor who wants to change the world. 'Simply the most consistently inventive, brilliant, curious and creative writer going' GILLIAN FLYNN In this harrowing story based on authentic historical documents, we follow the career of Dr. Silas Weir, \"Father of Gyno-Psychiatry,\" as he ascends from professional anonymity to national renown. Humiliated by a procedure gone terribly wrong, Weir is forced to take a position at the New Jersey Asylum for Female Lunatics, where he reigns. There, he is allowed to continue his practice, unchecked for decades, making a name for himself by focusing on women who have been neglected by the state\u2014women he subjects to the most grotesque modes of experimentation. As he begins to establish himself as a pioneer of nineteenth-century surgery, Weir's ambition is fueled by his obsessive fascination with a young Irish indentured servant named Brigit, who becomes not only Weir's primary experimental subject, but also the agent of his destruction. Narrated by Silas Weir's eldest son, who has repudiated his father's brutal legacy, Butcher is a unique blend of fiction and fact, a nightmare voyage through the darkest regions of the American psyche conjoined, in its startling conclusion, with unexpected romance. Once again, Joyce Carol Oates has written a spellbinding novel confirming her position as one of our celebrated American visionaries of the imagination. 'Simply the most consistently inventive, brilliant, curious and creative writer going, as far as I'm concerned' Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl 'A master storyteller' The Times. "

                "From legendary storyteller and master of short fiction Stephen King comes an extraordinary new collection of twelve short stories, many never-before-published, and some of his best EVER.    \"You like it darker? Fine, so do I,\"  writes Stephen King in the afterword to this magnificent new collection of twelve stories that delve into the darker part of life\u2014both metaphorical and literal. King has, for half a century, been a master of the form, and these stories, about fate, mortality, luck, and the folds in reality where anything can happen, are as rich and riveting as his novels, both weighty in theme and a huge pleasure to read. King writes to feel \"the exhilaration of leaving ordinary day-to-day life behind,\" and in  You Like It Darker , readers will feel that exhilaration too, again and again.   \"Two Talented Bastids\" explores the long-hidden secret of how the eponymous gentlemen got their skills. In \"Danny Coughlin's Bad Dream,\" a brief and unprecedented psychic flash upends dozens of lives, Danny's most catastrophically. In \"Rattlesnakes,\" a sequel to  Cujo , a grieving widower travels to Florida for respite and instead receives an unexpected inheritance\u2014with major strings attached. In \"The Dreamers,\" a taciturn Vietnam vet answers a job ad and learns that there are some corners of the universe best left unexplored. \"The Answer Man\" asks if prescience is good luck or bad and reminds us that a life marked by unbearable tragedy can still be meaningful. King's ability to surprise, amaze, and bring us both terror and solace remains unsurpassed. Each of these stories holds its own thrills, joys, and mysteries; each feels iconic. You like it darker? You got it. "

                "White Lotus meets Hereditary in this uproarious and unsettling dissection of a dysfunctional family and their ghosts, both literal and metaphorical. Perfect for fans of Grady Hendrix and Ronald Malfi Anna only has one rule for the annual Pace family vacations: tread lightly, and survive. It isn't easy when she's the only who doesn't seem to fit in. Her twin brother Benny goes with the flow so much he's practically dissolved, and her high-strung older sister Nicole is so used to everyone\u2014including her blandly docile husband and two young daughters\u2014falling in line that Anna often ends up chastised for simply asking a question. Her Mom is baffled by Anna's life choices (why waste her artistic talent at an ad agency?), and her Dad\u2014well, he just wants a little peace and quiet. The gorgeous villa outside a remote Tuscan town seems like the perfect place to endure so much family time\u2014not to mention Benny's demanding new boyfriend, Christopher. If her family becomes too much to handle, then at least Anna can wander off to a wine tasting or lose herself in an art gallery. That is, until strange things start to happen\u2014strange noises at night, food rotting within hours, dreams that feel more like memories. Then, the unsettling warnings from the locals: don't open the tower door. But Anna does open it. And what she releases threatens to devour her family\u2014that is, if her family doesn't tear itself apart first. "

But Black Stone feels off; it's a disquieting place surrounded by towns with some of the highest death rates in the country. It doesn't help that everyone says Ellis's new house is haunted \u2014 everyone including Quinn, a local girl who has quickly captured Ellis's attention. And Ellis has started to believe what people are saying: they see pulsing veins in their bedroom walls and specters in dark corners of the cellar. Together, Ellis and Quinn dig deep into Black Stone's past and soon discover that their town, and Ellis's house in particular, is the battleground in a decades-long spectral war, one that will claim their family \u2014 and the town \u2014 if it's allowed to continue.    Withered  is queer psychological horror, a compelling tale of heartache, loss, and revenge that tackles important issues of mental health in the way that only horror can: by delving deep into them, cracking them open, and exposing their gruesome entrails.

                "Can killing be an act of love? Hypnotic, gruesome, and exultant, Joy Sorman's macabre ballet whirls from industrial slaughterhouses to the boutique butcher shops of Paris.   Pim is a delicate youth\u2014stringy, solemn, and prone to bouts of unexplained weeping. When he enrolls in trade school as an apprentice butcher, his mentors have low expectations, but his lanky body conceals a peculiar flame: a passionate devotion to animals. In an industry that strives to distance the chopping block from the dinner plate, his ardor might seem like a handicap, but Pim rises through the knife-wielding ranks with a barely-tethered zeal. He scours blood from floor mats and stacks carcasses in the cold room by day. By night he tries to slake his appetites: at the table, over boudin sausage and steak tartare, and in bed, with women whose flanks, ribs, and haunches he maps as they undress each other.  Pim's professional successes mount but his cravings gnaw. In the library he teases out histories, like the blood-drinking forerunners to vampirism or the Medieval trial of a killer pig, sentenced to death by hanging. Meat crowds his waking thoughts. Even as he carves ripe flesh from exquisite bone, he labors to close the gap between man and beast\u2014to be seen, understood, even loved, by a primordial mind. Will this ravenous obsession yield to madness, or to ecstasy?  With shades of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, Joy Sorman's Tenderloin is an ethical foray, fever dream, and paean to an ageless hunger. Vegetarians and carnivores alike are invited to feast at this sumptuous literary table. After all, we are what we eat. "

High school is hard enough to survive without an apocalypse to navigate.    Sid Spencer has always been the most normal girl in her abnormal hometown, a tourist trap built over one of the fault lines that seal magic away from the world. Meanwhile, all Sid has to deal with is hair-ruining humidity, painful awkwardness, being one of four Asians in town, and her friends dumping her when they start dating each other\u2014just days after one of the most humiliating romantic rejections faced by anyone, ever, in all of history.    Then someone kills one of the Guardians who protect the seal. The earth rips open and unleashes the magic trapped inside. Monsters crawl from the ground, no one can enter or leave, and the man behind it all is roaming the streets with a gang of violent vigilantes. Suddenly, Sid's life becomes a lot less ordinary. When she finds out her missing brother is involved, she joins the remaining Guardians, desperate to find him and close the fault line for good.    Fighting through hordes of living corpses and uncontrollable growths of forest, Sid and a ragtag crew of would-be heroes are the only thing standing between their town and the end of the world as they know it. Between magic, murderers, and burgeoning crushes, Sid must survive being a perfectly normal girl caught in a perfectly abnormal apocalypse.    Only\u2014how can someone so ordinary make it in such an extraordinary world?. "

An astounding accomplishment!\"  \u2014 R. L. Stine , author of\u00a0 Goosebumps  Set in 19th century Sri Lanka and inspired by local folklore, the daughter of a traditional demon-priest\u2014relentlessly bullied by peers and accused of witchcraft herself\u2014tries to solve the mysterious attacks that have been terrorizing her coastal village.  Being the daughter of the village Capuwa, or demon-priest, Amara is used to keeping mostly to herself. Influenced by the new religious practices brought in by the British Colonizers, the villagers who once\u00a0respected her father\u2019s craft have turned on the family. Yet, they all still seem to call on him whenever supernatural disturbances arise. Now someone\u2014or  something \u2014is viciously seizing upon men in the jungle. But instead of enlisting Amara\u2019s father\u2019s help, the villages have accused him of carrying out the attacks himself. As she tries to clear her father\u2019s name, Amara finds herself haunted by dreams that eerily predict the dark forces on her island. And she can\u2019t shake the feeling that it\u2019s all connected to the night she was recovering from a strange illness, and woke up, scared and confused, to hear her mother\u2019s frantic cries:  No one can find out what happened .

Barnes, acclaimed author of  Dead Silence .  An abandoned plant. A hidden past. A deadly danger. Psychologist Dr. Ophelia Bray has dedicated her life to the study and prevention of Eckhart-Reiser syndrome (ERS)\u2014the most famous case of which resulted in the brutal murders of twenty-nine people. It's personal to her, and when she's assigned to a small exploration crew who recently suffered the tragic death of a colleague, she wants to help. But as they begin to establish residency on an abandoned planet, it becomes clear that the crew is hiding something. Ophelia's crewmates are far more interested in investigating the eerie, ancient planet and unraveling the mystery behind the previous colonizers' hasty departure than opening up to her. That is, until their pilot is discovered gruesomely murdered. Is this Ophelia's worst nightmare starting\u2014a wave of violence and mental deterioration from ERS? Or is it something even more sinister? Terrified that history will repeat itself, Ophelia and the crew must work together to figure out what's happening. But trust is hard to come by...and the crew isn't the only one keeping secrets. Also by S.A.

                "A poignant and evocative novel that explores the bounds of familial love, the high stakes of parenthood, and the tenuous divide between fiction and reality.  Thirteen years ago, Sylvia Gray's young daughter, Faye, attacked her babysitter in order to impress the Kingman, a monster she and her best friend had encountered on the Internet. When the now twenty-three-year-old Faye goes missing, leaving her toddler behind, Sylvia launches a search that propels her back into the past and back into the Kingman's orbit. With the help of her estranged husband and a sister she hasn't spoken to in years, Sylvia draws dangerously closer not only to Faye, but also to the truth about the monster that once inspired her. Will Sylvia be able to reach her daughter before history repeats itself? Or will it be Sylvia, this time, who loses her grip on reality and succumbs to the dark powers of this monstrous fiction? Both literary and suspenseful,  Monsters We Have Made  confronts the terrors of parenthood and examines the boundaries of love. Most importantly, it reminds us of the power of stories to shape our lives. "

The Spear of Ala\u2014the fortress that stands at the gates of the demon's hive\u2014is the last bastion against the horde, and reports say it may already have fallen. Olive Paper is expected to take the vanguard in the fight.

But Olive does not wish to follow in her father's footsteps any more than she did her mother's.

Yet to save his mother from the clutches of Alagai Ka, the demon king, Darin will brave anything to mount a rescue. Darin and Olive each strive to walk their own path but find themselves inextricably tied to the legacies of their parents and to a fated confrontation with the demon king and his new hatchling queen.

The Velkwood Vicinity was the topic of occult theorists, tabloid one-hour documentaries, and even some pseudo-scientific investigations as the block of homes disappeared behind a near-impenetrable veil that only three survivors could enter\u2014and only one has in the past twenty years, until now.   Talitha Velkwood has avoided anything to do with the tragedy that took her mother and eight-year-old sister, drifting from one job to another, never settling anywhere or with anyone, feeling as trapped by her past as if she was still there in the small town she so desperately wanted to escape from. When a new researcher tracks her down and offers to pay her to come back to enter the vicinity, Talitha claims she's just doing it for the money. Of all the crackpot theories over the years, no one has discovered what happened the night Talitha, her estranged, former best friend Brett, and Grace, escaped their homes twenty years ago. Will she finally get the answers she's been looking for all these years, or is this just another dead end?   Award-winning author Gwendolyn Kiste has created a suburban ghost story about a small town that trapped three young women who must confront the past if they're going to have a future. "

                "\"  A surreal, riveting, keep-the-lights-on masterwork of horror . . . I will be haunted by this book for years to come.\" \u2014Kim Fu, author of  Lesser Known Monsters of the 21st Century     I know this place.   The room is too dim to see clearly.   It smells like the bones.     Yewon dreams of a hotel. In the hotel, there are infinite keys to infinite rooms\u2014and a quiet terror she is both eager to understand and desperate to escape. When Yewon wakes, she sees her life: a young woman, out of her job at a convenience store, trapped in the tiny South Korean village of her birth, watching her mother wash the bones of their ancestors in their decrepit bathtub. Every house has them, these rotting and fragmented ribs, tibias, and femurs, whose constant care and persistent stench serve as reminders of what they have all lost to the Forgotten War that never seems to end.  Now Yewon's brother is stationed near the North Korean border, her sister has experienced a life-changing tragedy, and her mother is overwhelmed by anxiety, her health declining. When Yewon begins to drive a local woman named Ms. Han, a mysterious and aging North Korean refugee, to visit her brother at a distant prison, Yewon's dreams intensify. As the line between reality and illusion slowly begins to blur, Yewon is led to an unsettling truth about her country's collective heritage. A work of literary horror in the gothic tradition,  The Invisible Hotel  is a startling, speculative tale of a woman in crisis and in stasis, and a country's shifting identity in the long afterlife of the Korean War.

Retired soldier, Alex Easton, returns in a horrifying new adventure.   *A very special hardcover edition, featuring a foil stamp on the casing and custom endpapers illustrated by the author.*  After their terrifying ordeal at the Usher manor, Alex Easton feels as if they just survived another war. All they crave is rest, routine, and sunshine, but instead, as a favor to Angus and Miss Potter, they find themself heading to their family hunting lodge, deep in the cold, damp forests of their home country, Gallacia.  In theory, one can find relaxation in even the coldest and dampest of Gallacian autumns, but when Easton arrives, they find the caretaker dead, the lodge in disarray, and the grounds troubled by a strange, uncanny silence. The villagers whisper that a breath-stealing monster from folklore has taken up residence in Easton's home. Easton knows better than to put too much stock in local superstitions, but they can tell that something is not quite right in their home. . . or in their dreams.

                "The next high concept horror novel from  New York Times  bestselling author Christopher Golden.  Across Italy there are many half-empty towns, nearly abandoned by those who migrate to the coast or to cities. The beautiful, crumbling hilltop town of Becchina is among them, but its mayor has taken drastic measures to rebuild\u2014selling abandoned homes to anyone in the world for a single Euro, as long as the buyer promises to live there for at least five years.  It's a no-brainer for American couple Tommy and Kate Puglisi. Both work remotely, and Becchina is the home of Tommy's grandparents, his closest living relatives. It feels like a romantic adventure, an opportunity the young couple would be crazy not to seize. But from the moment they move in, they both feel a shadow has fallen on them. Tommy's grandmother is furious, even a little frightened, when she realizes which house they've bought.  There are rooms in an annex at the back of the house that they didn't know were there. The place makes strange noises at night, locked doors are suddenly open, and when they go to a family gathering, they're certain people are whispering about them, and about their house, which one neighbor refers to as  The House of Last Resort . Soon, they learn that the home was owned for generations by the Church, but the real secret, and the true dread, is unlocked when they finally learn what the priests were doing in this house for all those long years...and how many people died in the strange chapel inside. While down in the catacombs beneath Becchina...something stirs. "

                "\"A fierce, furious, and fearless debut that has its finger on the pulse\u2014no, the gushing wound\u2014of our world's most invasive cruelties.\"  \u2014Daniel Kraus , New York Times bestselling co-author of  The Shape of Water   \"Masterful . . . Tsamaase has created a disturbing techno dystopia in a future Botswana that terrifies with its echoes of our own increasingly authoritarian cyber-policed world. This beautifully written work haunts and upends expectations with its resurrected ghosts and gods and ancestors of Motswana cosmology. What an accomplished debut!\"  \u2014T. L. Huchu , Caine Prize finalist and author of  The Library of the Dead   This genre-bending Africanfuturist horror novel blends  The Handmaid's Tale  with  Get Out  in an adrenaline-packed, cyberpunk body-hopping ghost story exploring motherhood, memory, and a woman's right to her own body.   Nelah seems to have it all: fame, wealth, and a long-awaited daughter growing in a government lab. But, trapped in a loveless marriage to a policeman who uses a microchip to monitor her every move, Nelah's perfect life is precarious. After a drug-fueled evening culminates in an eerie car accident, Nelah commits a desperate crime and buries the body, daring to hope that she can keep one last secret.  The truth claws its way into Nelah's life from the grave.   As the ghost of her victim viciously hunts down the people Nelah holds dear, she is thrust into a race against the clock: in order to save any of her remaining loved ones, Nelah must unravel the political conspiracy her victim was on the verge of exposing\u2014or risk losing everyone.   Set in a cruel futuristic surveillance state where bodies are a government-issued resource, this harrowing story is a twisty, nail-biting commentary on power, monstrosity, and bodily autonomy. In sickeningly evocative prose,  Womb City  interrogates how patriarchy pits women against each other as unwitting collaborators in their own oppression. In this devastatingly timely debut novel, acclaimed short fiction writer Tlotlo Tsamaase brings a searing intelligence and Botswana's cultural sensibility to the question: just how far must a woman go to bring the whole system crashing down?.

From the foggy streets of Victorian London to the eerie perfection of 1950s suburbia, the everyday is invaded by the evil otherworldly in this unforgettable collection of ghost stories from the author of  The Woman in Black . In the title story, on a murky evening in a warmly lit club off St James, a bishop listens closely as a paranormal detective recounts his most memorable case, one whose horrifying denouement took place in that very building. In 'The Front Room', a devoutly Christian mother tries to protect her children from the evil influence of their grandmother, both when she is alive and when she is dead. A lonely boy finds a friend in 'Boy Number 21', but years later he is forced to question the nature of that friendship and to ask whether ghosts can perish in fires. This is Susan Hill at her best, telling characteristically flesh-creeping and startling tales of thwarted ambition, terrifying revenge and supernatural stirrings that will leave readers wide awake long into the night.
