                "Bad Dogs Have More Fun is an unforgettable collection of more than 75 newspaper columns by John Grogan, the number-one New York Times best-selling author of Marley &amp; Me. Combining humor, wit, poignancy and affection, these columns provide insight into the intriguing and wonderful world we live in. Whether it be writing about animals (from dogs to elephants to geese!), his powerful and moving comments about his own and other families, his trenchant comments on life's foibles and farces, or his interviews and interactions with people who are memorable and unusual in their own right, John Grogan makes us laugh, he makes us cry, he makes us think.
