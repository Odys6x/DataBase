                "As we witness monuments of white Western history fall, many are asking  how is Shakespeare still relevant ?        Professor Farah Karim-Cooper has dedicated her career to the Bard, which is why she wants to take the playwright down from his pedestal to unveil a Shakespeare for the twenty-first century. If we persist in reading Shakespeare as representative of only one group, as the very pinnacle of the white Western canon, then he will truly be in peril.  Combining piercing analysis of race, gender and otherness in famous plays from\u00a0Antony and Cleopatra\u00a0to\u00a0The Tempest\u00a0with a radical reappraisal of Elizabethan London,\u00a0The Great White Bard\u00a0asks us neither to idealize nor bury Shakespeare but instead to look him in the eye and reckon with the discomforts of his plays, playhouses and society. In inviting new perspectives and interpretations, we may yet prolong and enrich his extraordinary legacy. "

Neville \"Bunt\" Mullard and his mother Betty see Hong Kong as part Great Britain a cozy, monotonous, beguilingly pleasant part, in which the family business has afforded them a comfortable living. They can see China from their living room, but they have never been there. Here in Hong Kong it is possible to despise Chinese food while enjoying big breakfasts, high tea, the race meetings at Happy Valley, and the \"Blue hotels\" of Kowloon Tong, where Bunt sometimes rents a room by the hour Certainly they have never been forced to think about the impending \"Chinese take-away\" until mainland businessman Mr. Hugo offer them a tidy sum for their textile factory. Bunt refuses him out of hand, but it soon emerges that this well-spoken gentleman is different from the Hong Kong Chinese the Mullards have lived alongside for years: Mr. Hung will accept no refusals. The disappearance of a young woman from the factory forces Bunt, for the first time in his forty-three years, to make decisions that matter and perhaps to discover love. "

                "\"Our revels now are ended... this rough magic I here abjure...\" Is Shakespeare hinting at the end of his own magnificent career in these and others lines spoken by the great magician, Prospero?  The Tempest  was the last of Shakespeare's comedies, completed just before he retired to his native Stratford-upon-Avon; perhaps this delightful comedy was intended to signal the playwright's farewell to his beloved theater.  The Tempest  reflects Shakespeare's mature genius, with its story of innocence tempered by intrigue, hilarity bounded by melancholy. Audiences the world over still thrill to  The Tempest 's dark comedy and magical fantasy. Sir Michael Redgrave and Vanessa Redgrave helped to build one of England's foremost theatrical families - a tradition that Ms. Redgrave continues today. And Hugh Griffith is one of the nation's greatest character actors. Together, they bring  The Tempest  majestically to life. "

As we spend time with the unusual party, it becomes clear that Kafka's wish was for anonymity \u2013 and also that he had serious issues with his father. When his parent turns up, he is in possession of a very personal secret relating to his son \u2013 one which Kafka is terrified he will disclose...

Yet, despite the author's lack of maturity, the play is unmistakably the work of a burgeoning master. A farce of a type that was wildly popular in Shakespeare's day,  The Comedy of Errors  transcends its genre, and is as accessible and as entertaining as any of the Bard's later comedies. Revolving around the naturally comedic themes of identical twins and mistaken identity,  The Comedy of Errors  is a delightful milestone in the remarkable career of the greatest dramatist of all time.

The novel has been adapted by Martyn Wade, whose previous Radio 4 successes have included \u2018The Barchester Chronicles\u2019. Romantic and gothic elements combine in this tightly-constructed thriller which induces excitement and fear in its audience. A mysterious figure in white appears on Hampstead Heath, before the narration moves to a large North Country house. The novel stands apart from usual Victorian costume dramas which tend to carry domestic and moralistic overtones. Sections of the storyline are taken up by a variety of characters, through whose eyes we experience events. The whole production is being recorded on location, and incidental music will heighten tension and create a filmic quality. "

This exciting new audiobook production is directed with fresh imagination by Fiona Shaw who breaks the conventional strait jacket that has hampered the development of Shakespeare on audio. We are as much in the twenty-first century as in medieval Scotland\u00a0- the tensions, the politics, the struggle for power and dark ambition is part of our lives. This is also reflected in the sound world, with modern machinery and tanks. Macbeth is part of Naxos AudioBooks' exciting new series of complete dramatisations of the works of Shakespeare, in conjunction with Cambridge University Press. It uses the New Cambridge Shakespeare text, as used by the Royal Shakespeare Company and educational institutions across the world. "

                "In these six new pieces Alan Bennett retains the gripping stories, intensity of delivery and masterly style of his original monologues. The suburban normality of the world his characters inhabit once again belies their lives of secrets, revelations, fears, crimes and passions. They tell their stories, and in doing so reveal more than they know of the humour, passion and sadness of their lives.   Alongside the original pieces, these superb monologues form one of the great contributions to television drama.   Included in this collection is:   Miss Fozzard Finds her Feet, with Patricia Routledge  The Hand of God, withEileen Atkins  Playing Sandwiches, withDavid Haig  The Outside Dog, withJulie Walters  Nights in the Gardens of Spain, with Penelope Wilton  Waiting for the Telegram, with Thora Hird.
