                "Twenty minutes a day with God can change everything. Through focused alone time and question-driven journaling, Terri Savelle Foy will guide readers to discover how God has equipped them for purpose, hope, and success.   \"It's not one two-hour workout that shapes your body, it's twenty minutes of exercise daily.\" In The Alone Advantage, Terri Savelle Foy will show readers how a simple twenty-minute habit of listening to God can shape an entire life. Through practical steps and biblical truths, Terri will guide readers into action and help them learn the habits of successful people and how to do everything from cleaning up to waking up and writing their goals to becoming their own cheerleader in life.  Terri knows what it's like to live in a rut with no vision or goals for her life. For eleven years she existed on autopilot, repeating the same routine with no significant progress. Then she started carving out alone time, picked up a journal, and saw her life transform by applying the ten things successful people do behind closed doors. Now, Terri will prove how the greatest ideas can come in seclusion, strength will be found in solitude, and purpose will be discovered in privacy when nobody is around. Readers will  learn how to achieve success by starting with alone time, writing big questions to God;  discover why and how seclusion, even for just twenty minutes, yields great insight; and  understand the power of imagination to visualize and record dreams for the future.     The Alone Advantage reveals the five reasons successful people journal and how to mold a big dream into a daily to-do list that will inspire action. The key is a blank sheet of paper, time alone with God, and seeking his plan for your life. Through recording God's revelations and learning to listen, readers will see their doubts and anxiety about the future turn into hope and confidence! God has equipped each person with a unique passion, talent, and vision\u2014all it takes to put those in motion is twenty minutes of daily alone time with him. "

In a world filled with more resources for time management and work-life balance than ever before, many of us still find productivity and equilibrium just out of reach. That's because productivity and time management products focus on individual habits rather than lifestyle changes, fixating on small pieces of a larger puzzle. Separately, each piece is useful, but if they're not integrated, we're left feeling frustrated, falling short of our full potential. Instead, we can take inspiration from how the author of time\u2014God\u2014managed his time when he came to Earth in the person of Jesus Christ and faced many of the same human constraints we face today.  In  Redeeming Your Time , Raynor guides readers through seven principles and their corresponding practices to develop a holistic operating system for life. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Start with the Word:  Find meaningful connection with the author of time daily \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Let Your Yes Be Yes:  Accept only the commitments you can fulfill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Dissent from the Kingdom of Noise:  Create room for silence, stillness, and reflection \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Decide What Matters:  Confidently prioritize your commitments \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Accept Your Unipresence:  Focus on one important thing at a time \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Embrace Productive Rest:  Live the God-designed rhythms of rest which are productive for our goals and souls \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Eliminate All Hurry:  Embrace productive busyness while ruthlessly eliminating hurry from our lives\u00a0 By embracing this dynamic integration of life management practices and Jesus\u2019s teachings, readers will be focused, productive, and intentional\u2014fully equipped to do their most exceptional work for glory of God and the good of others.

But such success is super rare and not always how it plays out for great leaders. \u00a0 The reality is that most leaders are responsible for corporations, teams, and products they didn\u2019t launch from the ground up. Tyler Reagin saw the immense need to address this mission-critical but often overlooked aspect of leadership: healthy transition for leaders who inherit teams, places, or platforms others created. \u00a0 His groundbreaking book  Leading Things You Didn\u2019t Start  provides a faith-based four-step plan that answers practical questions such as: \u2022 Do I really want to take over something loved by so many? \u2022 Is there a secret sauce to doing what the leaders before me did? \u2022 How do I get the current team on board with my leadership? \u2022 How do I honor the past without being trapped by it? \u2022 How do I steward the legacy of the leaders who started the movement? Through the use of tried-and-true coaching principles and practical case studies with leaders like Buzz Williams, head coach at Texas A&M, and Cheryl Bachelder, former CEO of Popeyes, Reagin helps you maximize your newfound influx of influence and master the intentions of an inheriting leader.

The entrepreneur, thought leader, and best-selling author of  Called to Create  offers a refreshing invitation: stop trying to do it all so you can thrive in your unique, God-given work.      \"A compelling case for embracing our vocational limits and choosing to do our one thing well.\"\u2014Emily P. Freeman,  Wall Street Journal  best-selling author of  The Next Right Thing      Imagine how different your life would be if you spent your time doing the very thing that brings you the greatest joy. It's possible, but most people spend their days making minimal progress on multiple tasks competent at many things but exceptional at none. That's because for too long we've believed the lie that more activity, more jobs, and more responsibility equals greater effectiveness. In short, we are becoming a society of \"jacks-and-jills-of-all-trades and masters of none.\"    But what if you could shift your focus from too many things to one?    In this thought-provoking book, you'll discover the exponential power of pursuing a singular craft. Through practical principles, Jordan Raynor provides straightforward steps for finding and thriving in your calling.He also highlights more than a dozen real-life examples of high-impact individuals who have chosen to focus on and excel in their unique gifting, including:    \u2022  Chronicles of Narnia  author C. S. Lewis  Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins  TV legend Mister Rogers  Dallas Mavericks CEO Cynthia Marshall  Reality TV star Chip Gaines  NFL Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy  Biblical figures, a teacher, a pilot, a banker, and world-class entrepreneurs    Too many of us are overwhelmed, overcommitted, and overstressed. This book offers a better way\u2014the path to becoming a master of one!. "
