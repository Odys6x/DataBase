                "In Playing Cowboys, Robert Murray Davis examines the Western hero--a principal image of American manhood since publication of The Virginian--as portrayed by a variety of post-World War II novelists and filmmakers. Innovative artists have used the Western to discuss issues of ethics and aesthetics, but its greatest impact may have been on popular cultural values. Davis shows that the Western is not primarily about escape or violence, but, at its best, is about development. The would-be hero adopts the existing role only to find it inadequate, and, forced to \"reimagine\" himself, he defines the Western hero anew. At the core of this process is strength--not power over others, but courage to go beyond the established boundaries. Although women do appear in the Western (often as proponents of \"civilization\"), it is fundamentally a man's world, offering an important view of male identity. Focusing on The Virginian, chapter 1 explores the origin of the Western hero and the source of the genre's major plots and issues. Chapter 2 evaluates history, myth, and the relative reality of the two in the works of Oakley Hall. Citing the novels of Richard Brautigan, E.L. Doctorow, John Hawkes, and Michael Ondaatje, chapter 3 compares the Western and the gothic novel, focusing on the concept of space. These works portray the West as a wasteland devoid of any vitality, but chapter 4 takes up science fiction Westerns (including works by John Jakes, John Boyd, and Robert Sheckley) that use the Western frontier to ironic and liberating effect. Chapter 5, on the motion picture Blazing Saddles and the postmodern Western novels of Ishmael Reed and Alvin Greenberg, examines the role-playing by which identity is created. And in his Preface, Introduction, and Epilogue, Davis frames these discussions with personal observations on the West and its relation to the American masculine mystique. For those interested in Western movies or novels, popular culture, gender studies, or literary criticism, Playing Cowboys is a unique and indispensable guide to the territory from here to the sunset.

It\u2019s the summer of 1964, and recent college graduates Walt Longmire and Henry Standing Bear read the writing on the wall and enlist to serve in the Vietnam War. As they catch a few final waves in California before reporting for duty, a sudden storm assaults the shores and capsizes a nearby cargo boat. Walt and Henry jump to action, but it\u2019s soon revealed by the police who greet them ashore that the sunken boat carried valuable contraband from underground sources. The boys, in their early twenties and in the peak of their physical prowess from playing college football for the last four years, head out on Route 66. The question, of course, is how far they will get before the consequences of their actions catch up to them\u2014the answer being, not very. Back in the present day, Walt is forced to speak before a Judge following the fatal events of  The Longmire Defense . With powerful enemies lurking behind the scenes, the sheriff of Absaroka County must consider his options if he wishes to finish the fight he started. Going back and forth between 1964 and the present day, Craig Johnson brings us a propulsive dual timeline as Walt Longmire stands between the crossfire of good and evil, law and anarchy, and compassion and cruelty at two pivotal stages in his life.

Once, Catriona Macgregor led a charmed life. Daughter of a wealthy rancher, pretty and educated, she looked forward to all the world had to offer\u2014until fate took a turn. Now family, home, and even her name have been stripped away. As \"Black Cat Whitfield,\" adopted daughter of an outlaw, she's wanted by the authorities. It certainly wasn't the destiny she imagined\u2014especially as one of the Blessed.  The Blessed, rare people like Cat, are supposed to use their gifts to carry out missions for the Patron Saints, but she can only imagine that Saint Prudentia made a terrible mistake in choosing her. Still, her gift has never deserted her. Whenever danger threatens, Cat receives a vision\u2014just in time to save her life. And when she meets a renegade priest, Father Ignatius, he helps her understand how her ability may be part of a much bigger picture. A picture that involves facing up to the monstrous Baron Caldwell\u2014the one who ordered her parents killed\u2014and his son, Adrian, who betrayed them all.  Cat is torn between guilt over her parents' deaths, a longing for vengeance against their killers, and a dismaying new interest in Adrian. It would be easiest to flee the whole situation and never look back. But as someone once told her, you can't outrun the darkness on your heels. There's only one way to break through to sunrise\u2014by turning to face the night. "

Wyoming game warden Joe faces two different kinds of rampaging killers   \u2013   one animal, one human   \u2013   in this riveting adventure.  A rogue grizzly bear has gone on a rampage, killing, among others, the prospective fianc\u00e9 of Joe Pickett's daughter.  At the same time, Dallas Cates, who Joe helped lock up, is released from prison with a list of six names tattooed on his skin. He wants revenge on the people who sent him away: the people he blames for the deaths of his entire family and the loss of his reputation and property. Targeted are his lawyer, a judge, the county prosecutor, a prison guard, Joe's associate Nate Romanowski \u2013 and Joe Pickett himself.  Using the grizzly attacks as cover, Cates devises a method of violence identical to the bear killings and sets out to methodically check off his list. Can Joe stop him before he himself becomes the next target on the killer's list?  Reviews for C.J Box  'Box is writing at the top of his game.'   Publishers Weekly   'C. J. Box is among the finest and most literate authors of modern thrillers.'   Bookreporter   'Box's sparse and pragmatic prose is the perfect complement to the wilderness vistas Pickett knows like the back of his hand.'   Providence Journal. "

What Rancho Lindo does have is stable manager T\u00f3mas Ortega, a brooding, handsome cowboy who offers Veronica unsolicited advice during her training sessions. Advice that, infuriatingly, turns out to be right every time.  The only thing T\u00f3mas cares about are his horses and saving his family\u2019s ranch\u2014and not their new boarder, who makes it clear she\u2019s not happy with his stables. So he\u2019s shocked Veronica offers to pretend to be his girlfriend when Tomas\u2019s ex comes back to town. All she wants in return is some after-hours training. He soon realizes Veronica is nothing like he imagined, and the harder he falls, the more he worries, because Veronica\u2019s Olympic dreams will eventually take her away from Rancho Lindo \u2013 and from him.

They see everything as straw dogs.\"     A sweeping historical novel of the American West from the little-seen perspective of those who helped to build it,  Straw Dogs of the Universe  traces the story of one Chinese father and his young daughter, desperate to find him against all odds. After her village is devastated by famine, 10-year-old\u00a0Sixiang is sold to a human trafficker for a bag of rice and six silver coins. Her mother is reluctant to let her go, but the promise of a better life for her beloved daughter ultimately sways her. Arriving in America with the profits from her sale and a single photograph of Guifeng, her absent father, Sixiang journeys across an unfamiliar American landscape in the hopes of reuniting her family.\u00a0 As she makes her way through an unforgiving new world, her father, a railroad worker in California, finds his attempts to build a life for himself both upended and defined by along-lost love and the seemingly inescapable violence of the American West. A generational saga ranging from the villages of China to the establishment of the transcontinental railroad and the anti-Chinese movement in California,  Straw Dogs of the Universe  considers the tenacity of family ties and the courage it takes to survive in a country that rejects you, even as it relies upon your labor.

The chance to be near his young son is the only thing that could entice former SWAT commander Matt Corbin back to his hometown. Matt has only a few happy memories of his tough childhood in Last Ride, Texas, and most of them involve Emory Parkman. Once his teenage crush, she's now living in a cottage on his late grandfather's ranch, which seems like a good omen...until Matt learns Emory is looking into his family's history, a subject he'd prefer remained closed. Emory's wedding-gown designs are said to bring luck\u2014to everyone but her. Though twice bitten by romance that went sour, she's tempted to take a chance on the rancher next door. Emory and Matt's long-ago attempts at love never got a fair chance, but all these years later, their attraction is stronger than ever. Maybe by unearthing some of his ancestors' long-buried secrets, she can help him finally cast off the past's shadows and prove to Matt that the third time's the charm.

Union soldier John Chenneville suffered a traumatic head wound in battle. His recovery took the better part of a year as he struggled to regain his senses and mobility. By the time he returned home, the Civil War was over, but tragedy awaited. John's beloved sister and her family had been brutally murdered.  Their killer goes by many names. He fought for the North in the late unpleasantness, and wore a badge in the name of the law. But the man John knows as A. J. Dodd is little more than a rabid animal, slaughtering without reason or remorse, needing to be put down.  Traveling through the unforgiving landscape of a shattered nation in the midst of Reconstruction, John braves winter storms and confronts desperate people in pursuit of his quarry. Untethered, single-minded in purpose, he will not be deterred. Not by the U.S. Marshal who threatens to arrest him for murder should he succeed. And not by Victoria Reavis, the telegraphist aiding him in his death-driven quest, yet hoping he'll choose to embrace a life with her instead.   And as he trails Dodd deep into Texas, John accepts that this final reckoning between them may cost him more than all he's already lost... "

So he'll be danged when his dreams of permanently avoiding the bounty hunter on his tail in Desolation, the only town where notorious men like him can find respite, comes with one helluva string attached. The town has a new rule: gunslingers welcome\u2014if they get a job...or marry. Without realizing it, Adam stumbles into a big town wedding and accidentally marries Nora Schumacher, a sassy-mouthed mountain of a woman with legs as long as his wanted poster. So what's a gunslinger to do but get himself  unhitched  and find a job. Any job. Except Adam keeps getting fired, one odd circumstance after another. And he's running out of options. Desolation was supposed to be his safe haven. Except, he's not only running from his past but from the irresistible woman he married. And worse, he's finding that he rather likes the enticing, if damnably independent, wife of his. But some men just aren't the marrying kind. Only, if he leaves, his own life won't be worth living. If he stays, he puts the lives of his newfound family and the woman he loves on the line. So much for Desolation being the answer to all his problems.  Each book in the Gunslinger series is STANDALONE: * Hitched To The Gunslinger * The Gunslinger's Guide to Avoiding Matrimony. "

Her bickering with the big, rugged cowboy has become legendary around their small Montana town. But little does anyone know, Charlotte's animosity masks unspoken feelings... because underneath it all, Chance is the only man who ever truly claimed her heart.   Chance has spent his whole life in Rustlers Creek, but he's always been on the outside looking in. He needs to focus on keeping his ranch afloat amid the massive debt left by his late father, and the feelings he harbors for Charlotte don't make it any easier. She's ranching royalty and he's perpetually scrubbing mud off his boots. It's safer to push her away than hope for something he can never have.  When a business opportunity forces Charlotte and Chance to work together, they share a heated moment in each other's arms. The simmering attraction they've fought for years can no longer be ignored, but will Chance's doubts stand in the way of their happiness? Or will he finally declare his love and prove to Charlotte that he's always been her cowboy?. "

Highly recommended!\"\u2014  Paulette Jiles,  New York Times  bestselling author of  News of the World    Beautifully rendered,  Where Coyotes Howl  is a vivid and deeply affecting ode to the early twentieth century West, from master storyteller Sandra Dallas.   Except for the way they loved each other, they were just ordinary, everyday folks. Just ordinary.  1916. The two-street town of Wallace is not exactly what Ellen Webster had in mind when she accepted a teaching position in Wyoming, but within a year's time she's fallen in love\u2014both with the High Plains and with a handsome cowboy named Charlie Bacon. Life is not easy in the flat, brown corner of the state where winter blizzards are unforgiving and the summer heat relentless. But Ellen and Charlie face it all together, their relationship growing stronger with each shared success, and each deeply felt tragedy.  Ellen finds purpose in her work as a rancher's wife and in her bonds with other women settled on the prairie. Not all of them are so lucky as to have loving husbands, not all came to Wallace willingly, and not all of them can survive the cruel seasons. But they look out for each other, share their secrets, and help one another in times of need. And the needs are great and constant. The only city to speak of, Cheyenne, is miles away, making it akin to the Wild West in rural Wallace. In the end, it is not the trials Ellen and Charlie face together that make them remarkable, but their love for one another that endures through it all. "

He just prayed he'd be in time to save the man who had raised him as a son  and  keep his best friend from the gallows. He knew he'd encounter rustlers, scoundrels and thieves, but he'd never expected to find a woman like Lorelei Fellows.  Setting fire to her wedding dress in the town square probably wasn't the best way to stand her ground. But Lorelei had had enough. She was sick of men and their schemes. All she wanted was to stake her claim on her own little piece of Texas. And with Holt McKettrick as a neighbor, things were beginning to look up. The man was a straight shooter with a strong will, a steady aim and a hungry heart. "

                "From the author of the New York Times bestseller Everybody Rise, a rich and riveting novel with the exquisite historical detail and evocative settings of The Cold Millions and Great Circle that tells the story of one unforgettable woman's rise in country and western music.   It's 1980, and Lillian Waters is hitting the road for the very last time.  Jaded from her years in the music business, perpetually hungover, and diagnosed with career-ending vocal problems, Lillian cobbles together a nationwide farewell tour featuring some old hands from her early days playing honky-tonk bars in Washington State and Nashville, plus a few new ones. She yearns to feel the rush of making live music one more time and bask in the glow of a packed house before she makes the last, and most important, stop on the tour: the farm she left behind at age ten and the sister she is finally ready to confront about an agonizing betrayal in their childhood.  As the novel crisscrosses eras, moving between Lillian's youth\u2014the Depression, the Second World War, the rise of Nashville\u2014and her middle-aged life in 1980, we see her striving to build a career in the male-dominated world of country music, including the hard choices she makes as she tries to redefine music, love, aging, and womanhood on her own terms.  Nearing her final tour stop, Lil is forced to confront those choices and how they shaped her life. Would a different version of herself have found the happiness and success that has eluded her? When she reaches her Washington hometown for her very last show, though, she'll undergo a reckoning with the past that forces her to reconsider her entire life story.  Exploring one unforgettable woman's creativity, ambition, and sacrifices in a world\u2014and an art form\u2014made for men, The Farewell Tour asks us to consider how much of our past we can ever leave behind.

Distraught and desperate for revenge, the young men set out in search of the killers. But the year is 1885, and the only man who can help them is the cunning and ruthless John Sullivan \u2013 wealthy landowner and their father's former employer.  Rallying a posse of men, Sullivan defers to the deadly Inspector Noone and his Queensland Native Police - an infamous arm of colonial power whose sole purpose is the 'dispersal' of Indigenous Australians in 'protection' of settler rights. The retribution that follows will leave a lasting scar on the colony and the country it later becomes. It will also haunt Tommy for the rest of his life.  Set against Australia's stunningly harsh landscapes, Only Killers and Thieves is a compelling, devastating novel about cruelty and survival, injustice and honour - and about two brothers united in grief, then forever torn apart.   Paul Howarth  was born and grew up in the UK before moving to Melbourne in his late twenties. He lived in Australia for over six years, gained dual-citizenship in 2012, and now lives in Norwich with his family. He graduated from the UEA Creative Writing MA in 2015 and was awarded the Malcolm Bradbury Scholarship. Only Killers and Thieves is his first novel. "

In Ransom's own words all he has to do is: \"Kill Rafael, steal the gold from armed vaqueros in a foreign country and get it back to Texas through Comanche and bandit country without getting my ass shot off. Then I have to convince Anson Jones that I was on assignment for you when I stole the gold. Sounds like a crappy deal, General, especially if something happens to you while I'm gone.\" Ransom accepts the assignment in order to settle a vendetta with bandit leader Rafael and enlists the aid of notorious mountain man and cutthroat, Patch Wilkes as his only dubious ally. Along the way Ransom must deal with a belligerent Mexican aristocrat, treacherous Comanche warriors, a gang of banditos, kidnapping, double-cross, hardship, and murder. Violence and deception pursue Ransom as he pursues his only goal: kill Rafael. One disclosure follows another in this violent tale of the early days of the Texas Republic.

                "US Deputy Marshal Don Lovell works the Indian Territory \"on the scout\" out of Fort Smith, Arkansas, in 1878. He is known for a strong handshake and a firm disposition, and for making good his word. Women generally find him ominous and aloof, yet a few know better. What makes the difference is impossible to predict and, for the most part, a woman who doesn't know his character is intimidated. He has that effect upon many people\u2014men and women alike. In any company Lovell is always the lone wolf, separate and quiet about his own affairs. No one knows all there is to know about him. He keeps his distance to preserve a measure of anonymity, which is his chief measure of security. In   Lovell's Prize   Don Lovell follows trails of rape, torture, shooting, and death. He runs every risk to carry out his mission of taking the law to a lawless land.   Lovell's Prize   is a thrilling tale of action set in the savage reality, not the misty romance, of the nineteenth-century American West, where all prizes are won at dire human cost.  BOSON BOOKS  offers several westerns and nonfiction works by Randy Smith. For an author bio, photo, and a sample read visit bosonbooks.com. "

                "The writing of John Fox, Jr. has had profound significance in the way America studies turn-of-the-century Appalachian mountain life, lending fondness for its customs, respect for its survival, and deep regard for its environmental and psychological altercations. \"Knight of the Cumberland\" gives a narrative and a vivid setting for these sentiments. The story is told by a writer who is the son of a moonshiner. He has moved to the city to contend with a more civilized existence, but he comes back to The Gap (Big Stone Gap, VA) every summer. This summer he brings along his little sister and a womanish, black-haired, black-eyed beauty that townspeople and mountainfolk perversely call \"The Blight.\" And yet no man nor woman nor stubborn mule could withstand her undefinable appeal. The boy and two girls travel from the north by train and arrive in town where they meet the Hon. Samuel Budd who is involved with the budding politics of this new district, Marston who engineered the train, and a drunken young tough who tries to attack Marston for a timeless injustice. There is an immediate trial where the young man is fined and told to leave town. He does, but his vision of The Blight wins his attention. The three travelers continue on their way up the mountain (silently protected by The Knight) because the boy had promised to show The Blight the blossoming, fragrant, Applachian summer. Before winter hits, the girls are sent back up north, but they revisit the next summer where there is an uncommon incorporation of tournament, duel, and stump-speaking. Fox attempts to illustrate the ways people of the wilderness struggled\u2014sometimes unsuccessfully\u2014with the patronizing socialites. The character of Marston the engineer and The Wild Dog, who is also The Knight, blends the civilizing effects of steady work and the emotional attraction of magnificence, whether by scenic beauty or human elegance.

                "Dodge City   is the second of three historical novels depicting the life of fictional plains adventurer, Lane Collier. This time Collier is a professional bison hunter during the great Southern herd slaughter of the early 1870s. He has formed a successful partnership with Abraham Marmaduke McKnight, a wildly notorious thumper, gambler, and whoremonger. In spite of his lack of civility, McKnight is also a loyal, honest, and dedicated friend. The men set off on one last hunt south of the \"Dead Line\" into hostile Indian country to pursue the last remnants of the great herd. Although the legendary frontier settlement of Dodge City is most closely associated with Texas cattle drives of the 1880s, its founding was as a center of the buffalo hide trade.   Dodge City   takes the reader on a historically accurate professional hide hunt describing the trade and dangers associated with chasing \"spikes.\" The book also presents the romance and mystery of the open plains before white settlement. Collier again takes up his legendary Remington Rolling Block rifle as he ventures into the Llano Estacado region of West Texas. Not only does he encounter the buffalo, but also an old antagonist attempting to drive him from the last remainder of the Indian Southern hunting grounds. He is also embroiled in the discovery of Spanish Canyon, the renowned site of Coronado's hidden treasure. Plenty of action, adventure, and history await in Dodge City. Join the second of a series that enjoys national serialization in  SHOOT!  magazine, a chronicle for Old West and living history enthusiasts.  BOSON BOOKS offers several westerns and nonfiction works by Randy D. Smith. For an author bio and photo, reviews and a reading sample, visit bosonbooks.com. "

                "The Stetsons and the Lewallens had come to the Cumberland as friends but lived as enemies for almost fifty years. After the Civil War they were still neighbors and still irascible foes. The war had supplied them both with defenses which demonstrated an hereditary loathing for human life and an appetite for unrestraint. Even though peace had been tolerated for many years, one day, in an ambush, Old Jasper Lewallen killed Rome Stetson's father. Rome's Uncle Rufe escaped to the West, and the Stetsons had no leader. There was no news of Rufe for three years until suddenly he returned to town and opened a shop in the county-seat of Hazlan, on the opposite end of the street where Old Jasper had a store. The tension in Hazlan ran high, and Rufe was warned not to appear outside his door after dark. Young Jasper attended to this edict. However, his sister, Martha would take some corn to be ground at the mill on Stetson's side of the river, a mill operated by Old Gabe Bunch. Rome saw her there as he visited the mill one night, and memories of meeting her years ago flooded back. Rome learned of her history from Old Gabe, and he also formed his own impressions after noting her strong arms, the native dignity in the pose of her head, her deep eyes, her graceful movements. The motive for his opposition to the Lewallens had disappeared. He decided that her plucky spirit prompted his own craving for defiance. The high-strung situation continued until Rome met Young Jasper on a mountain ledge where Rome offered an end to the unyielding conflict. Finally, with the deaths of Old Jasper and Rufe, blame was questionable and any justice uncertain. Rome, after a spring season spent hiding from the soldiers sent to capture him for the recent deaths, was at last able to meet Martha and tell her the true occurrence on the mountain ledge. He asked her to run away with him to another jurisdiction where he was not a wanted man. Their mutual decision made the end to the generations-long feud complete and irrefutable. "

He comes to the Valley of Kingdom Come, and his noble resolve and conspicuous poverty appeals to the childless Major Buford. When the Major learns that Chad is a distant relative, he introduces the boy to the Southern aristocracy and becomes his mentor. Chad takes the notice of Southern belle Margaret Dean, but as gossip of his illegitimacy arises, Chad returns to the hills through the unselfish work of a mountain girl, Melissa Turner, who loves Chad and forsakes her love for his peace. The rumors are untrue, and he is absolved of accountability for deceit. He returns to Lexington, and the Civil War breaks out. Most of his friends and neighbors (the Bufords and the Deans) join the Confederacy while Chad and Harry Dean join with Union forces. Dan Dean is captured and sentenced to death while Chad's military squad is sent to investigate the Dean's house. Dan's life is redeemed when Chad argues the authorities in Dan's defense. Margaret accommodates the quarreling blue and grey forces by directly presenting their contentious disagreements for review. Melissa, meanwhile, goes back to the mountains, satisfied that Chad is happy. \"Once again he was starting life over afresh, with his old capital, a strong body and a stout heart.\" "

                "\"A journey well worth taking.\"   -Abby Jimenez,  New York Times  bestselling author  The  New York Times  bestselling author delivers an emotional, intimate work of women's fiction centered on a young widow, and filled with reflections on love, loss, and finding hope, and even joy, after heartache-for fans of Josie Silver, Sophie Cousens, and Rebecca Serle.     No marriage is perfect, but in Rachel Ackermann's eyes, hers came close. From the very start, her love story with Josh was wonderful. There's just one problem with stories: no matter how great the beginning, there's also an ending. For Rachel and Josh, it comes suddenly and far too soon.    Trying to move on without Josh feels impossible, and it's tempting for Rachel to cocoon in the dark with the reminders of the life they should have shared. But her quirky, sometimes exasperating family won't let that happen. And as Rachel is nudged back into the sunlight, she uncovers a trove of surprising secrets-and an opportunity to save a family legacy-and maybe save herself in the process . . .  But it will mean forging an unexpected alliance with her late father's unpopular young \"trophy wife.\" And then there's Rache's renewed bond with Campbell Scott, the boy who another lifetime ago broke her heart. Just when Rachel thinks she's got everything figured out, she learns that in between beginnings and endings lie new chapters . . .  \"Through a heartbreaking exploration of love, loss, and grief, Finz weaves together a beautiful story of healing, hope, and unexpected second chances.\"  -Amy Pine,  USA Today  bestselling author.

Yet when a relieved Jen finally tracks down her son, Noah realizes the story is more complicated than he thought. And soon, so are his feelings for Jen . . .

This sexy cowboy is nothing but a complication...but he\u2019s also impossible to resist.  \u00a0  As the new horticulturist at Rancho Lindo, Nora Torres is determined to make the garden a success and prove to the Ortega family that they made the right decision in hiring her. Plants take patience and care, and that should be Nora\u2019s focus, not Gabe Ortega, who is back home on his family\u2019s ranch after an injury abruptly ended his military career. A long time ago, Nora made the mistake of believing a promise from Gabe, and she\u2019s determined not to make that mistake twice.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His family hopes he\u2019s home for good, but Gabe has always wanted something else\u2014something more\u2014than working at Rancho Lindo. So he can\u2019t allow himself to be sidetracked by his feelings for Nora when he knows he\u2019ll be leaving again. But soon, rather than keeping his distance from the garden and the talented horticulturist, Gabe finds what he really wants is to change Nora\u2019s mind about him. "

Harper Allen has returned to Rustlers Creek but she's not the heartbroken girl who left. After a successful career in Seattle, she's back in her hometown to launch her coffee business with the help of her celebrity sister, the Cowgirl Gourmet. But Harper can't escape handsome veterinarian Gray McClain, the man who broke her heart ten years ago and whose kisses still make her head spin.  Although Gray believed he knew what he was doing when he ended things with Harper, seeing her has made him question everything. He wanted more for her than a life with the son of a town drunk, but every moment with her is heaven. When a freak ranch accident causes Gray to lose some of his memory, he believes he's spent the last decade with Harper, the woman he's never stopped loving, instead of alone.  As Harper helps Gray return to health, she can't deny she's more in love with him than ever. But can she fight for the man of her dreams, even when he's determined to let her go again? When it comes to choosing to forget or choosing to remember, Harper must show Gray she'll always remember her cowboy. "

In a future ravaged by fire and drought, two climate refugees ride their motorcycles across the wasteland of the western US, and stumble upon an old silver mine. Descending into the cool darkness of the caved-in tunnels in desperate search of water, the two women find Lavinia Cain's diary, a settler in search of prosperity who brought her family to Nevada in the late 1860s.  But Lavinia and the settlers of the Western town discovered something monstrous that dwells in the depths of the mine, something that does not want greedy prospectors disturbing the earth. Whispers of curses and phantom figures haunt the diary, and now, over 150 years later, trapped and injured in the abandoned mine, the women discover they're not alone . . . with no easy way out.  The monsters are still here\u2014and they're thirsty. "

What if the only way you know who you are is because your name is printed in the leather sweatband of your cowboy hat, and what if it says your name is Walt Longmire . . . but you don\u2019t remember him? In  Hell and Back , the eighteenth installment of the Longmire series, author Craig Johnson takes the beloved sheriff to the very limits of his sanity to do battle with the most dangerous adversary he\u2019s ever faced: himself.
