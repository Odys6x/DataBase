They are wide-ranging in coverage, focusing on financial crises, reserve accumulation, capital flows and currency wars, on the one hand, and issues relating to foreign direct investment and developments in China and India, on the other. It is written in a manner that makes it accessible to students as well as policy-makers, practitioners and interested observers. "

It presents a comparison of financing patterns in developed and developing countries, identifying similarities and differences across firms. Particular questions of interest are: How do corporations in developing countries finance growth? To what extent do these corporations resort to external finance? Does loan finance dominate other types of external finance? How different are financing patterns in developed and developing countries? As a second objective, the paper looks more closely at patterns within developing countries themselves. The questions of interest are: How similar are corporate capital structures in fast growing countries to those in more slowly growing countries? What is the relationship between firm size and corporate financial patterns? What is the relationship between corporate growth and corporate financing patterns? Do companies which grow faster retain a greater proportion of their profits? One issue of particular interest to IFC is whether capital structures and financial profiles of corporations supported by IFC in various developing countries are similar to those of other comparable companies.

                "A Primer on Securitization introduces readers to America's newest system of raising capital: what it is, how it operates, and what difference securitization makes. Gathering fourteen lectures by the pioneers of securitization and by current practitioners--from Freddie Mac, Paine Webber, JP Morgan, Chrysler, McKinsey & Co, and other major players--A Primer on Securitization introduces readers to America's newest system of raising capital: what it is, how it operates, and what difference securitization makes. The securitization process bypasses financial intermediaries that have historically collected deposits and loaned them to those seeking funds, and links borrowers directly to money and capital markets. Although little has been written about what is perhaps one of the most important innovations to emerge in financial markets since the 1930s, securitization has revolutionized the way that the borrowing needs of consumers and businesses are met. Today, for example, over two-thirds of all home loans are being securitized, along with substantial percentages of auto loans and credit card receivables, and the process continues to expand into new fields including synthetic securities. Authoritative and practical, these lectures show how securitization was developed to fill a gap in financial markets. They discuss the nature and causes of the market imperfections that made securitization a valuable source of funds, and describe how securitization has linked local mortgage markets with international capital markets. Readers will gain a broad perspective of the different parties--the borrower, the loan originator, the servicer, the rating agency, the special purpose vehicle, the credit enhancer, the underwriter, and the investor--as well as a detailed analysis of how these parties relate to one another. From the inception of the secondary mortgage market through the collapse of the Granite funds, readers will learn not only about the success but also about the excesses and failures that typically accompany the development of any product in the real or financial sector.
