                "MOST ANTICIPATED READS OF 2023: ELLE   The Millions   Essence / BEST SUMMER READS OF 2023: New York Times Book Review   USA Today   The Skimm   Bookpage   St Louis Post-Dispatch    \"Aisha Harris is one of our smartest, most entertaining modern cultural critics. The nine pieces offer insight on Stevie Wonder, the Spice Girls, Pen15, and New Girl\u2014among many other pop artifacts, of course\u2014which might as well be parlance for, 'Read me immediately.'\"     \u2014ELLE   Aisha Harris has made a name for herself as someone you can turn to   for a razor-sharp take on whatever show or movie everyone   is talking about. Now, she turns her talents inward, mining the benchmarks of her nineties childhood and beyond to analyze the tropes that are shaping all of us, and our ability to shape them right back.  In the opening essay, an interaction with Chance the Rapper prompts an investigation into the origin myth of her name. Elsewhere, Aisha traces the evolution of the \"Black Friend\" trope from its Twainian origins through to the heyday of the Spice Girls, teen comedies like Clueless, and sitcoms of the New Girl variety. And she examines the overlap of taste and identity in this era, rejecting the patriarchal ethos that you are what you like .  Whatever the subject, sitting down with her book feels like hanging out with your smart, hilarious, pop culture\u2013obsessed friend\u2014and it's a delight. "

                "A sharp-witted and deeply insightful look into the storied world of elite prep schools from the first African-American legacy student to graduate from The Taft School  Early on in Kendra James's professional life, she began to feel like she was selling a lie. As an admissions officer specializing in diversity recruitment for independent prep schools, she persuaded students and families to embark on the same perilous journey she herself had made\u2014to attend cutthroat and largely white schools similar to The Taft School, where she had been the first African-American legacy student only a few years earlier. Her new job forced her to reflect on her own elite education experience and to realize how disillusioned she had become with America's inequitable system.  In Admissions, James looks back at the three years she spent at Taft, chronicling clashes with her white roommate, how she had to unlearn the respectability politics she had been raised with, and the fall-out from a horrifying article in the student newspaper that accused Black and Latinx students of being responsible for segregation of campus. Through these stories, some troubling, others hilarious, she deconstructs the lies and half-truths she herself would later tell as an admissions professional, in addition to the myths about boarding schools perpetuated by popular culture.  With its combination of incisive social critique and uproarious depictions of elite nonsense, Admissions will resonate with anyone who has ever been \"the only one\" in a room, dealt with racial microaggressions, or even just suffered from an extreme case of homesickness.

                "As a 6'2\" dreadlocked black man, Tyler Merritt knows what it feels like to be stereotyped as threatening, which can have dangerous consequences. But he also knows that proximity to people who are different from ourselves can be a cure for racism.  Tyler Merritt's video \"Before You Call the Cops\" has been viewed millions of times. He's appeared on  Jimmy Kimmel  and  Sports Illustrated  and has been profiled in the  New York Times . The viral video's main point\u2014the more you know someone, the more empathy, understanding, and compassion you have for that person\u2014is the springboard for this book. By sharing his highs and exposing his lows, Tyler welcomes us into his world in order to help bridge the divides that seem to grow wider every day.In  I Take My Coffee Black,  Tyler tells hilarious stories from his own life as a black man in America. He talks about growing up in a multi-cultural community and realizing that he wasn't always welcome, how he quit sports for musical theater (that's where the girls were) to how Jesus barged in uninvited and changed his life forever (it all started with a Triple F.A.T. Goose jacket) to how he ended up at a small Bible college in Santa Cruz because he thought they had a great theater program (they didn't). Throughout his stories, he also seamlessly weaves in lessons about privilege, the legacy of lynching and sharecropping and why you don't cross black mamas. He teaches readers about the history of encoded racism that still undergirds our society today.By turns witty, insightful, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny,  I Take My Coffee Black  paints a portrait of black manhood in America and enlightens, illuminates, and entertains\u2014ultimately building the kind of empathy that might just be the antidote against the racial injustice in our society.

If you've watched television or movies in the past year, you've seen Michelle Buteau. With scene-stealing roles in  Always Be My Maybe ,  First Wives Club ,  Someone Great ,  Russian Doll , and  Tales of the City ; a reality TV show and breakthrough stand-up specials, including her headlining show  Welcome to   Buteaupia  on Netflix, and two podcasts ( Late Night Whenever  and  Adulting ), Michelle's star is on the rise. You'd be forgiven for thinking the road to success\u2014or adulthood or financial stability or self-acceptance or marriage or motherhood\u2014has been easy; but you'd be wrong.    Now, in  Survival of the Thickest , Michelle reflects on growing up Caribbean, Catholic, and thick in New Jersey, going to college in Miami (where everyone smells like pineapple), her many friendship and dating disasters, working as a newsroom editor during 9/11, getting started in standup opening for male strippers, marrying into her husband's Dutch family, IVF and surrogacy, motherhood, chosen family, and what it feels like to have a full heart, tight jeans, and stardom finally in her grasp.

                "As urgent, resonant, and essential as The Fire Next Time and Between the World and Me, a poetic, raw, and inspirational love letter from the bestselling author of Buck, written to a nephew who was shot nine times and survived\u2014a reflection on life, overcoming odds, finding your voice, and the power of music and family.   Waiting in the emergency room at Temple University Hospital in North Philadelphia where his eighteen-year-old nephew, Nasir, lay unconscious after being shot nine times, MK Asante began pouring his heart and soul into a series of letters to a beautiful, dying Black boy so full of life.  As Nasir fought for survival, MK realized there was so much\u2014too much\u2014that he had kept from his nephew, starting with the truth about his father, MK's brother, Uzi, whom Nasir had never met. MK could no longer remain silent because in many ways, his nephew was repeating the mistakes of the past. MK began his confessional to repair family bonds\u2014to save Nasir from the same streets that stole his father and to introduce him to the man and family history the young man had never known. The result is this beautiful, poignant, and honest family memoir.  Nephew introduces us to two men, strangers to each other, whose similarities are astonishing. Both have red hot tempers, both struggle with opioid addiction, and most profoundly, both are lyrical geniuses whose raps are raw, powerful, and autobiographical. Yet neither had ever heard the other's lyrics. As he tells his family's story, MK draws vivid portraits of both Nasir and Uzi through their songs\u2014lyrics that become the touchstone of their relationship. When father and son eventually meet, they confront each other and share a dialogue through their lyrics.  An explosive, innovative memoir of family, faith, poetry, secrets, love, race, poverty, redemption, addiction, Philadelphia, hip-hop, jail, purpose, mental health, and violence. Nephew is fast-paced, intimate, lyrical, educational, and inspirational. It is the epic, painful, poetic, and miraculous redemptive story of a new generation\u2014a new style of memoir for a new decade, the rhythmic story of a family in love, struggle, and verse. "

Evers, with Myrlie as his partner in activism and in life, was doing civil rights work in the single most hostile and dangerous environment in America.\"\u2014from Medgar and Myrlie    By MSNBC's Joy-Ann Reid, a triumphant work of biography that repositions slain Civil Rights pioneer Medgar Evers at the heart of America's struggle for freedom, and celebrates Myrlie Evers's extraordinary activism after her husband's assassination in the driveway of their Mississippi home.    \"\"I love this book. The empathic, brilliant, and wise Joy Reid has brought us the poignant, fascinating inside story of Medgar and Myrlie Evers, transformational leaders who confronted pure evil and risked their lives to ensure that all American children might grow up in a United States that was more just. As Reid shows us, that painful task is now more urgent than ever.\" \u2014 Michael Beschloss   Myrlie Louise Beasley met Medgar Evers on her first day of college. They fell in love at first sight, married just one year later, and Myrlie left school to focus on their growing family.  Medgar became the field secretary for the Mississippi branch of the NAACP, charged with beating back the most intractable and violent resistance to black voting rights in the country. Myrlie served as Medgar's secretary and confidant, working hand in hand with him as they struggled against public accommodations and school segregation, lynching, violence, and sheer despair within their state's \"black belt.\" They fought to desegregate the intractable University of Mississippi, organized picket lines and boycotts, despite repeated terroristic threats, including the 1962 firebombing of their home, where they lived with their three young children.  On June 12, 1963, Medgar Evers became the highest profile victim of Klan-related assassination of a black civil rights leader at that time; gunned down in the couple's driveway in Jackson. In the wake of his tragic death, Myrlie carried on their civil rights legacy; writing a book about Medgar's fight, trying to win a congressional seat, and becoming a leader of the NAACP in her own right.  In this groundbreaking and thrilling account of two heroes of the civil rights movement, Joy-Ann Reid uses Medgar and Myrlie's relationship as a lens through which to explore the on-the-ground work that went into winning basic rights for Black Americans, and the repercussions that still resonate today.

This is the story of how I became an unapologetic Black disabled woman in a white world. This book is for people who look and live structurally like me to be valued, seen, heard and perhaps some advice on how to navigate life amongst white supremacy. This book is also for white people who have been \"doing the work\" since the murder of George Floyd to read my story and be able to clearly see systemic oppression, racism, and ableism. There are books sharing the historical context of white supremacy, providing tips on how to be an ally or anti-racist, and firsthand experiences from Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) which are important. I push the conversation that leads to real change through my story. This book is for the Black woman who is looking to been seen and soft in shared lived experience. It is for the white person who is immersing themselves in the community they want to advocate for. It is for anyone who understands that learning and unlearning is lifelong.     White Supremacy Is All Around  arrives as the U.S.'s ongoing racial reckoning has left readers searching for voices they can trust. BIPOC, disabled people, and other intentionally ignored Americans want to feel heard and empowered; organization leaders and allies invested in dismantling white supremacy want a framework for how best to contribute. Dr. Akilah Cadet speaks to all these needs, drawing from her life experiences and work helping leading brands build inclusive and equitable cultures to offer an informed perspective that prioritizes belonging. In a series of personal stories told with her trademark candor and wit, Dr. Cadet explores the long-term work required to combat structural oppression from her unique vantage point as a Black disabled woman. She tackles everything: from the 2020 \"summer of allyship \"  and depression caused by workplace discrimination to navigating disability and building a consulting business, all with a little inspo from Beyonc\u00e9.    A powerful call for true accompliceship for non-Black people, and a way for Black people to see and celebrate themselves,  White Supremacy Is All Around  ushers in a new voice that is timely, urgent, and essential\u2014and a vision we all need now.

                "The debut memoir from award-winning journalist Morgan Campbell: an incredible history of a family\u2019s battles across generations, a hilarious and emotional coming-of-age story, and a powerful reckoning with what it means to be Black in Canada\u2014particularly when you have strong American roots.  Morgan Campbell comes from \u201ca fighting family,\u201d a connection and clash that reaches back to the south side of Chicago in the 1930s. His father\u2019s and mother\u2019s families were both part of the Great Migration from the U.S. rural south to the industrial north, but a history of perceived slights and social-class differences solidified a great feud that only intensified over the course of the century after the families came together in marriage and split up across the border. Morgan\u2019s maternal grandfather, Claude Jones\u2014a legendary grudge-holder, as well was an accomplished musician, peer of Oscar Peterson, and fixture of the Chicago jazz scene\u2014was recruited to play some shows in Toronto, fell in love with the city, and eventually settled in Canada in the mid-1960s, paving the way for Morgan\u2019s parents to join him amid the tumult of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement. Morgan\u2019s paternal grandmother, Granny Mary, however, remained stateside, a distance her schemes and resentments would only grow to fill.\u00a0 That fighting spirit wasn\u2019t limited to the family\u2019s own squabbles, though\u2014it animated the way every generation moved through the world. From battling back as a group against white supremacist newcomers who violently resisted Black neighbours, to Morgan\u2019s pre-teen mother burnishing her own legend by cold-cocking some racist loudmouth bullies, the lesson was clear: sometimes words weren\u2019t enough. In Canada, the Campbells started a family of their own, but the tensions between in-laws never ceased, even as divorce and disease threatened the very foundations of the life they\u2019d built. Bearing witness to all of this was young Morgan, an aspiring writer, budding star athlete, and slow-jam scholar, whose deep American roots landed him an outsider status that led to its own schoolyard scraps and exposed the profound gap between Canada\u2019s utopian multicultural reputation and the very different reality.\u00a0 Having grown up bouncing between these disparate identities and nationalities, real or imagined\u2014Black and Canadian, Canadian and American, Campbell and Jones\u2014 My Fighting Family  is a witty, wise, rich, and soulful illumination of the journey to find clarity in all that conflict.

In the 1980s, their mother headed an organization of Black women physicians, and for years the girls watched these fiercely intelligent women in white coats tend to their patients and neighbors, host community health fairs, cure ills, and save lives. What Dr. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock did not understand as a child\u2014or learn about at Harvard Medical School, where she and her sister had followed in their mother\u2019s footsteps, making them the first Black mother-daughter legacies from the school\u2014were the profound and long-standing systemic inequities that mean just 2 percent of all U.S. physicians today are Black women; the racist practices and policies that ensure Black Americans have far worse health outcomes than any other group in the country; and the flawed system that endangers the well-being of communities like theirs. As an ER physician, and later as a professor in academic medicine, Dr. Blackstock became profoundly aware of the systemic barriers that Black patients and physicians continue to face.  Legacy    is a journey through the critical intersection of racism and healthcare. At once a searing indictment of our healthcare system, a generational family memoir, and a call to action,  Legacy  is Dr. Blackstock\u2019s odyssey from child to medical student to practicing physician\u2014to finally seizing her own power as a health equity advocate against the backdrop of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.

                "Over the course of more than twenty years, James D. Richardson and his wife, Lori, retraced the steps of his ancestor, George Richardson (1824-1911), across nine states, uncovering letters, diaries, and more memoirs hidden away. Their journey brought them to the brink of the racial divide in America, revealing how his great-great-grandfather Richardson played a role in the Underground Railroad, served as a chaplain to a Black Union regiment in the Civil War, and founded a college in Texas for the formerly enslaved. In narrating this compelling life, The Abolitionist's Journal explores the weight of the past as well as the pull of one's ancestral history. The author raises questions about why this fervent commitment to the emancipation of African Americans was nearly forgotten by his family, exploring the racial attitudes in the author's upbringing and the ingrained racism that still plagues our nation today. As America confronts a generational reckoning on race, these important perspectives add a layer to our larger national story. "

Jodi M. Savage was raised in Brooklyn, New York, by her maternal grandmother. Her whip-smart, charismatic mother struggled with addiction and was unable to care for her. Granny\u2014a fiery Pentecostal preacher who had a way with words\u2014was Jodi's rock, until Alzheimer's disease turned the tables, and a 28-year-old Jodi stepped into the role of caretaker. It was up to Jodi to get them both through the devastations of a deteriorating mind. After Granny passed away, Jodi spent years trying to reckon with her grief. Jodi and her mother were both diagnosed with breast cancer nearly a decade later, and then Jodi lost her too.  In this searing, candid collection of essays, Jodi illuminates the roles that identity and memory play in preserving those we love. Jodi explores the lives of modern Black women and communities through the prism of her personal experiences. With grace, creativity, and insight, she looks at femininity, family, race, mental illness, grief, healthcare, and faith. Jodi deftly portrays how trauma is inherited, and how the struggle to break a generational curse can last a lifetime.  The Death of a Jaybird is a thoughtful examination of complicated family love, loss, and the liberating power of claiming our stories. "

                "A stunning personal manifesto on memory, family, and history that explores how we in America might\u2014together\u2014come to a new view of our shared past   \u201cA vulnerable, honest look at a life lived in a country still struggling with its evils...Hopeful...Beautiful and haunting.\u201d \u2014Eddie S. Glaude Jr., author of    Begin Again   In 2020, heartsick from constant assaults on Black life, Tracy K. Smith found herself soul-searching and digging into the historical archive for help navigating the \u201cdin of human division and strife.\u201d With lyricism and urgency, Smith draws on several avenues of thinking\u2014personal, documentary, and spiritual\u2014to understand who we are as a nation and what we might hope to mean to one another. In Smith\u2019s own words, \u201cTo write a book about Black strength, Black continuance, and the powerful forms of belief and community that have long bolstered the soul of my people, I used the generations of my own patrilineal family to lean backward toward history, to gather a fuller sense of the lives my own ancestors led, the challenges they endured, and the sources of hope and bolstering they counted on. What this process has led me to believe is that all of us, in the here and now, can choose to work alongside the generations that precede us in tending to America\u2019s oldest wounds and meeting the urgencies of our present.\u201d  To Free the Captives  touches down in Sunflower, Alabama, the red-dirt town where Smith\u2019s father\u2019s family comes from, and where her grandfather returned after World War I   with a hero\u2019s record but difficult prospects as a Black man. Smith considers his life and the life of her father through the lens of history. Hoping to connect with their strength and continuance, she assembles a new terminology of American life.\u00a0 Bearing courageous witness to the terms of Freedom afforded her as a Black woman, a mother, and an educator in the twenty-first century,   Smith etches a portrait of where we find ourselves four hundred years into the American experiment. Weaving in an account of her growing spiritual practice, she argues that the soul is not merely a private site of respite or transcendence, but a tool for   fulfilling our duties to each other, and a sounding board for our most pressing collective questions: Where are we going as a nation? Where have we been?. "

                "Pre-order now! The  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Book of Delights  and  Inciting Joy  shares this new chronicle of small, daily wonders\u2014and it is exactly the book we need in these unsettling times.   Ross Gay's essays have been called \"exquisite\" (Tracy K. Smith), \"imperative\" (the  New York Times Book Review ), and \"brilliant\" (Ada Lim\u00f3n). Now, in this new collection of genre-defying pieces, again written over the course of a year, one of America's most original voices continues his ongoing investigation of delight.  For Gay, what delights us is what connects us, what gives us meaning, from the joy of hearing a nostalgic song blasting from a passing car to the pleasure of refusing the \"ubiquitous, nefarious\" scannable QR code menus, from the tiny dog he fell hard for to his mother baking a dozen kinds of cookies for her grandchildren.  As always, Gay revels in the natural world\u2014sweet potatoes being harvested, a hummingbird carousing in the beebalm, a sunflower growing out of a wall around the cemetery, the shared bounty from a neighbor's fig tree\u2014and the trillion mysterious ways this glorious earth delights us.  For his many fans eagerly awaiting this new volume and for readers who have enjoyed the works of Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Zadie Smith, and Rebecca Solnit, Gay once again offers us \"literature that feels as fluent and familiar as a chat with a close friend\" (the  New York Review of Books ).  The Book of (More) Delights  is a collection to savor and share. "

                "As a two-time Super Bowl champion, three-time Pro-Bowler, first round draft pick, and former Jim Thorpe Award recipient, Malcolm Jenkins knows a thing or two about winning.   Over the course of his thirteen-year NFL career, the now retired defensive back's triumphs extend beyond that on the football field. As a successful entrepreneur he has seen the blossoming of his business ventures with an eponymous company named Malcolm Inc., and a media conglomerate named Listen Up Media. As a philanthropist, he strives to make a positive difference in the lives of young people in underserved communities through The Malcolm Jenkins Foundation. And as the father of two daughters, he understands the challenges of loving his children, and preparing them for an often unkind and hostile world. But for every triumph, there is a tragedy, for every loss, a lesson.    In  What Winners Won't Tell You ,   Jenkins share with readers the insight he's gained from winning and losing alike. One moment, Jenkins is riding high from being the only NFL Player to have Super Bowl victories against Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady and then he's navigating the harrowing low of a divorce from the mother of his children. In another moment he's advocating for the advances of Black people in America, and then feuding publicly about the direction of this advocacy.    Providing fans and readers alike with an intimate portrayal of life on and off the field, detailed breakdowns of his greatest moments against the games premiere players, and poignant reflections about what it means to straddle the narrow line between victory and defeat,  What Winners Won't Tell You    is the best kept secret for those who want to know what it takes to be a champion.

                "A Black Minneapolis cop and inner-city football coach faces racial reckoning after the murder of George Floyd inflames his city and forces him to explore the tensions in the neighborhood where he grew up.   Charles Adams is a product of the Minneapolis's North Side, the city's poorest neighborhood, and of North High, the state's poorest school. After graduation he joined the Minneapolis Police Department, overcoming racial prejudice within its ranks to become his alma mater's resource officer. North High was in rapid decline, a building designed for 1,700 students down to about 200. Once the centerpiece of the community, the school was on the verge of folding. Then something magical happened.  Adams stepped in as football coach, and transformed a winless team into state champions. With that success came renewed pride in the school and neighborhood both. As North High began to thrive, Adams was hailed as a model of what a Black man from a Black neighborhood might be. That lasted until Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, which brought a rain of chaos upon Minneapolis. Working to maintain order in a riotous city, Adams feared for his life, his relationship to his community forever changed.  The memoir of a life divided,  Twin Cities  is the story of what happens when a man gives everything to his city in an effort to help kids envision a better future, only to have his city turn on him in response. Adams navigates the space between reality and perception, between law and justice, with the insight and wisdom he has gained from his unique experience. "

                "This program features an introduction read by the author. \"I am an eighties baby who grew to hate school. I never fully understood why. Until now. Until Bettina Love unapologetically and painstakingly chronicled the last forty years of education 'reform' in this landmark book. I hated school because it warred on me. I hated school because I loved to dream.\"     \u2014Ibram X. Kendi,  New York Times  bestselling author of  How to be an Antiracist     In the tradition of Michelle Alexander, an unflinching reckoning with the impact of 40 years of racist public school policy on generations of Black lives  In  Punished for Dreaming  Dr. Bettina Love argues forcefully that Reagan's presidency ushered in a War on Black Children, pathologizing and penalizing them in concert with the War on Drugs. New policies punished schools with policing, closure, and loss of funding in the name of reform, as white savior, egalitarian efforts increasingly allowed private interests to infiltrate the system. These changes implicated children of color, and Black children in particular, as low performing, making it all too easy to turn a blind eye to their disproportionate conviction and incarceration. Today, there is little national conversation about a structural overhaul of American schools; cosmetic changes, rooted in anti-Blackness, are now passed off as justice. It is time to put a price tag on the miseducation of Black children. In this prequel to  The New Jim Crow , Dr. Love serves up a blistering account of four decades of educational reform through the lens of the people who lived it.  Punished for Dreaming  lays bare the devastating effect on 25 Black Americans caught in the intersection of economic gain and racist ideology. Then, with input from leading U.S. economists ,  Dr. Love offers a road map for repair, arguing for reparations with transformation for all children at its core.

In these pages, we meet his great-grandmother Sophia, a tenant farmer born with the gift of prophecy who scraped together a life in Jim Crow Alabama; his mother, Laurie, who raised four kids alone in an era when single Black mothers were demonized as \u201cwelfare queens\u201d; and a cast of family, friends, and neighbors who won small victories in a world built to swallow Black lives.\u00a0With profound honesty and compassion, he raises questions that implicate us all: What does each person\u2019s struggle to build a life teach us about what we owe each other? About what it means to be human?\u00a0 \u00a0  How Far to the Promised Land  is a thrilling and tender epic about being Black in America.\u00a0It\u2019s a book that questions our too-simple narratives about poverty and upward mobility; a book in which the people normally written out of the American Dream are given voice.

In the mid-70s he formed the Neville Brothers with Art, Charles, and Cyril\u2014now known as the \"First Family of New Orleans\"\u2014and they released more than a dozen influential albums. Given his one-of-a-kind, soaring falsetto, Aaron was the breakout star, and over the next six decades, he had four platinum albums, three #1 songs, numerous film and television appearances, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2014. His triple-platinum duets with Linda Ronstadt (including the Grammy-Award-winning hit \"I Don't Know Much\") showcased the softer side of his voice, and the smoking hot funky soul of the Neville Brothers cemented his legacy as an R&B legend.  But few people know the challenging and circuitous road Aaron took to fame. Born in a housing project in New Orleans of Black and Native American heritage, Aaron struggled as a teenage father working to raise a family while building his career as a musician, surviving a stint in jail for car theft and many years battling heroin addiction.  \u200bRecognized by the dagger tattoo on his cheek and his St. Jude medallion earring, Neville credits St. Jude\u2014the patron saint of lost cases\u2014for turning his life around. He found healing and salvation in music. Aaron Neville is a man who by all accounts should not have made it.  Tell It Like It Is  shares his story for the first time. "

                "The first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia reveals in her memoir how her Christian faith, unwavering patriotism, and fervent commitment to conservative principles propelled her to serve and sacrifice for her country and a better future.   Winsome Earle-Sears sent shock waves across Virginia and the country at large when she pulled off her stunning upset victory in November 2021 and became the first woman lieutenant governor of Virginia and the first Black woman, the first naturalized female citizen, and first female veteran elected to statewide office. She earned intense national coverage because of her unwavering support for Second Amendment rights and her strong commitment to education opportunity for all students. Now in her memoir,  How Sweet It Is , Winsome will tell her story and explain how she arrived at that historic moment in time.    A devout Christian, Winsome is also a true believer in the promise of the American Dream. Her father was approved to immigrate to the U.S.A. and left Jamaica, arriving in America on August 11, 1963, with only $1.75 in his pocket. Winsome joined him when she was just six years old, and ever since she has never ceased enthusiastically bucking conventions, defying expectations, and charging straight toward challenges.    Winsome's remarkable story is one of faith and family, personal loss and perseverance, philanthropy and patriotism, service and sacrifice. But through it all, her Christian faith sustained her, drove her, and compelled her to give back to her community and her country. Her unyielding belief in the fundamental righteousness of America stands in stark opposition to the increasingly pervasive ideologies that are dividing the country. In  How Sweet It Is , Winsome encourages Americans to never stop fighting for their country and shows them how to chart a new path forward. "

                "From 1955 to 1975, Vera Pigee (1924-2007) put her life and livelihood on the line with grassroots efforts for social change in Mississippi, principally through her years of leadership in Coahoma County's NAACP. Known as the \"Lady of Hats,\" coined by NAACP executive secretary Roy Wilkins, Pigee was a businesswoman, mother, and leader. Her book, The Struggle of Struggles, offers a detailed view of the daily grind of organizing for years to open the state's closed society. Fearless, forthright, and fashionable, Pigee also suffered for her efforts at the hands of white supremacists and those unwilling to accept strong women in leadership. She wrote herself into the histories, confronted misinformation, and self-published one of the first autobiographies from the era. Women like her worked, often without accolade or recognition, in their communities all over the country, but did not document their efforts in this way. The Struggle of Struggles, originally published in 1975, spotlights the gendered and generational tensions within the civil rights movement. It outlines the complexity, frustrations, and snubs, as well as the joy and triumphs that Pigee experienced and witnessed in the quest for a fairer and more equitable nation. "

                "On a sweltering day in August 1960, in the segregated Deep South city of Jacksonville, Florida, a seventeen-year-old Black boy finished his dishwashing job at Morrison's Cafeteria, walked out the back door, and found himself in the middle of a nightmare. Hundreds of white men with ax handles and baseball bats were attacking Black sit-in protestors in Hemming Park. Suddenly surrounded, the young man endured menacing blows and racist taunts. He called for help from a white police officer standing nearby, but no help came. And he felt an unwarranted shame he determined never to feel again. His name was Nat Glover. Nat's life could have ended that day, but instead, the ordeal reinforced his plans to become a police officer. His belief in a better world could have faded to cynicism, but instead, it took root in his spirit. His desire to overcome the poverty and racism of his youth could have given in to shame, but instead, Nat resolved to dedicate his life to honoring the dignity of all people. Nat Glover went on to serve in law enforcement for thirty-seven years, became the first Black sheriff in Jacksonville and the state of Florida since Reconstruction, and chose\u2014again and again\u2014to do the right thing at the right time for the sake of justice, compassion, and truth. In Striving for Justice, Nat recounts his history-making years in police reformation,the values that fuel him as a leader and American citizen, and what he believes will move this country forward toward hope and healing just as he once rose again ... against all odds.

Born in 1945, Ruth J. Simmons grew up the twelfth child of sharecroppers. Her first home had no running water, no electricity, no books to read. Yet despite this\u2014or, in her words, because of it\u2014Simmons would become\u00a0the first Black president of an Ivy League university. The former president of Smith College, Brown University, and Prairie View A&M, Texas\u2019s oldest HBCU, Simmons has inspired generations of students as she herself made history. In  Up Home,  Simmons takes us back to Grapeland to show how the people who love us when we are young shape who we become. We meet her caring, tireless mother who managed to feed her large family with an often empty pantry; her father, who refused to let racial and economic injustice crush his youngest daughter\u2019s dreams; the doting brothers and sisters; and the attentive teachers who welcomed Ruth into the classroom, guiding her to a future she could hardly imagine as a child. From the farmland of East Texas to Houston\u2019s Fifth Ward to New Orleans at the dawn of the civil rights movement, Simmons depicts an era long gone but whose legacies of inequality we still live with today. Written in clear and timeless prose,  Up Home  is both an origin story set in the segregated South and the uplifting chronicle of a girl whose intellect, grace, and curiosity guide her as she creates a place for herself in the world.

To rent his own apartment, he needed a paycheck-something the money from dealing drugs didn't provide. For that, he took a position in 1992 with a new nonprofit, the Earth Conservation Corps. Gradually, Rodney fell in love with the work to restore and conserve the polluted Anacostia River that flows through DC. As conditions along the river improved, he helped to reintroduce bald eagles to the region and befriended an injured Eurasian Eagle Owl named Mr. Hoots, the first of many birds whose respect he would work hard to earn. Bird Brother is a story about pursuing dreams against all odds, and the importance of second chances. Rodney's life was nearly upended when he was arrested on drug charges in 2002. The jail sentence sharpened his resolve to get out of the hustling life. With the fierceness of the raptors he had admired for so long, he began to train to become a master falconer and to develop his own raptor education program and sanctuary. Rodney's son Mike, a DC firefighter, has also begun his journey to being a master falconer, with his own kids cheering him along the way. "

From the first African American to serve in the House, to immigrants elected at the dawn of the 20th century, all were trailblazers who made significant contributions to the country. The book provides an inspiring story of America through profiles of each of them, representatives of all political stripes who overcame the odds and demonstrated the courage to challenge powerful interests, and at times, their own political allies. The nine members of Congress are:   -Joseph Rainey, South Carolina  -Josiah Walls, Florida  -William B. Wilson, Pennsylvania  -Adolph Sabath, Illinois  -Oscar Stanton De Priest, Illinois  -Margaret Chase Smith, Maine  -Henry B. Gonzalez, Texas  -Shirley Chisholm, New York  -Barbara Jordan, Texas   Representative Joe Neguse, the first African American elected to the Congress from Colorado, shares how these nine ordinary Americans served nobly despite the barriers before them and did extraordinary things in service to their constituents, the Constitution, and the country.

                "Chris Paul, \"The Point God,\" a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team and current point guard for the Phoenix Suns, narrates this compelling memoir. Deeply affected by the untimely death of his grandfather, Nathaniel \"PaPa Chili\" Jones, Paul recounts the inspiration and influence PaPa Chili continues to play in his life and career.  A powerful and unexpected memoir of family, faith, tragedy, and life's most important lessons.   The day after future NBA superstar Chris Paul signed his letter of intent to play college basketball for Wake Forest, he received a world-shattering phone call. His grandfather, Nathaniel \"Papa\" Jones, a pillar of the Winston-Salem community where he owned and operated the first Black-owned service station in North Carolina, was mugged and ultimately died from a heart attack resulting from the assault. His funeral filled the largest church in the county, which held over one thousand people. He was sixty-one years old. The day after burying his grandfather, Chris was coping the best way he knew how: by playing basketball for his high school team. After pouring in shot after shot, his last attempt was an airball purposely flung out of bounds from the foul line before Chris exited the game. The next day, local news headlines declared that he fell six points shy of the statewide single game high school scoring record. But he accomplished exactly what he set out to do: scoring sixty-one points, one for each year of life lived by his grandfather. In  Sixty-One , Chris opens up about life beyond basketball and the role his grandfather played in molding him into the man and father he is today. He'll speak about the foundation of faith and family he built his life upon, what it means to be a positive light within your community and beyond, and the importance of setting the proper example for future generations. Most importantly, Chris will talk about his home, Winston-Salem, and the close-knit family and village that raised him to become one of the most respected leaders in all of sports.

                "An unforgettable and stirring memoir in the vein of  Free Cyntoia ,  Just Mercy , and  The Sum of Us  that both inspires and upends our understanding about the future of policing in the United States.    In 2012, nineteen-year-old Leon Ford was shot five times by a Pittsburgh police officer as he was racially profiled during a case of mistaken identity. When he woke up in the hospital, he was faced with two life-changing realities: he was a new father, and he was paralyzed from the waist down.   Now, Ford reveals how he faced these new truths and discovered the power of forgiveness and letting go of his hatred. He explains how his harrowing experience inspired his lifelong commitment to social activism. In the wake of countless similar shootings across the country over the years, he has dedicated himself to bridging the gap between the police and the communities they are supposed to serve.   With his compassionate voice, Ford not only offers fresh, counterintuitive advice for social change but also demonstrates how together, we can end police brutality and heal as a country. As he once said, \"Lead with love. Start compassionate conversations even with individuals and systems that have caused you pain. I know from experience that you can make your pain purposeful.\" "

                "An Amerikan Family is a light helping us go forward.\" \u2014   Nikki Giovanni, poet    An enlightening history of the rise and lasting impact of Black liberation groups in America, as seen through the Shakurs, one of the movement's most prominent and fiercely creative families, home to Tupac and Assata, and a powerful incubator for today's activism, scholarship, and artistry.   They have been celebrated, glorified, and mythologized. They have been hailed as heroes, liberators, and freedom fighters. They have been condemned, pursued, imprisoned, exiled, and killed. But the true and complete story of the Shakur family\u2014one of the most famous names in contemporary Black American history\u2014has never been told.  For over fifty years, the Shakurs have inspired generations of activists, scholars, and music fans. Many people are only familiar with Assata Shakur, the popular author and thinker, living for three decades in Cuban exile; or the late rapper Tupac. But the branches of the Shakur family tree extend widely, and the roots reach into the most furtive and hidden depths of the underground.  An Amerikan Family is a history of the fight for Black liberation in the United States, as experienced and shaped by the Shakur family. It is the story of hope and betrayal, addiction and murder, persecution and revolution. An Amerikan Family is not only family genealogy; it is the story of Black America's long struggle for racial justice and the nation's covert and repressive tactics to defeat that struggle. It is the story of a small but determined community, taking extreme, unconventional, and often perilous measures in the quest for freedom. In short, the story of the Shakurs is the story of America.

He experienced the traumas of racial discrimination, death, divorce, football-related injuries, and a never-ending search for his own identity. In his search, Perkins ventured into sportscasting, public speaking, community relations, big-rig trucking, government work, and even amateur theater, where he portrayed Frederick Douglass and other famous Black leaders. Through it all, he remained a kind, unassuming, charismatic man, universally admired by family members, friends, and millions of fans. Don Perkins: A Champion's Life is the final tribute he so greatly deserves. "

Joseph McGill Jr., a historic preservationist and Civil War reenactor, founded the Slave Dwelling Project in 2010 based on an idea that was sparked and first developed in 1999. Since founding the project, McGill has been touring the country, spending the night in former slave dwellings\u2014throughout the South, but also the North and the West, where people are often surprised to learn that such structures exist. Events and gatherings are arranged around these overnight stays, and it provides a unique way to understand the often otherwise obscured and distorted history of slavery. The project has inspired difficult conversations about race in communities from South Carolina to Alabama to Texas to Minnesota to New York, and all over the United States.  Sleeping with the Ancestors  focuses on all of the key sites McGill has visited in his ongoing project and digs deeper into the actual history of each location, using McGill's own experience and conversations with the community to enhance those original stories. Altogether, McGill and coauthor Herb Frazier give readers an important unexpected emersion into the history of slavery, and especially the obscured and ignored aspects of that history. "

                "This first complete biography of poet and writer Margaret Walker (1915\u201398) offers a comprehensive close reading of a pillar in American culture for a majority of the 20th century. Without defining herself as a radical or even a feminist, Walker followed the precepts of both. She was an artist of tradition and social change, a public intellectual and institution builder. Among the first to recognize the impact of black women in literature, Walker became a chief architect of what many have called the new Black South Renaissance. Her art was influenced early by Langston Hughes, her political understanding of the world by Richard Wright. Walker expanded both into a comprehensive view on art and humanism, which became a national platform for the center she founded in Mississippi that now bears her name. The House Where My Soul Lives provides a full account of Walker's life and new interpretations of her writings before and after the publication of her most wellknown poem in the 1930s in Chicago. The book rejects the widely held view of Walker as the \"angry black woman\" and emphasizes what contemporary American culture owes to her decades of foundational work in what we know today as Black Studies, Women's Studies, and the Public Humanities. She was fierce in her claim to be \"black, female, and free\" which gave her the authority to challenge all hierarchies, no matter at what cost. Based on never-before examined personal papers and interviews with those who knew Walker personally, this book is required reading for all readers of biographies of American writers. "

                "This extraordinary memoir of struggle and perseverance offers new ways of envisioning economic equality for  everyone \u2014from a leading activist and fashion pioneer.       \u201cWith community and sisterhood at its center,  Wildflower  teaches us that against all odds, we can overcome.\u201d\u2014Rupi Kaur,  New York  Times bestselling author of  milk and honey    ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2023:  Harper\u2019s Bazaar   Aurora James\u2019s life is a great American \u201csuccess story\u201d\u2014precisely because it looks so different from others we\u2019ve seen. Born in Canada to a counterculture mother, James was raised to question everything\u2014specifically the very institutions that have shaped so many of us. When James was seven, her mother married a man who would move them to Jamaica, where James would learn harsh lessons about control, power, abuse, and belonging. Eventually she would find her way back home to Toronto, where her blue-eyed and fair-haired grandmother welcomed her with unconditional love\u2014and inadvertently showed her that racism is the water in which we are all submerged. \u00a0 Scouted as a model in eighth grade, James struggled with body image and became disenchanted by the industry\u2019s objectification of women and commodification of race and culture. After she dropped out of high school, a flirtation with street racing led to her eventual arrest. She\u2019d hit rock bottom, but as a visionary and optimist, she allowed that experience to become one of many that reshaped her way of thinking about the world. A slew of fashion-related jobs led James to discover the real power in creating for the runway, and she started her own business in a flea market: a sustainable fashion line showcasing traditional African designs that would become an award-winning international brand. But none of this came from a drive to \u201csucceed.\u201d It came from a desire to forge a new creative path\u2014and to lift others up alongside her. \u00a0 Already a rising star in fashion and the first Black female designer to win a Council of Fashion Designers of America Award, James posted a revolutionary idea in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder that connected economics to racial justice in a way that has forever changed the American economic landscape. With that Instagram post, she founded the Fifteen Percent Pledge, which challenges retailers to commit 15 percent of their shelf space and spending power to Black businesses and is one of the fastest-growing social justice nonprofits. To date, more than two dozen of the world\u2019s most recognized retailers have taken the pledge, redirecting $10 billion in annual revenue to Black and BIPOC brands. \u00a0 Empowering and full of heart,  Wildflower  is the riveting story of how Aurora James made an indelible mark the American economic system, and a rallying cry for those eager to make change.

There he became a self-described \u201ccloseted biracial person,\u201d hostile toward white people while hiding the truth of his mother\u2019s race. The son of a Black man and a white woman who met when interracial marriage was still illegal, Blake knew this much about his mother: She vanished from his life not long after his birth, and her family rejected him because of his race. But at the age of seventeen, Blake had a surprise encounter that uncovered a disturbing family secret. This launched him on a quest to reconcile with his white family. His search centered on two questions: \u201cWhere is my mother?\u201d and \u201cWhere do I belong?\u201d  More Than I Imagined  is Blake\u2019s propulsive true story about how he answered those questions with the help of an interracial church, a loving caregiver\u2019s sacrifice, and an inexplicable childhood encounter that taught him the importance of forgiveness. Blake covered some of the biggest stories about race in America for twenty-five years before realizing that \u201cfacts don\u2019t change people, relationships do.\u201d He owes this discovery to \u201cradical integration,\u201d which was the only way forward for him and his family\u2014and is the only way forward for America as a multiracial democracy.  More Than I Imagined  is a hopeful story for our difficult times. "

                "In the years following Brown v. Board of Education, countless Black citizens endured violent resistance and even death while fighting for their constitutional rights. One of those citizens, Clyde Kennard, a Korean War veteran and civil rights leader from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, attempted repeatedly to enroll at the all-white Mississippi Southern College in the late 1950s. In A Slow, Calculated Lynching, Devery S. Anderson tells the story of a man who paid the ultimate price for trying to attend a white college during Jim Crow. Anderson examines the relentless subterfuge against Kennard, including the cruelly successful attempts to frame him-once for a misdemeanor and then for a felony. This second conviction resulted in a sentence at Mississippi State Penitentiary, forever disqualifying him from attending a state-sponsored school. While imprisoned, he developed cancer, was denied care, then sadly died six months after the governor commuted his sentence. In this prolonged lynching, Clyde Kennard was robbed of his ambitions and ultimately his life, but his final days and legacy reject the notion that he was powerless. Anderson highlights the resolve of friends and fellow activists to posthumously restore his name. He was gone, but countless others still benefit from Kennard's legacy and the biracial, bipartisan effort he inspired. "

                "\"The war of my life had begun; and though one of God's most powerless creatures, I resolved never to be conquered.\"\u2014Harriet Jacobs From Harriet Jacobs' experience as a fugitive, to Susie King Taylor's life as a nurse and teacher for the Union Army, to the powerful life of journalist and activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Black women have always stood at the center of the fight for freedom and progress. All three were born enslaved, yet each found the courage and grit to push back against societal norms to fight for or simply take their freedom. Truth Be Told comprises three powerful narratives written by formerly enslaved women who lived long past emancipation. Each narrative offers a window into time and moves the listener along chronologically from the early years of a new nation, through the Civil War, and up through the perilous years of Reconstruction. Award-winning author and historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar provides an accessible and engaging introduction and afterword for each narrative, tying these figures' lives to the arc of Black history and illuminating connections to the current global social justice movement that focuses on Black life. The afterword for Harriet Jacobs' Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl focuses on sexual violence, escape, being hunted, and looking for safety in the United States. For Susie King Taylor's Reminiscences of My Life in Camp with the 33d United States Colored Troops: Late 1st S. C. Volunteers, the conclusion focuses on women and military service, war, Confederate monuments, and federal occupation. Finally, the afterword for Ida B. Wells-Barnett's Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases focuses on the rise of racial violence and the murder of Black men, women, and children at the hands of citizens and law enforcement. This compilation serves as the ultimate collection of classic narratives written by three Black women social justice advocates who provided gripping testimony about their experiences in order to remind their nineteenth-century readers that Black lives mattered.

                "Born on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Samuel Ringgold Ward (1817-c. 1869) escaped enslavement and would become a leading figure in the struggle for Black freedom, citizenship, and equality. He was extolled by his contemporary Frederick Douglass for his \"depth of thought, fluency of speech, readiness of wit, logical exactness.\" Until now, his story has been largely untold. Ward, a newspaper editor, Congregational minister, and advocate for the temperance movement, was considered one of the leading orators of his time. After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 he fled to Canada, where he lectured widely to improve conditions for formerly enslaved people who had settled there. Ward then went to Britain as an agent of the Canadian Antislavery Society and published his influential book Autobiography of a Fugitive Negro. He never returned to the United States, and he died in obscurity in Jamaica. Despite Ward's prominent role in the abolitionist movement, his story has been lost because of the decades he spent in exile. In this book, R. J. M. Blackett brings light to Ward's life and his important role in the struggle against slavery and discrimination, and to the personal price he paid for confronting oppression. "

                "The raw and gripping memoir of a Black physician who confronts his past mistakes and relationships as he learns to find his own path forward   At first glance, Anthony Chin-Quee looks like a traditional success story: a smart, ambitious kid who grew up to become a board-certified otolaryngologist\u2014an ear, nose, and throat surgeon. Yet the truth is more complicated.  \u00a0  As a self-described \u201cnot white, mostly Black, and questionably Asian man,\u201d Chin-Quee knows that he doesn\u2019t fit easily into any category. Growing up in a family with a background of depression, he struggled with relationships, feelings of inadequacy, and a fear of failure that made it difficult for him to forge lasting bonds with others.  \u00a0  To repair that, he began his own unflinching examination of what it means to be both a physician and a Black man today. What saved him and his sanity was not medicine but storytelling:\u00a0by sharing stories from his life and career, Chin-Quee learned how powerful the truth can be in helping to forgive yourself and others as you chart a new way forward.  By turns harrowing and hilarious, honest and human,  I Can\u2019t Save You  is the fascinating true story of how looking within can change you and your life for the better. "

                "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    \"[An] outstanding debut.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly (starred review)    The award-winning journalist and co-host of CBS Saturday Morning tells the candid, and deeply personal story of her mother's abandonment and how the search for answers forced her to reckon with her own identity and the secrets that shaped her family for five decades.   Though Michelle Miller was an award-winning broadcast journalist for CBS News, few people in her life knew the painful secret she carried: her mother had abandoned her at birth. Los Angeles in 1967 was deeply segregated, and her mother\u2014a Chicana hospital administrator who presented as white, had kept her affair with Michelle's father, Dr. Ross Miller, a married trauma surgeon and Compton's first Black city councilman\u2014hidden, along with the unplanned pregnancy. Raised largely by her father and her paternal grandmother, Michelle had no knowledge of the woman whose genes she shared. Then, fate intervened when Michelle was twenty-two. As her father lay stricken with cancer, he told her, \"Go and find your mother.\"  Belonging is the chronicle of Michelle's decades-long quest to connect with the woman who gave her life, to confront her past, and ultimately, to find her voice as a journalist, a wife, and a mother. Michelle traces the years spent trying to make sense of her mixed-race heritage and her place in white-dominated world. From the wealthy white schools where she was bussed to integrate, to the newsrooms filled with white, largely male faces, she revisits the emotional turmoil of her formative years and how the enigma of her mother and her rejection shaped Michelle's understanding of herself and her own Blackness.  As she charts her personal journey, Michelle looks back on her decades on the ground reporting painful events, from the beating of Rodney King to the death of George Floyd, revealing how her struggle to understand her racial identity coincides with the nation's own ongoing and imperfect racial reckoning. What emerges is an intimate family story about secrets\u2014secrets we keep, secrets we share, and the secrets that make us who we are. "

                "This program is read by the author. In the literary tradition of Carmen Maria Machado's  In the Dream House , Maxine Hong Kingston's  The Woman Warrior , and Jesmyn Ward's  Men We Reaped , this debut memoir confronts both the challenges and joys of growing up Black and making your own truth.  Growing up as a Black girl in America, Deborah Mouton felt alienated from the stories she learned in class. She yearned for stories she felt connected to\u2014true ones of course\u2014but also fables and mythologies that could help explain both the world and her place in it. What she encountered was almost always written by white writers who prospered in a time when human beings were treated as chattel, such as the Greek and Roman myths, which felt as dusty and foreign as ancient ruins. When she sought myths written by Black authors, they were rooted too far in the past, a continent away. Mouton writes, \"The phrases of my mother and grandmother began to seem less colloquial and more tied to stories that had been lost along the way. . . . Mythmaking isn't a lie. It is our moment to take the privilege of our own creativity to fill in the gaps that colonization has stolen from us. It is us choosing to write the tales that our children pull strength from. It is hijacking history for the ignorance in its closets. This, a truth that must start with the women.\" Mouton's memoir  Black Chameleon  is a song of praise and an elegy for Black womanhood. With a poet's gift for lyricism and poignancy, Mouton reflects on her childhood as the daughter of a preacher and a harsh but loving mother, living in the world as a Black woman whose love is all too often coupled with danger, and finally learning to be a mother to another Black girl in America. Of the moment yet timeless, playful but incendiary, Mouton has staked out new territory in the memoir form.  A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt & Company. "

                "Loving's Love is the inspiring autobiography of Neal V. Loving, an aeronautical engineer, experimental aircraft designer, and true aviation pioneer. Despite racism that barred him from most aviation opportunities, as well as a near-fatal flying accident that resulted in the loss of his legs, Loving remained optimistic, ambitious, and resourceful. He triumphed over those who doubted and denied him to become the first African American and first person with bilateral amputation to be licensed as a racing pilot. Loving designed and flew five aircraft throughout his lifetime, the first when he was a young high school graduate. This book centers on his midget one-seater racing plane, the WR-1 Loving's Love that he flew from Detroit, Michigan, to Kingston, Jamaica\u2014an impressive feat for a plane of its kind. Describing his early days as a fledgling designer and his years as the owner of a flying school he opened to students of all races, Loving often refers to his personal creed, \"No success without enthusiasm.\" At age forty he enrolled as a full-time engineering student, going on to a long and distinguished career as an aerospace research engineer. Loving's Love is the story of a man who exemplified the abiding love of flight that spurred the first barnstormers, and who left behind a triumphant legacy. "

As Rob survived two decades at America's bloodiest penitentiary and Fox raised their sons solo, they never stopped fighting for Rob's freedom and for their futures against the statistical odds. All the while, it was love that carried them through. The Academy Award-nominated documentary Time introduced audiences to Fox and Rob, who riveted audiences with their relentless fight for each other and justice, despite America's broken prison system. This book tells the rest of their story. In alternating voices and intimate detail, Fox and Rob reveal what the film does not-how a person can cultivate the radical love needed to see them through any hardship and how miracles can happen on the way. As they peel back the layers of their unforgettable love story, you'll discover the secrets of perseverance and the power of a resilience that is founded on faith in a God who never gives up on us. "

Every single word he speaks will challenge, enlighten and encourage you to become a better version of yourself and see a better version of the world. Perkins' riveting stories about the NBA, his upbringing and social justice will make this ... impossible to put down.\" \u2014Emmanuel Acho,  New York Times  bestselling author of  Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man    Kendrick \"Perk\" Perkins is known for his blunt, opinionated, \"carry the hell on\" commentary on ESPN's most popular shows. As a fourteen-year NBA player and starting center for the 2008 NBA champion Boston Celtics, Perk earned a reputation as an enforcer, a fierce defender, and a great teammate. Now, In  The Education of Kendrick Perkins , he opens a different side of himself: a powerful and intimate memoir that goes beyond basketball to discuss the reality of being Black in America. Abandoned by his father, then orphaned after the murder of his mother, Perk was raised by his grandparents in a small Texas town. He left their home at age eighteen, drafted out of high school by the legendary Celtics. For a country boy, Boston was a completely new world, and the NBA a league of legends: Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Kevin Garnett, James Harden, Shaquille O'Neal, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Kevin Durant, and more. Perk had to learn how to play with and against these stars, while adjusting to life on the road as a professional athlete.  But his education went beyond basketball. In this audiobook, Perk reveals his awakening consciousness of larger issues that affected him, his fellow players, and Black Americans: -How many NBA players grow up in broken families and difficult circumstances -The history of slavery and how that trauma affects generations of Black life -The truths told by writers including James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, and others -The false myths about the Black family and fatherhood -Why George Floyd's murder forced a reckoning about race in America Honest, fearless, dramatic, filled with stories about life on and off the court,  The Education of Kendrick Perkins  is a unique memoir that shows how he and we all can \"carry the hell on.\"  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press.

For fans of Indra Nooyi's  My Life in Full  and Viola Davis's  Finding Me .  As an accomplished Microsoft executive, Bruce Jackson handles billions of dollars of commerce as its associate general counsel while he plays a crucial role in the company's corporate diversity efforts. But few of his colleagues can understand the weight he carries with him to the office each day. He kept his past hidden from sight as he ascended the corporate ladder but shares it in full for the first time here.    Born in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Jackson moved to Manhattan's Amsterdam housing projects as a child, where he had already been falsely accused and arrested for robbery by the age of ten. At the age of fifteen, he witnessed the homicide of his close friend. Taken in by the criminal justice system, seduced by a burgeoning drug trade, and burdened by a fractured, impoverished home life, Jackson stood on the edge of failure. But he was saved by an offer. That offer set him on a better path, off the streets and eventually on the way to Georgetown Law, but not without hard knocks along the way.    But even as he racked up professional accomplishments, Jackson is still haunted by the unchanged world outside his office.    From public housing to working for Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, and its founder, Bill Gates, to advising some of the biggest stars in music, Bruce Jackson's  Never Far from Home  reveals the ups and downs of an incredible journey, how he overcame many obstacles and the valuable lessons learned along the way.

For her young niece Goldie Taylor, abandoned by her mother and coping with trauma of her own, life in Gerald's East St. Louis comes with nothing but a threadbare blanket on the living room floor.    But amid the pain and anguish, Goldie discovers a secret. She can find kinship among writers like James Baldwin and Toni Morrison. She can find hope in a nurturing teacher who helps her find her voice. And books, she realizes, can save her life.  Goldie Taylor's debut memoir shines a light on the strictures of race, class and gender in a post\u2013Jim Crow America while offering a nuanced, empathetic portrait of a family in a pitched battle for its very soul.  Profoundly moving, exquisitely rendered and ultimately uplifting, The Love You Save   is a story about hidden strength, perseverance against unimaginable odds, the beauty and pain of girlhood, and the power of the written word.

                "When  The Real Housewives of New York City  hired its first black cast member after more than 13 years on the air, attorney, speaker, and journalist Eboni K. Williams knew that the public would consider her a diversity hire. But instead of accepting the label, Williams re-envisioned her role as a \"Diversity Higher,\" an opportunity to prove the significance of Black excellence in the workspace and in society at-large. In  Bet on Black , she shares all the benefits and advantages that have helped her and many others historically reach great heights in their careers and beyond.    Williams declares that Blackness is her superpower toward success, and shows how it's been instrumental for achieving her dreams. She takes us on a journey through an extraordinary life growing up in the South with a single mother, being a pageant girl, attending law school in Louisiana, working as a litigator, reporting for Fox News, and becoming an influential voice in today's media landscape. Her writing is at turns entertaining, relatable, and incredibly inspiring; after finishing this book, readers will be reawakened to own their worth and understand the value of celebrating Blackness (whether theirs or others). Empowering others to maximize their potential with zero apologies is her life's work as well as her lifestyle, she says, \"No longer can we settle on just asking that Black people be comfortable. We can do better than settle for surviving, we can achieve never-ending thriving!\"    As Williams says in her  RHONY  tagline, \"I've had to work twice as hard for half as much, but now I'm coming for everything.\" And in   Bet on Black   ,  Williams invites her readers to join her on the quest to show the world what Black excellence  really  means.

Stacy Spikes knows what's it like to be an outsider. Finding his footing in the tech world was an education in the complexities of being an outsider-but as Stacy came to see, rather than a hindrance, it afforded him a unique position of power. Beginning as a film studio gopher, Spikes quickly rose through the industry ranks, being named one of the Hollywood Reporter's 30 Under 30. Still, he was an outsider looking in. Defying expectations, Spikes effectively disrupted the status quo and reinvented himself from junior executive to CEO Tech Founder. What ensued was an escalating adventure with bigger stages, bigger risks, and a roller-coaster ride of exhilarating ascent-unpredictable collapse-and a story book return. Taking listeners inside the battles of the boardroom and beyond, Black Founder is a business memoir that will inspire every outsider who has a dream. "

                "From celebrated ballerina and  New York Times  bestselling author Misty Copeland, a heartfelt memoir about her friendship with trailblazer Raven Wilkinson which captures the importance of mentorship, shared history, and honoring the past to ensure a stronger future.  Misty Copeland made history as the first African-American principal ballerina at the American Ballet Theatre. Her talent, passion, and perseverance enabled her to make strides no one had accomplished before. But as she will tell you, achievement never happens in a void. Behind her, supporting her rise was her mentor Raven Wilkinson. Raven had been virtually alone in her quest to breach the all-white ballet world when she fought to be taken seriously as a Black ballerina in the 1950s and 60s. A trailblazer in the world of ballet decades before Misty's time, Raven faced overt and casual racism, hostile crowds, and death threats for having the audacity to dance ballet.  The Wind at My Back  tells the story of two unapologetically Black ballerinas, their friendship, and how they changed each other\u2014and the dance world\u2014forever. Misty Copeland shares her own struggles with racism and exclusion in her pursuit of this dream career and honors the women like Raven who paved the way for her but whose contributions have gone unheralded. She celebrates the connection she made with her mentor, the only teacher who could truly understand the obstacles she faced, beyond the technical or artistic demands. A beautiful and wise memoir of intergenerational friendship and the impressive journeys of two remarkable women,  The Wind at My Back  captures the importance of mentorship, of shared history, and of respecting the past to ensure a stronger future.

                "The revered civil rights activist and pioneering member of Congress chronicles her groundbreaking 1972 run for President as the first woman and person of color\u2014a work of immense historical importance that both captures and transcends its times, newly reissued to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of her campaign.   Before Kamala Harris, before Hillary Rodham Clinton there was Shirley Chisholm. In 1972, the Congresswoman from New York\u2014the first Black woman elected to Congress\u2014made history again when she announced her candidacy for President of the United States. Though she understood victory was a longshot, Chisholm chose to run \"because someone had to do it first. . . . I ran because most people think the country is not ready for a black candidate, not ready for a woman candidate.\"   In this invaluable political memoir, Chisholm reflects on her unique campaign and a nation at the crossroads of change. With the striking candor and straightforward style for which she was famous, Chisholm reveals the essential wheeling and dealing inherent to campaigning, castigates the innate conservatism and piety of the Black majority of the period, decries identity politics that lead to destructive power struggles within a fractious Democratic Party, and offers prescient advice on the direction of Black politics. From the whirlwind of the primaries to the final dramatic maneuvering at the tumultuous 1972 Democratic National Convention, The Good Fight is an invaluable portrait of twentieth-century politics and a Democratic Party in flux.  Most importantly, The Good Fight is the portrait of a reformer who dedicated her life to making politics work for all Americans. Chisholm saw her campaign as an extension of her political commitment; she ran as an idealist grounded in reality who used her opportunity and position to give voice to all the forgotten. This book bears the stamp of her remarkable personality and her commitment to speaking truth no matter the consequences. "

With his dance crew Uptown Express, Wright won recognition on  Star Search , toured with Run-DMC, and transitioned into management, co-founding his wife Sunshine's music group, The Cover Girls. They'd settled in the New Jersey suburbs to raise their six-year-old daughter, never imagining that Wright would fall victim to gross police misconduct and a corrupt district attorney. Accused of being a drug \"kingpin\" and incarcerated in Somerset County while the prosecutor and police built their case of lies against him, Wright realized he would get no help from any defense attorneys\u2014white men uninterested in uncovering the truth or in proving the innocence of a black man. Pressured to take a plea deal offer of 20 years behind bars, Wright chose to take the law into his own hands by educating himself in the legal system so he could represent himself in court. Studying statutes and cases in the jail's law library, Wright became an adept legal mind. But despite acquiring knowledge that he put to use in defending his fellow inmates, he lost his trial and was sentenced to Trenton State Prison for life, plus 70 years in 1991. For the next five years, Wright would continue learning law, become a paralegal with the prison's Inmate Legal Association, and appeal his case. Threatened by corrupt correction officers and convicts, his family falling apart, Wright fought for his life with every legal means at his disposal, eventually uncovering the smoking gun that unraveled the conspiracy perpetrated by law enforcement officials against him.  Marked for Life  is not just the story of how Isaac Wright Jr. won his freedom. It is the story of how he found his true calling as a gladiator fighting on behalf of the oppressed and marginalized communities victimized by an unjust system of law.

                "A major poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906) was one of the first African American writers to garner international recognition in the wake of emancipation. In this definitive biography, the first full-scale life of Dunbar in half a century, Gene Andrew Jarrett offers a revelatory account of a writer whose Gilded Age celebrity as the \"poet laureate of his race\" hid the private struggles of a man who, in the words of his famous poem, felt like a \"caged bird\" that sings. Jarrett tells the fascinating story of how Dunbar, born during Reconstruction to formerly enslaved parents, excelled against all odds to become an accomplished and versatile artist. A prolific and successful poet, novelist, essayist, playwright, and Broadway librettist, he was also a friend of such luminaries as Frederick Douglass and Orville and Wilbur Wright. But while audiences across the United States and Europe flocked to enjoy his literary readings, Dunbar privately bemoaned shouldering the burden of race and catering to minstrel stereotypes to earn fame and money. Inspired by his parents' survival of slavery, but also agitated by a turbulent public marriage, beholden to influential benefactors, and helpless against his widely reported bouts of tuberculosis and alcoholism, he came to regard his racial notoriety as a curse as well as a blessing before dying at the age of thirty-three.

                "*A LitHub Most Anticipated Book of 2022*   The definitive biography of Charles Barkley, exploring his early childhood, his storied NBA career, and his enduring legacy as a provocative voice in American pop culture  He's one of the most interesting American athletes in the past fifty years. Passionate, candid, iconoclastic, and gifted both on and off the court, Charles Barkley has made a lasting impact on not only the world of basketball but pop culture at large. Yet few people know the real Charles. Raised by his mother and grandmother in Leeds, Alabama, he struggled in his early years to fit in until he found a sense of community and purpose in basketball. In the NBA he went toe-to-toe with the biggest legends in the game, from Magic to Michael to Hakeem to Shaq. But in the years since, he has become a bold agitator for social change, unafraid to grapple, often brashly, with even the thorniest of cultural issues facing our nation today. Informed by over 370 original interviews and painstaking research, Timothy Bella's Barkley is the most comprehensive biography to date of one of the most talked-about icons in the world of sports.

                "In this long-overdue celebration of Black women's resilience and unheralded strength, the revered, trailblazing White House correspondent reflects on \"The Year That Changed Everything\"\u20142020\u2014and African-American women's unprecedented role in upholding democracy.   \"I am keenly aware that everyone and everything has a story,\" April D. Ryan acknowledges. \"Also, I have always marveled at Black women and how we work to move mountains and are never really thanked or recognized.\" In Black Women Will Save the World, she melds these two truths, creating an inspiring and heart-tugging portrait of one of the momentous years in America, 2020\u2014when America elected its first Black woman Vice President\u2014and celebrates the tenacity, power, and impact of Black women across America.  From the beginning of the nation to today, Black women have transformed their pain into progress and have been at the frontlines of the nation's political, social, and economic struggles. These \"Sheroes\" as Ryan calls them, include current political leaders such as Maxine Waters, Valerie Jarrett, and Kamala Harris; Brittany Packnett Cunningham, LaTosha Brown, and other activists; and artists like Regina King. Combining profiles and in-depth interviews with these influential movers and shakers and many more, Ryan explores the challenges Black women endure, and how the lessons they've learned can help us shape our own stories. Ryan also chronicles her personal journey from working-class Baltimore to the elite echelons of journalism and speaks out about the hurdles she faced in becoming one of the most well-connected members of the Washington press corps\u2014while raising two daughters as a single mother in the aftermath of a messy divorce.  It is time for everyone to acknowledge Black women's unrivaled contributions to America. Yet our democracy remains in peril, and their work is far from done. Black Women Will Save the World presents a vital kaleidoscopic look at women of different ages and from diverse backgrounds who devote their lives to making the world a better place\u2014even if that means stepping out of their \"place.\"  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.

Jemele Hill's world came crashing down when she called President Trump a \"white supremacist\"; the White House wanted her fired from ESPN, and she was deluged with death threats. But Hill had faced tougher adversaries growing up in Detroit than a tweeting president. Beneath the exterior of one of the most recognizable journalists in America was a need\u2014a calling\u2014to break her family's cycle of intergenerational trauma.  Born in the middle of a lively routine Friday night Monopoly game to a teen mother and a heroin-addicted father, Hill constantly adjusted to the harsh realities of not only her own childhood but the inherited generational pain of her mother and grandmother. Her escape was writing.  Hill's mother was less than impressed with the brassy and bold free expression of her diary, but Hill never stopped discovering and amplifying her voice. Through hard work and a constant willingness to learn, Hill rose from newspaper reporter to columnist to new heights as the coanchor for ESPN's revered  SportsCenter . Soon, she earned respect and support for her fearless opinions and unshakable confidence, as well as a reputation as a trusted journalist who speaks her mind with truth and conviction.

Throughout  Inciting Joy , he explores how we can practice recognizing that connection, and also, crucially, how we expand it.  In \"We Kin\" he thinks about the garden (especially around August, when the zucchini and tomatoes come on) as a laboratory of mutual aid; in \"Share Your Bucket\" he explores skateboarding's reclamation of public space; he considers the costs of masculinity in \"Grief Suite\"; and in \"Through My Tears I Saw,\" he recognizes what was healed in caring for his father as he was dying.  In an era when divisive voices take up so much air space,  Inciting Joy  offers a vital alternative: What might be possible if we turn our attention to what brings us together, to what we love? Full of energy, curiosity, and compassion,  Inciting Joy  is essential reading from one of our most brilliant writers. "

Growing up, Cin Fabr\u00e9 didn't know anything about the stock market. But she learned how to hustle from her immigrant parents, saving money so that one day she could escape her abusive father and poverty in the Bronx.  Through a tip from a friend, Cin pushed her way into brokerage firm VTR Capital\u2014an offshoot of Stratton Oakmont, the company where the Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, had reigned. She was shocked to find an army of young workers, mostly Black and Brown, with no real prospects for promotion sitting at phones doing the drudge work of finding investment leads for white male brokers. But she felt the pull of profit and knew she would do whatever she had to do to be successful. Pulling back the curtain on the inequities she and so many others faced,  Wolf Hustle  reveals how Cin worked grueling hours, ascending from cold caller to stockbroker, becoming the only Black woman to do so at her firm. She also discloses the excesses she took part in on 1990s Wall Street\u2014the strip clubs, the Hamptons parties, the Gucci shopping sprees\u2014while reveling in the thrill of making money.  From landing clients worth hundreds of millions to gaining, losing, then gaining back fortunes in seconds, Cin examines her years spent trading frantically and hustling successfully, grappling with what it takes to build a rich life, and, ultimately, beating Wall Street at its own game.

                "True is a probing, richly-detailed, unique biography of Jackie Robinson, one of baseball's\u2015and America's\u2015most significant figures.  For players, fans, managers, and executives, Jackie Robinson remains baseball's singular figure, the person who most profoundly extended, and continues to extend, the reach of the game. Beyond Ruth. Beyond Clemente. Beyond Aaron. Beyond the heroes of today. Now, a half-century since Robinson's death, letters come to his widow, Rachel, by the score. But Robinson's impact extended far beyond baseball: he opened the door for Black Americans to participate in other sports, and was a national figure who spoke and wrote eloquently about inequality.  True: The Four Seasons of Jackie Robinson by Kostya Kennedy is an unconventional biography, focusing on four transformative years in Robinson's athletic and public life: 1946, his first year playing in the essentially all-white minor leagues for the Montreal Royals; 1949, when he won the Most Valuable Player Award in his third season as a Brooklyn Dodger; 1956, his final season in major league baseball, when he played valiantly despite his increasing health struggles; and 1972, the year of his untimely death. Through it all, Robinson remained true to the effort and the mission, true to his convictions and contradictions.  Kennedy examines each of these years through details not reported in previous biographies, bringing them to life in vivid prose and through interviews with fans and players who witnessed his impact, as well as with Robinson's surviving family. These four crucial years offer a unique vision of Robinson as a player, a father and husband, and a civil rights hero\u2015a new window on a complex man. "

She began by cooking dinner for one in her Montmartre kitchen. Along the way, she builds Parisienne friendships, learns how to date in French, and examines what it means to be a Black American woman in Paris\u2014all while adopting the French principle of pleasure, especially when it comes to good food, and exploring what the concept of self-care really means.

The youngest of six children, Lisa grew up in a Chicago housing project where she endured sexual, religious, and emotional abuse as a little girl. A voracious reader, she graduated high school at 15 and went to work as a secretary in a downtown insurance office, became pregnant at 16 and, at 19, unexpectedly and uncharacteristically committed a violent act, stabbing and killing the father of her daughter.  Providing powerful insights into what we as a society need to learn and confront in the ongoing epidemic of mass re-incarceration, Lisa is a stunning example of an individual who through determination, knowledge, and hard work has been able to reclaim her own life. The book ends with Lisa's rousing call to action to support the people\u2014as well as the shorthanded employers\u2014who need the help, and need each other, more than ever. "

With growing fascination and heartbreak, he draws out meaning from the shadow of absence, and ultimately redefines what it means to be a family.\u201d  -\u00a0Michelle Zauner,    New York Times    bestselling author of    Crying in H Mart    and Grammy nominated musician Japanese\u00a0Breakfast  A memoir about one man's journey to connect with his musician father, ultimately re-drawing the lines that define family and race.  Throughout his adult life, whether he was opening a Seattle record store in the '90s or touring\u00a0the world as the only non-white band member in alternative rock bands, Nabil Ayers felt the shadow and legacy of his father's musical genius, and his race, everywhere.\u00a0 \u00a0 In 1971, a white, Jewish, former ballerina, chose to have a child with the famous Black jazz musician Roy Ayers,\u00a0fully expecting and agreeing that he would not be involved in the child's life. In this highly original memoir, their son, Nabil Ayers, recounts a life spent living with the aftermath of that decision, and his journey to build an identity of his own despite and in spite of his father\u2019s absence. \u00a0 Growing up, Nabil only meets his father a handful of times. But Roy\u2019s influence is strong, showing itself in Nabil\u2019s instinctual love of music, and later, in the music industry\u2014Nabil\u2019s chosen career path. By turns hopeful\u2014wanting to connect with the man who passed down his genetic predisposition for musical talent\u2014and frustrated with Roy\u2019s continued emotional distance, Nabil struggles with how much DNA can define a family\u2026 and a person. \u00a0 Unable to fully connect with Roy, Nabil ultimately discovers the existence of several half-siblings as well as a paternal ancestor who was enslaved. Following these connections, Nabil meets and befriends the descendant of the plantation owner, which, strangely, paves the way for him to make meaningful connections with extended family he never knew existed.\u00a0 \u00a0 Despite his\u00a0father's absence, Nabil, through sheer will and a drive to understand his roots, re-draws the lines that define family and race.

When the world entered pandemic lockdown in spring 2020, Robyn Maynard, influential author of  Policing Black Lives , and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, renowned artist, musician, and author of  Noopiming: The Cure for White Ladies , began writing each other letters\u2014a gesture sparked by a desire for kinship and connection in a world shattering under the intersecting crises of pandemic, police killings, and climate catastrophe. These letters soon grew into a powerful exchange about where we go from here.      Rehearsals for Living  is a captivating and visionary work\u2014part debate, part dialogue, part lively and detailed familial correspondence between two razor-sharp writers. By articulating to each other Black and Indigenous perspectives on our unprecedented here and now, and reiterating the long-disavowed histories of slavery and colonization that have brought us to this moment, Maynard and Simpson create something new: an urgent demand for a different way forward, and a poetic call to dream up other ways of ordering earthly life.

This is literally the Movement that made us and both Davids love us whole here with a creation that is as ingenious as it is soulfully sincere. Stunning.\"\u2014Kiese Laymon, author of Heavy   A dynamic family exchange that pivots between the voices of a father and son,   The Movement Made Us is a unique work of oral history and memoir, chronicling the extraordinary story of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and its living legacy embodied in Black Lives Matter. David Dennis Sr, a core architect of the movement, speaks out for the first time, swapping recollections both harrowing and joyful with David Jr, a journalist working on the front lines of change today.   Taken together, their stories paint a critical portrait of America, casting one nation's image through the lens of two individual Black men and their unique relationship. Playful and searching, anxious and restorative, fearless and driving, this intimate memoir features scenes from across David Sr's life, as he becomes involved in the movement, tries to move beyond it, and ultimately returns to it to find final solace and new sense of self\u2014revealing a survivor who travels eternally with a cabal of ghosts.   A crucial addition to Civil Rights history, The Movement Made Us is the story of a nation reckoning with change and the hopes, struggles, setbacks, and triumphs of modern Black life. This is it: the extant chronicle of why we live, why we move, and for what we are made. "

At the time, Parkrose High School was in the middle of a 23-game losing streak\u2014they were the ultimate underdogs. In many ways, the road to Parkrose was paved by Keanon's life-defining experiences\u2013\u2013from a childhood spent dodging racist bullies and finding the support and mentorship he craved on the football team, to an NFL season where he worked closely with Colin Kaepernick as he evolved his sideline protest. Keanon was drawn to the young men on the Parkrose team, and to the school itself. After two years, he pushed them to become conference champions, mentoring countless players along the way. But still, there was that nagging sense that his calling wasn't meant to stop there. He was at that school for a reason. In May 2019, he got his answer when a 19-year-old student entered a Parkrose classroom with a trench coat and shotgun. Keanon disarmed him and pulled the boy into a hug, telling him he cared. In the boy, Keanon saw himself, and the young men he grew up with or mentored along the way\u2013\u2013and weren't so many of them just looking for acceptance, for comfort, for love? With the heart of favorite football classics\u2013\u2013 The Blindside ,  Friday Night Lights ,  Remember the Titans \u2013\u2013Keanon's journey at Parkrose is the true account of a life spent striving forward, even when faced with the unimaginable.

                "Friends and family knew Henry Louis Aaron as quick-witted, hilarious, and fiercely opinionated beyond what was shown in public. With the encouragement of Aaron's family, Terence Moore now reveals this heartfelt portrait of Hank Aaron, featuring nearly 40 years of stories plus never-before-told insights from the home run king. You'll see his wisdom. You'll see his foresight. You'll see his humor. You'll see his anger. You'll see his humanity. You'll see Aaron as you've never seen him before. Aaron not only battled racism during his playing days, but also during his days as a front office executive. The Hall of Famer shared this with Moore, who experienced his own strife at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as the first Black sports columnist ever in the Deep South. The two leaned on each other while developing a tight relationship, and Moore became The Hank Aaron Whisperer whenever the baseball great wanted to convey messages to the public. The Real Hank Aaron captures the icon's contagious laugh and pointed views, from the depth of his admiration for Jackie Robinson to his true thoughts on Barry Bonds and the steroid era. Featuring Aaron's views on race, politics, media, and sports fandom, this is a charming and illuminating glimpse at the man outside the spotlight. It's an intimate perspective on the baseball legend, the culmination of decades of friendship and correspondence. "

Joseph's critiques of \"the patriarchy... both overt and ingrained\" are razor-sharp, but it's the clear-eyed reckoning of his own place within it that tethers the soul of his book.\" \u2014Publishers Weekly    \"Joseph has learned a great deal from bell hooks here, and I think she would be proud because Patriarchy Blues is such a moving, inspiring, rigorous vision for living.\" \u2014Robert Jones, Jr., New York Times bestselling author of The Prophets    In this personal and poignant collection, the author of the New York Times bestseller The Black Friend examines the culture of masculinity through the lens of a Black man.    What does it mean to be a man today? How does the pervasive yet elusive idea of \"toxic masculinity\" actually reflect men's experiences\u2014particularly those of color\u2014and how they navigate the world?  In this thought-provoking collection of essays, poems, and short reflections, Frederick Joseph contemplates these questions and more as he explores issues of masculinity and patriarchy from both a personal and cultural standpoint. From fatherhood, and \"manning up\" to abuse and therapy, he fearlessly and thoughtfully tackles the complex realities of men's lives today and their significance for society, lending his insights as a Black man.  Written in Joseph's unique voice, with an intelligence and raw honesty that demonstrates both his vulnerability and compassion, Patriarchy Blues forces us to consider the joys, pains, and destructive nature of manhood and the stereotypes it engenders.

                "Daphne A. Brooks explores more than a century of music archives to examine the critics, collectors, and listeners who have determined perceptions of Black women on stage and in the recording studio. How is it possible, she asks, that iconic artists such as Aretha Franklin and Beyonce exist simultaneously at the center and on the fringe of the culture industry? Liner Notes for the Revolution offers a startling new perspective on these acclaimed figures-a perspective informed by the overlooked contributions of other Black women concerned with the work of their musical peers. Zora Neale Hurston appears as a sound archivist and a performer, Lorraine Hansberry as a queer Black feminist critic of modern culture, and Pauline Hopkins as America's first Black female cultural commentator. Brooks tackles the complicated racial politics of blues music recording, song collecting, and rock and roll criticism. She makes lyrical forays into the blues pioneers Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith, as well as fans who became critics, like the record-label entrepreneur and writer Rosetta Reitz. In the twenty-first century, pop superstar Janelle Monae's liner notes are recognized for their innovations, while celebrated singers Cecile McLorin Salvant, Rhiannon Giddens, and Valerie June take their place as cultural historians.

                "This program is read by the author, Will Jawando, who has been called \"the progressive leader we need\" by the late congressman John Lewis. \"Will Jawando's account of mentorship, service, and healing lays waste to the racist stereotype of the absent Black father. By arguing that Black fathers are not just found in individual families, but are indeed the treasure of entire Black communities, Will makes the case for a bold idea: that Black men can counter racist ideas and policies by virtue of their presence in the lives of Black boys and young men. This is a story we need to hear.\" \u2014Ibram X. Kendi,  New York Times\u2013 bestselling author of  How to be an Antiracist   Will Jawando tells a deeply affirmative story of hope and respect for men of color at a time when Black men are routinely stigmatized. As a boy growing up outside DC, Will, who went by his Nigerian name, Yemi, was shunted from school to school, never quite fitting in. He was a Black kid with a divorced white mother, a frayed relationship with his biological father, and teachers who scolded him for being disruptive in class and on the playground. Eventually, he became close to Kalfani, a kid he looked up to on the basketball court. Years after he got the call telling him that Kalfani was dead, another sickening casualty of gun violence, Will looks back on the relationships with an extraordinary series of mentors that enabled him to thrive. Among them were Mr. Williams, the rare Black male grade school teacher, who found a way to bolster Will's self-esteem when he discovered he was being bullied; Jay Fletcher, the openly gay colleague of his mother who got him off junk food and took him to his first play; Mr. Holmes, the high school coach and chorus director who saw him through a crushing disappointment; Deen Sanwoola, the businessman who helped him bridge the gap between his American upbringing and his Nigerian heritage, eventually leading to a dramatic reconciliation with his biological father; and President Barack Obama, who made Will his associate director of public engagement at the White House\u2014and who invited him to play basketball on more than one occasion. Without the influence of these men, Will knows he would not be who he is today: a civil rights and education policy attorney, a civic leader, a husband, and a father. Drawing on Will's inspiring personal story and involvement in My Brother's Keeper, President Obama's national initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color,  My Seven Black Fathers  offers a transformative way for Black men to shape the next generation.

Twenty years after receiving his first basketball as a toddler, he stood proud\u2014at five-foot-three\u2014as the starting point guard for the Charlotte Hornets in the NBA. From the East Baltimore playground courts where he earned his nickname by muggin' opponents for possession of the ball to Dunbar High School where he excelled alongside future NBA players, Bogues set the tone in his early years for the great heights he'd reach professionally. In this new autobiography, Bogues delves deep into his life and career, reflecting on legendary battles with Michael Jordan, John Stockton, and other generational stars of '80s and '90s hoops. He shares far-ranging anecdotes from playoff runs in Charlotte, filming Space Jam, and even watching a young Steph Curry grow up. Conversational and clear-sighted, this is a story of uncompromising vision and fleet-footed determination during a golden era for the NBA. "

                "A trusted grief expert shares what  Kirkus Reviews  praises as \"calm, lucid prose... [a] humanizing exploration of coping with the life-changing tides of loss.\"     In Grief is Love , author Marisa Renee Lee reveals that healing does not mean moving on after losing a loved one  \u2014  healing means learning to acknowledge and create space for your grief. It is about learning to love the one you lost with the same depth, passion, joy, and commitment you did when they were alive, perhaps even more. She guides you through the pain of grief\u2014whether you've lost the person recently or long ago\u2014and shows you what it looks like to honor your loss on your unique terms, and debunks the idea of a grief stages or timelines.  Grief is Love  is about making space for the transformation that a significant loss requires. In beautiful, compassionate prose, Lee elegantly offers wisdom about what it means to authentically and defiantly claim space for grief's complicated feelings and emotions. And Lee is no stranger to grief herself, she shares her journey after losing her mother, a pregnancy, and, most recently, a cousin to the COVID-19 pandemic. These losses transformed her life and led her to question what grief really is and what healing actually looks like. In this book, she also explores the unique impact of grief on Black people and reveals the key factors that proper healing requires: permission, care, feeling, grace and more. The transformation we each undergo after loss is the indelible imprint of the people we love on our lives, which is the true definition of legacy. At its core,  Grief is Love  explores what comes after death, and shows us that if we are able to own and honor what we've lost, we can experience a beautiful and joyful life in the midst of grief. "

As young boys, Paci and his brother slept in the woods on nights when the shooting and violence grew too intense; they hid in tall grass and watched as military units rolled in and leveled their village. Paci\u2019s extraordinary mother, one of the many inspiring beacons of light in this book, led her children\u2014and others in the village\u2014in ingenious acts of resilience through her indomitable kindness and compassion, even toward the soldiers who threatened their lives.  Drawing on his own memories and those of his family, Paci tells a story of survival in a country whose rich traditions were lost to the ravages of colonialism and ethnic strife.  Written in moving, lyrical prose,  The Tears of a Man Flow Inward  gives us an illuminating window into what it means to come of age in dark times, and an example of how, even in the midst of uncertainty, violence, and despair, light can almost always be found.

                "Celia was only fourteen years old when she was acquired by John Newsom, an aging widower and one of the most prosperous and respected citizens of Callaway County, Missouri. The pattern of sexual abuse that would mark their entire relationship began almost immediately. After purchasing Celia in a neighboring county, Newsom raped her on the journey back to his farm. He then established her in a small cabin near his house and visited her regularly. Over the next five years, Celia bore Newsom two children; meanwhile, she became involved with a slave named George and resolved at his insistence to end the relationship with her master. When Newsom refused, Celia one night struck him fatally with a club and disposed of his body in her fireplace. Her act quickly discovered, Celia was brought to trial. She received a surprisingly vigorous defense from her court-appointed attorneys. Nevertheless, the court upheld the tenets of a white social order that wielded almost total control over the lives of slaves. Celia was found guilty and hanged. Melton A. McLaurin uses Celia's story to reveal the tensions that strained the fabric of antebellum southern society. Celia's case demonstrates how one master's abuse of power over a single slave forced whites to make moral decisions about the nature of slavery. "

As he began using his artistic gifts to share his experiences and perspective, Henry was aggrieved to discover that many white Americans\u2014people he called friends and family\u2014were more interested in debating whether racism existed or whether Henry was being polite enough in the way he used his voice.  In this personal and thought-provoking book, Henry explores how the historical divides between Black people and non-Black people are expressed through our most mundane interactions, and why this struggle won\u2019t be resolved through civil discourse, diversity hires, interracial relationships, or education. What we need is a revolution, one that moves beyond symbolic progress to disrupt systems of racial violence and inequality in tangible, creative ways.  Sharing stories from his own path to activism\u2014from studying at seminary to becoming a student of nonviolent social change, from working as a praise leader to singing about social justice\u2014and connecting those experiences to lessons from successful nonviolent struggles in America and around the world, Andre Henry calls on Black people and people of color to divest from whiteness and its false promises, trust what their lived experiences tell them, and practice hope as a discipline as they work for lasting change.

Poor, Black, and raised by a single mother who had a secret. He was the child she hid in plain view from the rest of her family. Bruce would spend his youth at Chickasaw Park in Louisville\u2014Kentucky's segregated west end. He would grab the low hanging tree branches, then swing out over the Ohio River before dropping into the dangerous water below. He didn't know how to swim, but was fearless and knew to paddle quickly back to shore before the current could drag him under. This tenacity served him well, and he learned to be a risk taker early on. As an adult, he set out to just make a living\u2014to do better than Black folks who tried their best before, while making his Momma and Grandmomma proud. His journey to becoming a successful TV journalist nearly killed him, but he refused to treat himself as a victim. His role was to use his voice and example to pull others out of deep waters. The rollout for his retirement was unprecedented. Week-long on-air tributes, hour-long online tributes from corporate CEOs, former colleagues, Congressmembers, the Mayor, and the governor. After a near forty-five year career, all was deserved and expected, except for a final tribute\u2014seeing his image secretly painted on the Wall of Fame outside the iconic Ben's Chili Bowl restaurant alongside Barack and Michelle Obama, Oprah, and Dave Chappelle. No one could have imagined such an ending. Or could they? Bruce Johnson's journey is the culmination of his mother and grandmother's stories\u2014the ultimate American story of race, opportunity, and perseverance. "

Do you understand how your cardinal memories are the keys to your story development? Or how these very same memories may limit your potential? Lighten Up is more than a coming-of-age memoir. It is an in-depth look at Rodney Laney's disengagement from his cardinal memories. The book is humorous and provocative as Laney describes his journey into meditation and spirituality. Once you learn how to release the negative emotions attached to the images in your mind, you'll free yourself from the habitual thoughts and emotions that cause your circular and limiting behavior. And once you release the emotions weighing you down, you'll actually feel lighter. And maybe your stories will be funnier, as well. "

Laura Coates bleeds for justice on the page. \"  \u2014Ibram X. Kendi, National Book Award\u2013winning author of  Stamped from the Beginning  and  How to Be an Antiracist   When Laura Coates joined the Department of Justice as a prosecutor, she wanted to advocate for the most vulnerable among us. But she quickly realized that even with the best intentions, \"the pursuit of justice creates injustice.\"   Through Coates's experiences, we see that no matter how fair you try to fight, being Black, a woman, and a mother are identities often at odds in the justice system. She and her colleagues face seemingly impossible situations as they teeter between what is right and what is just.   On the front lines of our legal system, Coates saw how Black communities are policed differently; Black cases are prosecuted differently; Black defendants are judged differently. How the court system seems to be the one place where minorities are overrepresented, an unrelenting parade of Black and Brown defendants in numbers that belie their percentage in the population and overfill American prisons. She also witnessed how others in the system either abused power or were abused by it\u2014for example, when an undocumented witness was arrested by ICE, when a white colleague taught Coates how to unfairly interrogate a young Black defendant, or when a judge victim-blamed a young sexual assault survivor based on her courtroom attire.   Through these revelatory and captivating scenes from the courtroom, Laura Coates explores the tension between the idealism of the law and the reality of working within the parameters of our flawed legal system, exposing the chasm between what is right and what is lawful.

When Tracey M. Lewis-Giggetts wrote an essay on Black joy for  The   Washington Post , she had no idea just how deeply it would resonate. But the outpouring of positive responses affirmed her own lived experience: that Black joy is not just a weapon of resistance, it is a tool for resilience.    With this book, Tracey aims to gift her community with a collection of lyrical essays about the way joy has evolved, even in the midst of trauma, in her own life. Detailing these instances of joy in the context of Black culture allows us to recognize the power of Black joy as a resource to draw upon, and to challenge the one-note narratives of Black life as solely comprised of trauma and hardship.    \"Lewis-Giggetts etches a stunning personal map that follows in her ancestors' footsteps and highlights their ability to take control of situational heartbreak and tragedy and make something better out of it....A simultaneously gorgeous and heartbreaking read\" ( Kirkus Reviews , starred review).

Persephone's Children chronicles Rowan McCandless's odyssey as a Black, biracial woman escaping the stranglehold of a long-term abusive relationship. Through a series of thematically linked and structurally inventive essays, McCandless explores the fraught and fragmented relationship between memory and trauma. Multiple mythologies emerge to bind legacy and loss, motherhood and daughterhood, racism and intergenerational trauma, mental illness and resiliency. It is only in the aftermath that she can begin to see the patterns in her history, hear the echoes of oppression passed down from unknown, unnamed ancestors, and discover her worth and right to exist in the world.

D. Jakes   Michael Phillips would never become anything. At least, that\u2019s what he was told. It seemed like everyone was waiting for him to just fall through the cracks. After losing his father, suffering a life-altering car accident, and losing his college scholarship, Michael turned to selling drugs to make ends meet. But when his house was raided, he was arrested and thrown into a living nightmare.  When it looked like he would be sentenced to spend years behind bars, the judge gave him a choice\u2014go to a special college program for adjudicated youth or face the possibility of a thirty-year prison sentence. It wasn\u2019t hard to pick. From that choice, a mission was born\u2014to help change the system that shuffles so many young Black men like Michael straight from school to prison. Today, Michael is the pastor of a thriving church, a local leader in Baltimore, and a member of the Maryland State Board of Education. He discovered that education was the path to becoming who he was created to be.   Armed with research, statistics, and his powerful story, Michael tackles the embedded privilege of the education system and introduces ideas for change that could level the playing field and reduce negative impacts on vulnerable youth. He explores ways in which the readers can help advocate and provide resources for students, and points us to the one thing anyone can start doing, no matter who we are or what our role is: speak into young kids\u2019 lives. Tell them of their inherent worth and purpose.   In this inspiring, thought-provoking, and energizing call to action, Michael\u2019s practical steps provide a way forward to anyone wanting to help create space for collateral hope in the lives of for young people around them.

With his first son, Jay, born shortly after Senghor was incarcerated for second-degree murder, he experienced the regret of his own mistakes and the disconnection caused by a society that sees Black lives as disposable. With his second, Sekou, born after Senghor's release, he has experienced healing, transformation, intimacy, and the possibilities of a world where men and boys can openly show one another affection, support, and love.  In this collection of beautifully written letters to Jay and Sekou, Senghor traces his journey as a Black man in America and unpacks the toxic and misguided messages about masculinity, mental health, love, and success that boys learn from an early age. He issues a passionate call to all fathers and sons\u2014fathers who don't know how to show their sons love, sons who are navigating a fatherless world, boys who have been forced to grow up before their time\u2014to cultivate positive relationships with other men, seek healing, tend to mental health, grow from pain, and rewrite the story that has been told about them.   Letters to the Sons of Society  is a soulful examination of the bond between father and sons, and a touchstone for anyone seeking a kinder, more just world. "

                "One of the most successful Black businessmen in the country, who has led Nike's Jordan Brand from a $200M sneaker company to a $4B global apparel juggernaut, tells the remarkable story of his rise from gangland violence to the pinnacles of international business.   Jump tells Larry Miller's journey from the violent streets of West Philly in the 1960s to the highest echelons of American sports and industry. Miller wound up in jail more than once, especially as a teenager. But he immersed himself in the educational opportunities, eventually took advantage of a Pennsylvania state education-release program offered to incarcerated people, and was able to graduate with honors from Temple University.  When revealing his gangland past caused him to lose his first major job opportunity, Miller vowed to keep it a secret. He climbed the corporate ladder with a number of companies such as Kraft Foods, Campbell's Soup, and Jantzen, until Nike hired him to run its domestic apparel operations. Around the time of   Michael Jordan's basketball retirement, Nike Chairman Phil Knight made Larry Miller president   of the newly formed Jordan Brand. In 2007 Paul Allen convinced Miller to jump to the NBA to become president of the Portland Trailblazers, one of the first African-Americans to lead a professional sports team, before returning to Jordan Brand in 2012.  All along, Miller lived two lives: the secret of his violent past haunted him, invading his days with migraines and his sleep with nightmares of getting hauled back to   jail.   More than a rags-to-riches story, Jump is also a passionate appeal for criminal justice reform and expanded educational opportunities for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people across the United States. Drawing on his powerful personal story, as well as his vast and well-connected network, Miller plans to use Jump as a launching point to help expand such opportunities and to provide an aspirational journey for those who need hope.

Born into poverty in Shreveport, Louisiana in the 1940s, Richard Williams was blessed by a strong, caring mother who remained his lifelong hero, just as he became a hero to Venus and Serena. From the beginning of his life, Richard's mother taught him to live by the principles of courage, confidence, commitment, faith, and love. He passed the same qualities on to his daughters, who grew up loving their father and valuing the lessons he taught them. \"I still feel really close to my father,\" says Serena. \"We have a great relationship. There is an appreciation. There is a closeness because of what we've been through together, and a respect.\"   A self-made man, Williams has walked a long, hard, exciting, and ultimately rewarding road during his life, surmounting many challenges to raise a loving family and two of the greatest tennis players who ever lived.  Black and White  is the extraordinary story of that journey and the indomitable spirit that made it all possible. "

He recorded over 200 albums with his Arkestra, which, dressed in Egypto-space costumes, played everything from boogie-woogie and swing to fusion and free jazz. John Szwed's Space is the Place is the definitive biography of this musical polymath, who was one of the twentieth century's greatest avant-garde artists and intellectuals. Charting the whole of Sun Ra's life and career, Szwed outlines how after years in Chicago as a blues and swing band pianist, Sun Ra set out in the 1950s to impart his views about the galaxy, black people, and spiritual matters by performing music with the Arkestra that was as vital and innovative as it was mercurial and confounding. Szwed's listeners-whether they are just discovering Sun Ra or are among the legion of poets, artists, intellectuals, and musicians who consider him a spiritual godfather-will find that, indeed, space is the place.

Gayle Jessup White had long heard the stories passed down from her father's family, that they were direct descendants of Thomas Jefferson\u2014lore she firmly believed, though others did not. For four decades the acclaimed journalist and genealogy enthusiast researched her connection to Thomas Jefferson, to confirm its truth once and for all.   After she was named a Jefferson Studies Fellow, Jessup White discovered her family lore was correct. Poring through photos and documents and pursuing DNA evidence, she learned that not only was she a descendant of Jefferson on his father's side; she was also the great-great-great-granddaughter of Peter Hemings, Sally Hemings's brother.  In Reclamation she chronicles her remarkable journey to definitively understand her heritage and reclaim it, and offers a compelling portrait of what it means to be a black woman in America, to pursue the American dream, to reconcile the legacy of racism, and to ensure the nation lives up to the ideals advocated by her legendary ancestor.
