Once again, John Gierach tells the world why the pastime of fly-fishing makes so much sense\u2014except when it doesn't. In sparkling prose, with more than a touch of humor, he recalls the joys of landing that trout he's been watching for the last hour\u2014and then losing an even fatter one a little later. Joy and frustration mix in Gierach's latest appreciation of the fly-fishing life as he takes us from his home waters on the Front Range of the Rockies in Colorado to fishing meccas all over North America. From fishing lodges in Alaska to memories of the local creek in the Midwest where he grew up, Gierach reminds us about the indispensability of the natural world around us. "

                "An \"excellent\" ( The New York Times ) modern tribute to an ageless pastime, and a practical guide to the art, philosophy, and rituals of fly fishing, by an expert, lifelong angler.  In  The Optimist , David Coggins makes a case for the skills and sensibility of an enduring sport and shares the secrets, frustrations, and triumphs of the great tradition of fly fishing, which has captivated anglers worldwide.   Written in wry, wise, and keenly observed prose, each chapter focuses on a specific place, fish, and skill. Few individuals, for example, have the visual acuity required to catch the nearly invisible bonefish of the Bahamas flats. Or the patience to land the elusive Atlantic salmon, \"the fish of a thousand casts,\" in eastern Canada. Pursuing these challenges, Coggins, \"a confirmed obsessive,\" travels to one fishing paradise after another, including the great rivers of Patagonia, private chalk streams in England, remote ponds in Maine, and New York City's Jamaica Bay. In each setting, he chronicles his fortunes and misfortunes with honesty and humor while meditating on how fishing teaches focus, inner stillness, and a connection to the natural world.   Perfect for the novice, the enthusiastic amateur, and the devoted angler alike,  The Optimist  offers a practical path to enlightenment while providing \"a rueful, thoughtful, and very funny examination of an elegant obsession\" (Jay McInerney).

Bushcraft covers all areas of survival and camping activities: making ropes and cords, building huts, camp craft, finding food and water, making maps, starting fires, tying knots, and fashioning hunting and trapping gear-virtually every technique required to stay alive in the woods. With over 400 black-and-white illustrations and photographs, this book explains how to make use of natural materials found locally in any area, conserving instead of destroying native flora and fauna. It describes many of the skills used by primitive man, adding to these the skills necessary for modern man's survival, such as methods for determining time and direction. Bushcraft is a clear, accurate, and reliable resource for anyone who wishes to face nature on its own terms with just a knife and this book. 430 b/w illustrations. "

                "Pinned between the mountains and the sea, on a steeply-sloped crescent of land stretching from the French border to Tuscany, more than half of Liguria (better known as the Italian Riviera), is protected park land. The inland towns are some of the most interesting in Liguria, both for their history and their gorgeous settings amid the forests, valleys, and peaks of the Apennine Mountains. The hiking here is fantastic. In addition to the major city of Genoa, you ll find the gorgeous coastal cities of Camogli, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sestri Levante, and Portovenere, plus enchanting Portofino, a mecca for the beautiful people. San Remo as well, home of the famous Music Festival. The author, who has long spent several months here each year, takes you through every town and region as you explore the Roman ruins, the artists workshops, feudal castles, and the ancient paths that still connect the villages. The scent of herbs and pines, the startling blue of the sea. Brilliant white cliffs tumbling into the depths. Pounding surf and chiming church bells. Mountain peaks that break the clouds. Here is the most detailed guide to the Italian Riviera, also known as Liguria. Liguria stretches from the French border to Tuscany. Backed by the Apennine Mountains, small villages dot the hillsides, perch on mountain peaks, and line the valleys. Seaside towns include Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure and San Remo. Genoa, the sophisticated metropolis, abounds with history and culture. We tell you what you must not miss: The olive oil, the black truffles, the wines and cheeses. Pesto sauce, made of fresh basil, garlic, olive oil, cheese and pinenuts. Pizza dell'Andrea, named for Andrea Doria, the 16th-century Neapolitan admiral. It was his favorite and is still popular. Shrimp, scallops, lobster, clams, mussels and squid are all on the menus. Hike the ancient trails between the villages. Prowl the medieval streets of Genoa. Explore the feudal castles and Roman ruins. Shop in the antique markets and artists's studios. Here is practical advice on when to go, where to go, transportation, currency, climate, history, business hours, medical care, banking, staying safe, plus all the hotels and restaurants worth your attention. A detailed guide to every aspect of the destination: history, culture, foods, restaurants, hotels, sightseeing, things to do - written by an author who knows the place intimately. Here is practical advice on when to go, where to go, transportation, currency, climate, history, business hours, medical care, banking, staying safe, plus all the hotels and restaurants worth your attention. An earlier version of this guide was justly criticized because it lacked a hyperlinked table of contents. That problem has now been solved so you can click on any topic listed and it will take you to that section of the book. "

                "The author draws from her many years of experience living in the south of France to tell you about the people, their culture and the way of life. Covering every town, village and city in the region, this book takes you sightseeing in Avignon, shopping in Marseilles, to the best beaches at Cap d'Antibes and along the French Riviera to places like Eze, Nice, Monte Carlo and Cap Ferrat. Comprehensive background information - history, culture, geography and climate - gives you a solid knowledge of each destination and its people. Regional chapters take you on an introductory tour, with stops at museums, historic sites and local attractions. Places to stay and eat; transportation to, from and around your destination; practical concerns; tourism contacts - it's all here! Detailed regional and town maps feature walking and driving tours. \"This guide offers plenty of practical information for the visitor who wants to explore the region. It includes info on places to stay and eat, but that isn't its strongest point. Its best features are the adventure tips it provides for each area (boating, biking, walking, kayaking, windsurfing, you name it!) and the pertinent background information that adds depth to a visit: for example, a note about French author Antoine de St Exup\u00e9ry when covering Agay, a word about Winter on the Mont Ventoux. These fall outside of the classic insights on these locations. \"As a frequent and long-time visitor to the region, I find the information in the guide right on the mark and recommend it highly.\" \u2014\u00a0 Florence Chatzigianis. \"I've just returned from a trip to Antibes and Nice and I used this book as my guide. The recommendations were spot on; really terrific. This is a rare thing, a guide book that inspires and tempts you without making your head spin. All the detail you need is there but this book is so much more!\" \u2014 Annie Smith. \"What a great hands-on book.This is best guide to Provence and the Riviera I've come across. Her section on St. Remy and Eygalieres is perfect. \"Le Petit Bru\" may have been the best meal I had...and a good value. This is the one to get before you leave.\" \u2014 Chuck E. \"This guidebook features just the kind of soft adventures I enjoy: hiking, touring and poking into the interesting recesses of a country, followed by an evening of good food and wine. The author's biography says she's been visiting Provence for 20 years and it shows in her writing, which includes all the little insider tips that you'd expect from someone with her experience. With the practical information I've found here, it may take me the next 20 years to enjoy everything this book brings to light.\" \u2014 Betsy Malloy. \"There are a lot of tour books for this region, but this new one is really fun. There is lots of information on \"out of the way\" places and interesting festivals, all sorts of things which you won't find anywhere else. I love Provence, and this book will definitely come with me the next time I go. The information is presented clearly and is well written, so it's easy to use. Lots of nice pictures, too. I like this guide a lot, and I hope to see more French guides from this writer.\" \u2014 J. Kingan. \"If you are interested in experiencing the gorgeous Cote D'Azur and Provence - not just enjoying the scenery from a tour bus or car - this is the book for you. Filled with tips on out-of-the-way places,great hikes and bike rides.\" \u2014 L. Lot. "

                "We travel to grow \u2013 our Adventure Guides show you how. Experience the places you visit more directly, freshly, intensely than you would otherwise \u2013 sometimes best done on foot, in a canoe, or through cultural adventures like art courses, cooking classes, learning the language, meeting the people, joining in the festivals and celebrations. This can make your trip life-changing, unforgettable. All of the detailed information you need is here about the hotels, restaurants, shopping, sightseeing. But we also lead you to new discoveries, turning corners you haven't turned before, helping you to interact with the world in new ways. That's what makes our Adventure Guides unique. This guide covers Alberta's Jasper National Park, Banff National Park, along with BC's amazing Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Other Rocky Mountain Parks and areas covered include Kananaskis Country, Waterton Lakes National Park and Mount Robson Provincial Park, with majestic Mt. Robson. The Canadian Rockies see about four million visitors annually. Easily accessible adventures include walking, hiking and backpacking; mountain biking and bicycle touring; fishing, boating and rafting; horseback riding; skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing; and so much more. This is a guide for places to stay and eat, sights, activities, festivals - written by a lifelong resident of the Canadian Rockies. Print edition is 400 pages. \"Having been to the Canadian Rockies numerous times and thinking we had seen all the wonderful places before we discovered this book, we now must plan many more trips there to explore all the other incredible places described in detail in this Guide. With numerous beautiful color photographs, most of which are by the author, this guide is a treasure because the scenery of the Canadian Rockies is some of the most spectacular in the world. A unique feature of this guide book is that it includes hiking details for each of the areas described. Since we have hiked many of these areas, we know this is a necessary and valuable tool for planning hikes. With each section Koller has Hikes, Drives, Sights, and Activities, so for non-hikers it is just as valuable, also giving information for booking guided tours. The Canadian Rockies have so many wonderful places to discover and some are quite hidden unless you know where to look, as you will with this guide. Everything from camping to exclusive hotels and restaurants are catalogued also.\" \u2014 Bonnie Neely (Amazon reviewer) "

Italy's northernmost zone, the Veneto includes Padua, Verona, Vicenza, plus Venice itself, which once ruled the area. Some 5,000 Renaissance villas still stand, many by Palladio. A food- and wine-lover's paradise, it's also the most artistically rich region in Italy, and the most romantic, with the art of Giotto and Mantegna in Padua, the Roman ruins in Verona, the canals and palaces in Venice itself. Bellini, Tintoretto, Veronese and Titian worked here. Experience their art and be part of their world, with the insights of an insider. Every detail is here about the foods, the sights, the best places to stay and eat. The print edition is 400 pages. "

Photos and maps. \"In planning a trip to Nova Scotia (somewhere I have never been) I used this book extensively. We enjoy hiking, kayaking and general sight-seeing. This book not only provided information on outdoor activities but also on lodging, dining and driving as well as the history of the areas in Nova Scotia. It provides a wealth of information and made our stay much more enjoyable than if we just went there not knowing anything. We brought it along and it was a very important reference for us as we toured the province. I highly recommend it. After reading several travel books, this was the best one and the only one we took on our trip.\" \u2014 DM Dugan. \"This book is excellent. What I particularly liked was that it mentioned small walks that can be taken in the areas that we visited, as well as archeological sites and wildlife viewing areas, all in my areas of interest.\" \u2014 Sheila Ferrari. \"We love eastern Canada and have traveled there many times. There are parts described in this books that we have not seen and would love to see. \" \u2014 R. Satelmajer. "

                "\"Despite the title, the book is not all rafting, rappelling and rainforests. A full 117 pages of the 386-page volume are introductory and background material covering history, culture, nature and, of course, all the nuts-and-bolts travel essentials. Useful, descriptive listings of hotels, restaurants, nightlife, shopping and, true to the title, adventure-travel options fill the remaining two-thirds of the guide. But if your adventure tastes lean toward shopping in the artisan town of Sarch\u00ed rather than scaling Chirripo you'll find recommendations too. Peppered throughout the text are quotes from literature, music and popular sayings, from everyone from Gilbert and Sullivan to Martin Luther King and The Beach Boys. All fit the text, and you'll be excused from breaking away from the travel information and thumbing through to see who the Conords will quote next. The book recommends locking your passport in your hotel safe and, when you go out, carrying a photocopy that you've made before you leave home. That advice generates much debate in travel circles, a question of balancing authorities' insistence on seeing the original document with the risk of losing it. In any case, a copy made before departure without that all-important entry stamp into the country would never suffice. But these matters are small and forgivable in a guide packed with such solid information.\" \u2014 Tico Times\u00a0\u00a0 \"I am here in Costa Rica in an internet cafe and had to take the time to tell everyone what a good book this is. It really gave us everything we needed to plan our trip and now that we are here, we use it to find just about everything. If you have not visited Costa Rica yet, get a copy of this book and come on down \u2014 it is fabulous. PURA VIDA!\" \u2014 Ramon Vallarino\u00a0\u00a0 \"My husband and I just spent our honeymoon in Costa Rica and believe it or not, found this Adventure Guide to be the best resource for exciting things to do and see. It was also accurate for finding hotels that had that little bit of extra ambiance we wanted for romance. We had used Lonely Planet guidebooks on other trips but found this guidebook to be much better. It's easy to use, has lovely photographs, and for rainy nights it made good armchair reading. I heartily recommend the Adventure Guide for a wonderful vacation in Costa Rica.\" \u2014 Amazon customer\u00a0\u00a0 \"My fiancee and I went to Costa Rica and wanted to get away from everything. This book led us to Uvita de Osa (not even mentioned in other books). This book gave us great local information and helped us plan our vacation form start to finish. Hint: If you are travelling cheap and want a hand getting started in Costa Rica, call John at Safe Passage (costaricabustickets.com). You won't regret it!\" \u2014 Eric B. Wolf\u00a0\u00a0 Written by the authors of our award-winning Yucatan Adventure Guide, this book offers comprehensive coverage of Costa Rica and its people. Travel to the major national parks and preserves; hike in rain forests. Explore the country's vibrant history, culture and wildlife. Firsthand advice on travel in the country's various environments \u2014 mountain, jungle, beach, city. Plant and animal life, archeology, history, attractions on and off the regular tourist path.

                "\"If your pictures aren't good enough, you aren't close enough.\" \u2013Robert Capa Robert Capa and Gerda Taro were young Jewish refugees, idealistic and in love. As photographers in the 1930s, they set off to capture their generation's most important struggle\u2014the fight against fascism. Among the first to depict modern warfare, Capa, Taro, and their friend Chim took powerful photographs of the Spanish Civil War that went straight from the action to news magazines. They brought a human face to war with their iconic shots of a loving couple resting, a wary orphan, and, always, more and more refugees\u2014people driven from their homes by bombs, guns, and planes. Today, our screens are flooded with images from around the world. But Capa and Taro were pioneers, bringing home the crises and dramas of their time\u2014and helping give birth to the idea of bearing witness through technology. With a cast of characters ranging from Langston Hughes and George Orwell to Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway, and packed with dramatic photos, posters, and cinematic magazine layouts, here is Capa and Taro's riveting, tragic, and ultimately inspiring story. This thoroughly-researched and documented book can be worked into multiple aspects of the common core curriculum. "

This guide shows you how to discover them all: Plush resorts on the coast and islands, Greek and Roman excavations, plus street theater and musical performances everywhere. The dramatic Sorrento and Amalfi coasts. Capri, where Roman emperors Nero and Hadrian had their getaway villas. You can still visit them today. Positano, the most photographed fishing village in the world, clinging to a rock above the sea. The excavated Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, the ancient villas at Stabia and Oplontis and superlative Greek temples at Paestum. The volcanic hissing beaches and bubbling spas on Ischia, sulphur-laden fumaroles at Pozzuoli, and the sublime Mt. Vesuvius, with its verdant slopes, craggy craters and majestic tides of lava. The superb gastronomic specialties of Campania are everywhere: mouth-watering pizza (invented here), handmade pasta and sophisticated seafood. The author shows you how to experience Naples & the Bay intensely and unforgettably, while providing details about the foods, the sights, the many unforgettable walks and hikes, the best places to stay (whether you want a charming B&B, a 16th-century palazzo or a luxurious spa) and restaurants all with the insight of an insider.

The German Navy was a  fearsome superpower during WWII , and perhaps the crown jewel in its attack fleet was the juggernaut named  Bismarck .  This 41,000-ton behemoth was crewed by nearly 2,000 soldiers, over 100 officers, and boasted  four weapons batteries  and  two anti-aircraft guns . Not to mention over  forty other mounted guns , space for multiple  floatplanes , and an  aircraft catapult ; The Bismarck was a serious threat to Allied Forces on the water.  In May 1941,  Bismarck broke out into the North Atlantic , threatening the transatlantic shipping lanes that were vital to Britain's survival. This is the gripping tale of the Royal Navy's hunt for the  most powerful sea raider in history .\u00a0This incredible history documents the  tireless search , and  unlikely defeat  of this mighty ship.

If only a handful of people had ever experienced the Third Man, it might be dismissed as an unusual delusion shared by a few overstressed minds. But the amazing thing is this: over the years, the experience has occurred again and again, to mountaineers, divers, polar explorers, prisoners of war, solo sailors, aviators, astronauts and 9/11 survivors. All have escaped traumatic events only to tell strikingly similar stories of having experienced the close presence of a helper or guardian. The mysterious force has been explained as everything from hallucination to divine intervention. Recent neurological research suggests something else. In The Third Man Factor John Geiger combines history, scientific analysis and great adventure stories to explain this secret to survival, a Third Man who - in the words of legendary Italian climber Reinhold Messner - 'leads you out of the impossible.'

In 1897, whaling in the Arctic waters off Alaska's coast was as dangerous as it was lucrative. And in that particular year, winter blasted early, bringing storms and ice packs that caught eight American whale ships and three hundred sailors off guard. Their ships locked in ice, with no means of escape, the whalers had limited provisions on board, and little hope of surviving until warmer temperatures arrived many months later. Here is the incredible story of three men sent by President McKinley to rescue them. The mission? A perilous trek over 1,500 miles of nearly impassable Alaskan terrain, in the bone-chilling months of winter, to secure two herds of reindeer (for food) and find a way to guide them to the whalers before they starve.

The richness in culture is demonstrated in the theater, cinema and art found everywhere. The coastal towns, the Mafia, the wines and foods, the astonishing history - all are explored in this guidebook. Included are the Tyrrhenian coast, which runs the length of Sicily's northern shore; the Aeolian Islands, with their steaming volcanoes, mud baths, crystal-clear waters and beaches; the Ionian coast, with its stunning sea views, woodlands, spectacular gorges and numerous old towns. The cities are not forgotten. Palermo, the capital, is described as \"modern-day anarchy,\" but it's an anarchy you'll fall in love with. Siracusa was once the cradle of Greek civilization in Italy and a rival to Athens as the most important city in the Western world. The archaeological treasures here date back 2,700 years.

                "Color photos and maps throughout the guide.  The author has lived in Nicaragua part-time for many years.  Bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Caribbean Sea on the east, Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America, but tourists are only now beginning to discover it. As a result, the abundant beaches are uncrowded and the rainforests are filled with wildlife \u2013 including 700 species of birds, white faced capuchin monkeys, spider monkeys, and howler monkeys.   Central America\u2019s largest lake, Lago de Nicaragua, is here, as is Granada, the oldest Spanish city in the continental Americas, with the earliest colonial buildings. The Pacific Lowlands region, which includes the cities of Managua, Le\u00f3n, Granada, and San Juan del Sur, is dotted with some 40 volcanoes.   Local markets and festivals offer glimpses into traditional rural life. Artisan communities can be visited around the country, and the author shows you how. Nicaragua is known for its unique pottery, hammocks, Primitivist paintings and wood carvings. It is often possible to meet the artisans themselves.   All the local foods and where to get them are detailed, from vigorones (beans, rice, cabbage salad, and pork, steamed in a banana leaf), to sweet fried plantains, and tamales, coco bread, and plentiful fresh seafood. Many large coffee plantations are here where you can stay and quickly become fluent in Spanish. Learn all the details.  Explore the jungles, climb the many volcanoes, swim in their craters, scuba and snorkel the reefs of the Caribbean or the Pacific coast, fish for tarpon. Every adventure is covered \u2013 where to do it and how.  Visit some of the more than 300 islands offshore that make up Las Isletas. Or try snorkeling, diving, fishing, and relaxing on the spectacular white sand beaches of the Corn Islands.   The recommended places to stay and eat in each price range are thoroughly covered, based on personal visits and in most cases illustrated with color photos. "

I wasn't disappointed - there's masses of extra information here that many other guidebooks just don't have, and all of the lakes are covered, plus day trips to nearby towns, etc. Good variety of hotel and restaurants - not just for those with big budgets. I particularly like the listing and addresses for the adventures - which include anything from diving schools, bike and boat hire thro to art courses. The book doesn't seem quite as glossy as some other titles but the content is great - and clearly written by somebody who knows the region well. Maps are good too - including Milan metro map!\" \u2014 Amazon reviewer. "

                "These unspoiled islands lie at the southern end of the Caribbean chain and are just now being discovered by tourists. St. Vincent, with the oldest botanical garden in the Americas, is dominated by a huge volcano, its peak usually hidden in clouds. The Grenadines include Bequia, Mustigue, Mayreau and many other islands, each one a unique gem. Grenada, with its pristine reefs, is the source for a third of the world's nutmeg; the smell of spices is everywhere in the air. This guide is the best preparation for a visit to these islands, with full details on accommodations and restaurants, getting around, sightseeing, climate, history and geography. Activities covered include sailing, fishing, kayaking, diving, hiking, horseback riding and shopping.  The book covers Grenada, St. Vincent, Bequia, Mustique, Canouan, Tobago Cays, Mayreau, Union Island, Palm Island, Petit St. Vincent, Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Color throughout. "

                "Here is a welcome new addition to this acclaimed travel guide series: \"Pocket Adventures Germany\" is a lightweight volume with heavyweight information designed to be used on the go. Packed with all the practical travel information you could ever need, from places to stay and eat, tourist information resources, destination specific travel advice, emergency information, plus sections on history and geography that provide readers with the background knowledge essential to a thoroughly enjoyable holiday. The author's passion for the destination comes across in the lively and detailed text, which is packed with the very best and most up-to-date information. This is a must have volume for anyone really wanting to make the most of their German holiday. Color photos throughout. The author is a resident of Munich so he knows his subject well. \"Of the three Germany guidebooks I used, this one was the most useful and not only because it covers so many places that the others simply ignored. Although you never get 10% off for showing this book, it has enough sensible advice on how to shave unnecessary expenses off the budget without ever feeling or acting like a cheapskate. I enjoyed the author's explanation of Germany's complex history but others may like the \"History Cheat Sheet\" that reduces six pages of history to a half page summary. Although the author has the ability to focus on the essentials, he (she?) drops enough fascinating tidbits to keep it interesting. I also love the explanation of major trends in German culture, arts, music, and literature. The author clearly has opinions but never treats the reader like an idiot or writes down to you in any sense. As a non-German speaker I also loved the way all German terms are translated throughout the guide not expecting me to suddenly remember what is a kirch or Schloss halfway through the book. The accommodation lists are very useful especially as it focuses on the around 80-120 per night middle to upper class hotels that suit my tastes. However, even the lower priced hotels all have private bathrooms, which to me is rather essential when on vacation.\u2014Jane S., Amazon.com Great to see a guidebook on Germany in English by an author who realizes that Germany is more than Berlin, the Rhine, and Bavaria. Not that the well-known areas are neglected but I particularly enjoyed the wide coverage on the former East German regions.\u2014Steven, Amazon.com. "

Since I was unfamiliar with the Alps, I referred to it often on my ski trip to Switzerland and France.

Millions of people every year hike into, bike, drive or climb into the green valleys and limestone mountain ridges of Hungary s national parks and the Zemplen hills. Storks, eagles, wrens, blackbirds, woodpeckers, and flocks of thousands make their home in forests, grasslands, and cliff-sides. Majestic antlered stags and deer range the forest. Fresh springs and cold clear creeks tumble down from the mountains. The author takes us there. Sitting astride the Danube, Budapest has been called the Paris of Eastern Europe and The Pearl of the Danube. There are thousands of restaurants and virtually every type of cuisine. Hotels and nightspots are just as numerous and the author guides us to the best of them all. This is the only guide illustrated with color maps and photographs throughout. Print edition is 586 pages.
