I loved this and you will, too.\u201d\u2014Mindy Kaling, author of  Why Not Me?  and  Nothing Like I Imagined   What to do when you\u2019re the perpetual new kid, only child, and military brat hustling school to school each year and everyone\u2019s looking to you for answers? Make some shit up, of course!\u00a0And a young Jay Ellis does just that, with help from his imaginary friend, Mikey. A testament to the importance of invention, trusting oneself, and making space for creativity,  Did Everyone Have an Imaginary Friend (or Just Me)?  is a memoir of a kid who confided in his imaginary sidekick to navigate parallel pop culture universes (like watching  Fresh Prince  alongside John Hughes movies or listening to Ja Rule and Dave Matthews) to a lifetime of birthday disappointment (being a Christmas-season Capricorn will do that to you) and hoop dreams gone bad. Mikey also guides Ellis through tragedies, like losing his teenage cousin in a mistaken-target drive-by and the shame and fear of being pulled over by cops almost a dozen times the year he got his driver\u2019s license. As his imaginary friend morphs into adult consciousness,\u00a0Ellis charts an unforgettable story of looking inward to solve to some of life\u2019s biggest (and smallest) challenges, told in the roast-you-with-love voice of your closest homey.

                "In this poignant, delicious memoir, American tax preparer and food writer Steve Hoffman tells the story of how he and his family move to the French countryside, where the locals upend everything he knows about food, wine, and learning how to belong.  \u00a0 Steve Hoffman is a perfectly comfortable middle-aged Minnesotan man who has always been desperately, pretentiously in love with France, more specifically with the idea of France. To follow that love, he and his family move, nearly at random, to the small, rural, scratchy-hot village of Autignac in the south of the country, and he immediately thinks he\u2019s made a terrible mistake. Life here is not holding your cigarette chest-high while walking to the caf\u00e9 and pulling off the trick of pretending to be Parisian, it\u2019s getting into fights with your wife because you won\u2019t break character and introduce your very American family to the locals, who can smell you and your perfect city-French from a mile away. \u00a0 But through cooking what the local grocer tells him to cook, he feels more of this place. A neighbor leads him into the world of winemaking, where he learns not as a pedantic oenophile, but bodily, as a grape picker and winemaker\u2019s apprentice. Along the way, he lets go of the abstract ideas he\u2019d held about France, discovering instead the beauty of a culture that is one with its landscape, and of becoming one with that culture. "

                "On his death in the autumn of 2006, Milton Friedman was lauded as \"the grandmaster of free-market economic theory in the postwar era\" by the  New York Times  and \"the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century\" by the  Economist . Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, Friedman was both a highly respected economist and a prominent public intellectual, the leader of a revolution in economic and political thought that argued robustly in favor of virtues of free markets and laissez-faire policies.  Milton Friedman on Economics: Selected Papers  collects a variety of Friedman's papers on topics in economics that were originally published in the  Journal of Political Economy . Opening with Friedman's 1977 Nobel Lecture, the volume spans nearly the whole of his career, incorporating papers from as early as 1948 and as late as 1990. An excellent introduction to Friedman's economic thought,  Milton Friedman  will be essential for anyone tracing the course of twentieth-century economics and politics. "

                "A collection of writing by Simon Reynolds, centered on music that seemed, in its moment, to prefigure the Future     Simon Reynolds's first book in eight years is a celebration of music that feels like a taste of tomorrow. Sounds that prefigure pop music's future\u2014the vanguard genres and heroic innovators whose discoveries eventually get accepted by the wider mass audience. But it's also about the way music can stir anticipation for a thrillingly transformed world just around the corner: a future that might be utopian or dystopian, but at least will be radically changed and exhilaratingly other.     Starting with an extraordinary chapter on Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer, taking in illuminating profiles of Ryuichi Sakamoto, Boards of Canada, Burial, and Daft Punk, and arguing for Auto-Tune as the defining sound of 21st century pop,  Futuromania  shapes over two dozen essays and interviews into a chronological narrative of machine-music from the 1970s to now. Reynolds explores the interface between pop music and science fiction's utopian dreams and nightmare visions, always emphasizing the quirky human individuals abusing the technology as much as the era-defining advances in electronic hardware and digital software.     A tapestry of the scenes and subcultures that have proliferated in that febrile, sexy, and contested space where man meets machine,  Futuromania  is an enthused listening guide that will propel readers towards adventures in sound. There is a lifetime of electronic listening here. "

                "Wendell Berry has never been afraid to speak up for the dispossessed. The Need to Be Whole continues the work he began in The Hidden Wound (1970) and The Unsettling of America (1977), demanding a careful exploration of this hard, shared truth: The wealth of the mighty few governing this nation has been built on the unpaid labor of others. Without historical understanding of this practice of dispossession\u2014the displacement of Native peoples, the destruction of both the land and land-based communities, ongoing racial division\u2014we are doomed to continue industrialism's assault on both the natural world and every sacred American ideal. Berry writes, \"To deal with so great a problem, the best idea may not be to go ahead in our present state of unhealth to more disease and more product development. It may be that our proper first resort should be to history: to see if the truth we need to pursue might be behind us where we have ceased to look.\" If there is hope for us, this is it: that we honestly face our past and move into a future guided by the natural laws of affection. This book furthers Mr. Berry's part in what is surely our country's most vital conversation. "

                "In her career as a science reporter, Nell Greenfieldboyce has reported from inside a space shuttle, the bottom of a coal mine, and the control room of a particle collider; she's presented news on the color of dinosaur eggs, ice worms that live on mountaintop glaciers, and signs of life on Venus. In this, her debut book, she delivers a wholly original collection of powerful, emotionally raw, and unforgettable personal essays that probe the places where science touches our lives most intimately. Expertly weaving her own experiences of motherhood and marriage with an almost devotional attention to the natural world, Greenfieldboyce grapples with the weighty dualities of life: birth and death, constancy and impermanence, memory and doubt, love and aging. She looks for a connection to the universe by embarking on a search for the otherworldly glint of a micrometeorite in the dust, consults meteorologists and storm chasers on the eerie power of tornadoes to soothe her children's anxieties, and processes her adolescent oblivion through the startling discovery of black holes. A beautiful blend of explanatory science, original reporting, and personal experience, Transient and Strange captures the ache of ordinary life, offering resonant insights into both the world around us and the worlds within us.

Epstein gives us a \"bonfire of his own vanities,\" his thoughts about why watching sports is so impossibly seductive, what it is like to be short, and why he misses smoking even decades as a health-obsessed non-smoker.

On September 11, 1999, humanity made a monumental discovery in the vastness of space. Scientists uncovered an asteroid of immense scientific importance\u2014a colossal celestial entity. As massive as an aircraft carrier and towering as high as the iconic Empire State Building, this cosmic titan was later named Bennu. Remarkable for much more than its size, Bennu belonged to a rare breed of asteroids capable of revealing the essence of life itself. But just as Bennu became a beacon of promise, researchers identified a grave danger. Hurtling through space, it threatens to collide with our planet on September 24, 2182.  Leading the expedition was Dr. Dante Lauretta, the Principal Investigator of NASA's audacious OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission. Tasked with unraveling Bennu's mysteries, his team embarked on a daring quest to retrieve a precious sample from the asteroid's surface \u2014 one that held the potential to not only unlock the secrets of life's origins but also to avert an unprecedented catastrophe.  A tale of destiny and danger,  The Asteroid Hunter  chronicles the high-stakes mission firsthand, narrated by Dr. Lauretta. It offers readers an intimate glimpse into the riveting exploits of the mission and Dr. Lauretta's wild, winding personal journey to Bennu and back. Peeling back the curtain on the wonders of the cosmos, this enthralling account promises a rare glimpse into the tightly woven fabric of scientific exploration, where technical precision converges with humanity's profound curiosity and indominable spirit.

The alternatives of having and being are basic orientations of our character and determine our behavior. The mostly unpublished and unknown texts featured in The Essential Fromm encapsulate the psychologist's views on the fulfilling life. To put down roots yet remain free is what the late Erich Fromm called the art of being. It is the secret of happiness. "

Burrillo to the desert Southwest, whose redrock landscapes were a source of stability through mental and physical illness. In The Backwoods of Everywhere, archaeologist Burrillo excavates his past, examining Indigenous and tourist cultures, the complexities of American archaeology, and what it means to be a local. From the ancient canal systems of Phoenix, Arizona, to the modern Mayan communities of the Yucatan Peninsula, to the depths of the Grand Canyon, Burrillo brings listeners on an entertaining romp chock-full of history, ecology, cultural preservation, and personal stories. In the vein of Bill Bryson, Tim Cahill, and Ellen Meloy, Burrillo's is a fresh voice in humor-spiked nature writing and cultural commentary. Running throughout the wide-ranging topics of The Backwoods of Everywhere are themes of place and locality, and how these vary between cultures and individuals. Marrying the intensely personal with the complex and technical, Burrillo's candid voice brings humor, wonder, irony, and wit to each thought-provoking essay. "

As she saw it, disorganization was one of her countless character flaws\u2014that is until she was diagnosed with ADHD at age 35. Like many girls who go undiagnosed, Emily grew up internalizing criticisms about her impulsivity and lack of follow-through. She held onto that shame as she tried (and often failed) to fit into a world designed for neurotypical brains.    I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is a personal essay collection of laugh-out-loud-funny, tear-jerking, and at times cringey true stories of Emily's experiences as a neurodivergent woman. With the newfound knowledge of her ADHD, Emily candidly reexamines her complicated relationships (including one with a celebrity stalker), her money problems, the years she spent unknowingly self-medicating, and her hyperfixations (two words: decorative baskets).     A memoir-in-essays both entertaining and enlightening,  I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is for people with ADHD, as well as those who know and love them. This is a powerful collection of deeply relatable, wide-ranging stories about a woman's right to control her own body, about overwhelm and oversharing, about drinking too much and sleeping too little, and about being misunderstood by the people closest to you. At its heart,  I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is about not quite fitting in and not really understanding why\u2014something we've all felt whether we're neurodivergent or not. "

His writing is refreshing, erudite, joyful. Indiana champions shining examples of literary and artistic merit regardless of whether the individual artist or writer is famous; asserts a standard of care and tradition that has nothing to do with the ivory tower establishment; is unafraid to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce when someone needs to say the emperor has no clothes; speaks in the same breath-in the same discerning, insolent, eloquent way-about high art and pop culture. Few writers could get away with saying the things Gary Indiana does. And when the writing is this good, it's also political, plus it's a riot of fun. "

Dennett, philosopher and cognitive scientist, has spent his career considering consciousness.  I've Been Thinking  traces the development of Dennett's own intellect and instructs us how we too can become good thinkers. Dennett's restless curiosity leads him from his childhood in Beirut to Harvard, and from Parisian jazz clubs to 'tillosophy' on his tractor in Maine. Along the way, he encounters and debates with a host of legendary thinkers, and reveals the breakthroughs and misjudgments that shaped his paradigm-shifting philosophies. Thinking, Dennett argues, is hard, and risky. In fact, all good philosophical thinking is inevitably accompanied by bafflement, frustration and self-doubt. It is only in getting it wrong that we, very occasionally, find a way to get it right. This memoir by one of the greatest philosophers of our time will speak to anyone who seeks a life of the mind with adventure and creativity. \u00a92023 Daniel C. Dennett (P)2023 Penguin Audio. "

The 1990s were a chaotic and gritty and utterly magical time for music, a confounding barrage of genres and lifestyles and superstars, from grunge to hip-hop, from sumptuous R&B to rambunctious ska-punk, from Axl to Kurt to Missy to Santana to Tupac to Britney. In 60 SONGS THAT EXPLAIN THE '90s,  Ringer  music critic Rob Harvilla reimagines all the earwormy, iconic hits Gen Xers pine for with vivid historical storytelling, sharp critical analysis, rampant loopiness, and wryly personal ruminations on the most bizarre, joyous, and inescapable songs from a decade we both regret entirely and miss desperately.

                "From New York Times bestselling author Naomi Wolf, Facing the Beast is a devastating, detailed account of wrongthink, deplatforming, and an unexpected political, personal, and spiritual transformation that followed during one of the most divisive times in American history. In this uncompromising investigation into today's most urgent issues, Naomi Wolf uses her own wildly politicized pilgrimage\u2014from New York Times bestselling author and high-level Democratic consultant to a journalist cast out from the elite political and social circles she once moved through\u2014as a stunning narrative framework that is both chilling and incisive. Wolf's sin? Doing the job that good journalists once prided themselves on: asking questions, challenging authority, and, during one of the most politically divisive moments in modern history, exposing the many failures of the public health response during the COVID-19 pandemic by chronicling the dangerous descent of our democracy into tyranny, censorship, and totalitarianism. Unable to remain silent in the shadows and unwilling to collude with the mainstream, Wolf bravely covers topics that few other writers dare to address critically for fear of being deplatformed. Facing the Beast explores reproductive rights, medical freedom, the uncurious thought-policing of the \"progressive\" left, the Second Amendment, the criminal relationship between the FDA and Pfizer\u2014Wolf's clear writing repeatedly shines light in the dark corners of our fractured society. A decades-long champion of free speech, freedom of the press, and the Constitution, Wolf found herself not only in the midst of a political rebirth but a spiritual transformation as well\u2014one in which the events of the day could only be described in terms of good, evil, and a metaphysical quest on the nature of reality. For readers of Matt Taibbi, Glenn Greenwald, and Bari Weiss, Facing the Beast is a fearless indictment of legacy media and the political class, as well as a brutal reminder that searching for and defending the truth can be dangerous.

Born Deaf into an ASL-speaking family and blind by adolescence, John Lee Clark learned to embrace the possibilities of his tactile world. He is on the frontlines of the Protactile movement, which gave birth to an unprecedented tactile language and a way of life based on physical connection. In a series of paradigm-shifting essays, Clark reports on seismic developments within the DeafBlind community. In \"Against Access,\" he interrogates the prevailing advocacy for \"accessibility\" that recreates a shadow of a hearing-sighted experience. In the National Magazine Award-winning \"Tactile Art,\" he describes his relationship to visual art and encounters with tactile sculpture. He advocates for \"Co-Navigation,\" a new way of guiding that respects DeafBlind agency and offers a brief history of the term \"DeafBlind.\" As warm and witty as he is radical and inspiring, Clark welcomes listeners into the exciting Protactile landscape and celebrates the hidden knowledge that can be gained through touch.

                "A poignant and moving memoir-in-essays from stand-up comedian Aida Rodriguez on the power of overcoming hardship and transforming pain into laughter.   Aida Rodriguez has, to put it mildly, lived a whirlwind life. Her rags to-riches story is mind-blowing: She was kidnapped as a child by her mother in the Dominican Republic and brought to the US. She was later kidnapped again by her grandmother and uncle, and moved from New York to Florida. As an adult, she ended a difficult marriage and endured homelessness with her children in Los Angeles. But through it all she never lost her sense of humor.  Born with a wonderful wit and an irrepressible spirit, Aida used her gifts and worked tirelessly, turning tragedy and pain into biting comedy that takes on everything from misogyny and racism to social media and news headlines. She eventually released a hit HBO Max special which led to multiple development deals\u2014success that won her a nationwide audience, opened doors, and helped her expand the way Latinos are represented in comedy.   In this, her highly anticipated first book, Aida charts her many ups and downs. From personal setbacks to career highs and everything in between, Legitimate Kid is endearing, shocking, and ultimately life-affirming. "

Dee became a physical education teacher, thinking he would have it made: coaching, summers off and a good pension. But he found himself dreaming of a career in comedy, until one day, years later, he turned in his teaching certificate and picked up a microphone. He went on to become one of Canada's top comics.   In his new book of essays, Dee writes about his life\u2014being a kid in suburban Toronto, becoming a father, starring in his own TV show, going on the road to comedy clubs across Canada and the US. He takes us behind the scenes of Last Comic Standing, Mr. D and everywhere in between. There was the time he set up his own DVD-signing appearances, only to have no one show up. Or the time he was flown to the Bahamas, where he performed for drunken fishermen and their \"nieces.\" And he shares his lifelong affliction with hypochondria and all the medical conditions he doesn't have. This is Gerry Dee at his comedic finest. "

                "\"Masterful. ... Friedman excels at bringing the dining room to boisterous life with vivid, telling details. ... This will sate gastronomes and casual foodies alike.\" \u2014 Publishers Weekly (starred review)    Acclaimed \"chef writer\" Andrew Friedman introduces readers to all the people and processes that come together in a single restaurant dish, creating an entertaining, vivid snapshot of the contemporary restaurant community, modern farming industry, and food-supply chain.    On a typical evening, in a contemporary American restaurant, a table orders their dinner from a server. It's an exchange that happens dozens, or hundreds, of times a night\u2014the core transaction that keeps the place churning. In this book, acclaimed chef writer Andrew Friedman slows down time to focus on a single dish at Chicago's Wherewithall restaurant, following its production and provenances via real-time kitchen and in-the-field reportage, from the moment the order is placed to when the finished dish is delivered to the table.  As various components of this one dish are prepared by the kitchen team, Friedman introduces readers to the players responsible for producing it, from the chefs who conceived the dish and manage the kitchen, to the line cooks and sous chefs who carry out the actual cooking, and the dishwashers who keep pace with the dining room.  Readers will also meet the producers, farmers, and ranchers, who supply the restaurant, as Friedman visits each stop in the supply chain and profiles the key characters whose expertise and effort play essential roles in making the dish possible\u2014they will walk rows of crops that line Midwestern farms, feel the chill of the cooler where beef dry-ages, harvest grapes at a Michigan winery, ride along with a delivery-truck driver, and hear the immigration sagas prevalent amongst often unseen and unheralded farm and restaurant workers.  The Dish is a rollicking ride inside every aspect of a restaurant dish. Both a fascinating window onto our food systems, and a celebration of the unsung heroes of restaurants and the collaborative nature of professional kitchen work, The Dish will ensure that readers never look at any restaurant meal the same way again.

Everything from ingrained family values to mind-altering algorithms create our foundations, warp how we see the world, manipulate our decisions, and dictate our beliefs. Yet rarely do we question these everyday influences of our modern times even as we go further down the path of  unwell, unhappy,  and  unhinged .\u00a0 A high-spirited exploration through the troublesome influences of our world,  Raising Hell, Living Well , Jessica Elefante\u2019s eye-opening debut, follows one bullshit artist\u2019s journey, from small-time salesperson to award-winning corporate strategist to founder of the digital wellbeing movement Folk Rebellion, in coming to terms with how she was wielding influence\u2014and the forces she was under herself.\u00a0\u00a0 With whip-smart writing and wry humor, Elefante\u2019s collection of essays is a head-trip through her misadventures. From explaining productivity as a symptom of the influence of capitalism to how the wellness industry makes us feel more unwell or our unquestioning participation in oversharing, optimization, and instant gratification, she invites us to reexamine our world, our pasts, and ourselves through the lens of influence. Now a  reformed  brand strategist, Elefante lays bare her own culpability, sharing what she learned\u2014and what she got wrong. She offers a new take on intentional living and provides a simple practice to deconstruct how the powers-that-be are attempting to modify our behaviors. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be questioning everything from how you take your coffee to how our social institutions are structured. And you\u2019ll learn how to live free from the influences around us\u2014including Elefante herself.\u00a0 The much-needed subversive voice to demystify these times, Elefante will make you angry, make you laugh, and make you think about how you\u2019re  really  living. Unpretentious, sharply observed, and devil-hearted,  Raising Hell, Living Well  holds out a hand to help you climb out from under the influence. "

                "\"Excellent....Taken as a whole, the volume moves beyond food's sensory pleasures to investigate it as a cultural vessel, a symbol of inequality, and more. It's a standout addition to the series.\"  \u2014Publisher's Weekly (starred review)    A collection of the year's top food writing, selected by prolific food writer and author of How to Cook Everything Mark Bittman.   \"In almost any culture, at any time, you can find food writing,\" writes guest editor Mark Bittman in his introduction. \"Food means growing and hardship, and health and medicine, and work and holiday. In its abundance it is a gift and a joy, and in its absence a curse and a tragedy. If a culture has writing, that culture has food writing.\" The stories in this year's Best American Food Writing are brilliant, eye-opening windows into the heart of our country's culture. From the link between salt and sex, to Syrian refugees transforming ancient Turkish food traditions, to the FDA's crusade on alternative non-dairy milk options, to Black farmers in Arkansas seeking justice, the scope of these essays spans nearly every aspect of our society. This anthology offers an entertaining and poignant look at how food shapes our lives and how food writing shapes our culture.    THE BEST AMERICAN FOOD WRITING 2023 INCLUDES JAYA SAXENA   LIGAYA MISHAN   MARION NESTLE TOM PHILPOTT   WESLEY BROWN   ALICIA KENNEDY CAROLINE HATCHETT   AMY LOEFFLER and others. "

                "'A delightful odyssey through the history, nostalgia, fascination and British love of cake. Quirky, charming, and fun.' PRUE LEITH The British take cakes seriously. We hold strong opinions about how to bake a brownie with the perfect squidge, the correct proportions of icing to sponge, and whether it's jam or cream first on our scones. Now \u2013 thanks to the success of a certain TV baking show \u2013 our flirtation with flour, fruit and frosting has become a full-blown love affair. But how did the humble cake evolve from a simple combination of starch and fat to the show-stopping bakes of today, taking pride of place at every meaningful life celebration? Travelling the country from Dundee to the Isle of Wight, writer Andrew Baker (by name, not occupation) serves up the story of our national obsession with cake, one slice at a time. On this greediest of quests, Andrew seeks to discover the 'True Slice' of each iconic cake. This enviable task sees him eat sponge sandwiched with jam and cream at Queen Victoria's holiday home Osborne House, discover the illustrious yet scandal-filled history of the Battenberg's saccharine squares and learn how a caterpillar enrobed in chocolate became a party-starting birthday centerpiece. From King Alfred's oatcakes to The River Caf\u00e9's revered Chocolate Nemesis, this is the crumb-spattered, buttercream-smeared story of the cakes that have claimed a place on British tables \u2013 and in our hearts.

UNRELIABLE NARRATOR is a collection of essays that uses Aparna\u2019s signature humor to illuminate an interior life, one constantly bossed around by her depression (whom she calls Brenda), laced with anxiety like a horror movie full of jump-scares, and plagued by an unrepenting love-hate relationship with her career as a painfully shy standup comedian. But luckily, crippling self-doubt comes with the gift of keen self-examination.\u00a0These essays deliver hilarious and incredibly insightful meditations on body image, productivity culture, the ultra-meme-ability of mental health language, and who, exactly, gets to make art \u201cabout nothing.\u201d Despite her own arguments to the contrary, UNRELIABLE NARRATOR is undeniable proof that Aparna is a force\u2014as a comedian and author alike\u2014to be reckoned with.

Who better to help us articulate this sense of direction than the most articulate people among us? Writers and thinkers, Ben Hutchinson suggests in this sparkling new book, help us reflect on purpose. Interweaving his own (mis-)adventures with those of major authors such as T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf and R.M. Rilke, Hutchinson proposes ten ways in which reading and writing encourage us to ask difficult questions, project our minds into the past and future, and see ourselves and others differently. Engaging and aphoristic, this book is for anyone who finds themselves wondering how to live more mindfully, more forcefully \u2013 more fully. "

Southern food is integral to the American culinary tradition, yet the question of who \"owns\" it is one of the most provocative touch points in our ongoing struggles over race. In this unique memoir, culinary historian Michael W. Twitty takes readers to the white-hot center of this fight, tracing the roots of his own family and the charged politics surrounding the origins of soul food, barbecue, and all Southern cuisine.  From the tobacco and rice farms of colonial times to plantation kitchens and backbreaking cotton fields, Twitty tells his family story through the foods that enabled his ancestors' survival across three centuries. He sifts through stories, recipes, genetic tests, and historical documents, and travels from Civil War battlefields in Virginia to synagogues in Alabama to Black-owned organic farms in Georgia.  As he takes us through his ancestral culinary history, Twitty suggests that healing may come from embracing the discomfort of the Southern past. Along the way, he reveals a truth that is more than skin deep\u2014the power that food has to bring the kin of the enslaved and their former slaveholders to the table, where they can discover the real America together.

                "Selected writings on three decades of popular music from one of the most influential critics of his generation.  Spanning three decades worth of astute, acerbic, and overall astounding music writing,  Kick Out the Jams  is the first large-scale anthology of the work of renowned critic Dave Marsh. Ranging from Elvis Presley to Kurt Cobain, from Nina Simone to Ani DiFranco, from the Beatles to Green Day, the book gives an opinionated, eye-opening overview of 20th century popular music\u2014offering a portrait not just of an era but of a writer wrestling with the American empire.   Every essay bears the distinct Dave Marsh attitude and voice. That passion is evident in a heart-wrenching piece on Cobain's suicide and legacy; a humorous attack on \"Bono's bullshit;\" an indignant look at James Brown and the FBI; deep, revelatory probes into the work of underappreciated artists like Patty Griffin and Alejandro Escovedo; and inspiring insight into what drives Marsh as a writer, namely \"a raging passion to explain things in the hope that others would not be trapped and to keep the way clear so that others from the trashy outskirts of barbarous America still had a place to stand\u2014if not in the culture at large, at least in rock and roll.\"   If you want to explore the recent history of pop music\u2014its politics as well as its performers\u2014 Kick Out the Jams  is the perfect guidebook.

What I've tried to do is organize some of the feelings and thoughts that events, so far, have provoked in me, in those scraps of time the year itself has allowed.

Lillian Stone\u2014childhood evangelical, AOL girlfriend, and professional nail biter is always living on the edge of anxiety. From the pitfalls of a girl plagued by religious trauma, the incomprehensible yet unforgiving need for perfection, and a poorly-behaved twenty-pound beagle, Everybody's Favorite is a refreshing story of what it means to pick yourself when the world is telling you otherwise. Still navigating the ins and outs of adulthood, accompanied by an obsessive-compulsive disorder that's become an exercise in self-acceptance and thus compassion, Lillian has become an expert in fighting the urge to be someone else's idea of perfect. In this laugh-out-loud essay collection, replete with cringe-inducing touchstones of an early-aughts girlhood, Lillian Stone recounts her quest to be everybody's favorite.  Set largely during the early 2000s Ozarks, and peppered with Stone's biting satire and gloriously self-deprecating personal anecdotes, Everybody's Favorite is a wry, empathetic look at the chaos that ensues when we contort ourselves into an ever-changing assortment of socially acceptable shapes \u2014only to fall out of place, twist an ankle, pee your pants a little, and realize that the pursuit of perfection isn't really all that interesting.

One of America's leading essayists, Sontag's writings are commentaries on the relation between moral and aesthetic ideas, discussing the works of Antonin Artaud, Leni Riefenstahl, Elias Canetti, Walter Benjamin, and others.   The collection includes a variety of her well-known essays. In \"Fascinating Fascism,\" Sontag eviscerates Leni Riefenstahl's attempts to rehabilitate her image after working for Adolf Hitler on propaganda films during World War II. \"Approaching Artaud\" reflects on the work and influence of french actor, director, and writer Antonin Artaud. The title essay is a study of the life and temperament of Walter Benjamin, who Sontag describes as a sad and lonesome man. The book also includes the essays \"On Paul Goodman,\" \"Syberberg's Hitler,\" \"Remembering Barthes,\" and \"Mind as Passion\".  Susan Sontag's writings are famously full of intellectual range and depth, and are at turns exhilarating, ominous, disturbing, and beautiful.  Under the Sign of Saturn  manages to touch on all of these notes and more. "

The Great Resignation. Sometimes a literary sensibility catches the spirit of the times. In  I'd Rather Not , Robert Skinner has it all covered. This wonderful audiobook of adventures (and misadventures) in theart of living is wryly subversive and constantly hilarious. It is about work, escape and that something more we all need. 'I was sleeping in what might reasonably be described as a ditch, though I tried not tothink of it in those terms for morale reasons ...' Robert Skinner arrives in the city, searching for a richer life. Things begin badly and then, surprisingly, get slightly worse. Pretty soon he's sleeping rough and trying to run a literary magazine out of a dog park. His quest for meaning keeps being thwarted, by gainful employment, beagles, house parties, ill-advised love affairs, camel trips and bureaucratic entanglements. I'd Rather Not is a deeply funny book of light and shade, triumph and misadventure,where the wisdom is hard-won and promptly forgotten. Yet even when his ventures fail, Robert Skinner succeeds, always, in delighting listeners. For fans of Sloane C rosley, Andrew Sean Greer, Nathan Fielder and David Sedaris. "

And Tom Papa, whose loyal audiences are packed with \"date night\" couples of all ages, has perfected the form. In  We're All In This Together , Papa's thirty-seven short essays tackle these universal American topics, among others: \u2013Love for Your First Car (\"To Buy or Lease\") \u2013The Truth about Personal Hygiene (\"How You Know When It's Time to Go\") \u2013Date Nights (\"Will You Go Out with Me?\") \u2013Unfamiliar Hotel Rooms (\"Why Nothing Works\") \u2013Pets (\"Cats\u2013Ancient Menace\") \u2013Drinking (\"There's no Cure for a Hangover\") \u2013Ducking your Family, even Though you Love Them (\"The Lesson of Mark Twain's Cigars\") Tom Papa's books make readers laugh, but\u2013crucially\u2013feel better about themselves while doing it. And while there's thematic overlap with Papa's stand-up, with a couple of exceptions, all the writing here is fresh for our book.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

This journal of the invasion, a collection of Andrey Kurkov's writings and broadcasts from Kyiv, is a remarkable record of a brilliant writer at the forefront of a twenty-first-century war. Andrey Kurkov has been a consistent satirical commentator on his adopted country of Ukraine. His most recent work, Grey Bees, is a dark foreshadowing of the devastation in the eastern part of Ukraine in which only two villagers remain in a village bombed to smithereens. The author has lived in Kyiv and in the remote countryside of Ukraine throughout the Russian invasion. He has also been able to fly to European capitals where he has been working to raise money for charities and to address crowded halls. Kurkov has been asked to write for every English newspaper, as also to be interviewed all over Europe. He has become an important voice for his people. Kurkov sees every video and every posted message, and he spends the sleepless nights of continuous bombardment of his city delivering the truth about this invasion to the world. "

Like the creators of these films and television series, the authors in this book harness the magical mix of humor, action, empathy, characterization, adventure, and fan service that constitutes Star Wars. In addition to thorny metaphysical questions about the nature of time and free will, this volume highlights the staggering cultural impact of George Lucas's universe. The newest Star Wars narratives tackle ethnicity on alien worlds and how love and sex with a droid like L3-37 would work (\"It works\"). The connections between the Separatist Freedom Movement and the struggle for social justice in the USA in the twenty-first century are brought to light. And philosophical second looks at Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi prove there is much more to this controversial entry in the Skywalker saga. Thirty-six philosophers, both sages and scoundrels among them, examine the full range of deep questions throughout the Star Wars chronology-from The Phantom Menace to The Rise of Skywalker and beyond. \"They have spoken.\" "

From racism, broken treaties, and cultural pillaging, to the value of Indigenous lives and the importance of Indigenous literature, this collection reveals facts about Indigenous life in Canada that are both devastating and enlightening. Truth Telling also demonstrates the myths underlying Canadian history and the human cost of colonialism, showing how it continues to underpin modern social institutions in Canada.  Passionate and uncompromising, Michelle Good affirms that meaningful and substantive reconciliation hinges on recognition of Indigenous self-determination, the return of lands, and a just redistribution of the wealth that has been taken from those lands without regard for Indigenous peoples.  Truth Telling is essential reading for those looking to acknowledge the past and understand the way forward. "

In each, Tabatabai beautifully evokes the emotional tension between life and death, wellness and disease, uncertainty and hope, in a unique and unforgettable way.  Exploring themes of illness, dying, grief, and joy, universal in its reach, These Vital Signs tells stories both remarkable and utterly ordinary of a doctor and the patients who have shaped him. "

                "Paris Review  contributor Katy Kelleher explores our obsession with gorgeous things, unveiling the fraught histories of makeup, flowers, perfume, silk, and other beautiful objects.      April recommended reading by the  New York Times Book Review ,  Vanity Fair ,  Goodreads ,  Jezebel ,  Christian Science Monitor ,  All Arts ,   and the  Next Big Idea Club     One of  Curbed 's and  Globe and Mail 's (Toronto) best books of the spring    A most anticipated book of 2023 by  The Millions   Katy Kelleher has spent much of her life chasing beauty. As a child, she uprooted handfuls of purple, fragrant little flowers from the earth, plucked iridescent seashells from the beach, and dug for turquoise stones in her backyard. As a teenager she applied glittery shimmer to her eyelids after religiously dabbing on her signature scent of orange blossoms and jasmine. And as an adult, she coveted gleaming marble countertops and delicate porcelain to beautify her home. This obsession with beauty led her to become a home, garden, and design writer, where she studied how beautiful things are mined, grown, made, and enhanced. In researching these objects, Kelleher concluded that most of us are blind to the true cost of our desires. Because whenever you find something unbearably beautiful, look closer, and you'll inevitably find a shadow of decay lurking underneath.    In these dazzling and deeply researched essays, Katy Kelleher blends science, history, and memoir to uncover the dark underbellies of our favorite goods. She reveals the crushed beetle shells in our lipstick, the musk of rodents in our perfume, and the burnt cow bones baked into our dishware. She untangles the secret history of silk and muses on her problematic prom dress. She tells the story of countless workers dying in their efforts to bring us shiny rocks from unsafe mines that shatter and wound the earth, all because a diamond company created a compelling ad. She examines the enduring appeal of the beautiful dead girl and the sad fate of the ugly mollusk. With prose as stunning as the objects she describes, Kelleher invites readers to examine their own relationships with the beautiful objects that adorn their body and grace their homes.    And yet, Kelleher argues that while we have a moral imperative to understand our relationship to desire, we are not evil or weak for desiring beauty.  The Ugly History of Beautiful Things  opens our eyes to beauty that surrounds us, helps us understand how that beauty came to be, what price was paid and by whom, and how we can most ethically partake in the beauty of the world.

Paul must contend with both the devious rival House Harkonnen and the gargantuan desert sandworms-the source of the spice. The future of the Imperium depends upon one young man who will need to lead a new jihad to control the universe. Dune and Philosophy recruits twenty-three philosophers to sift wisdom from Frank Herbert's Duniverse, including the first of an expected series of films following Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides and his descendants, captivatingly brought to the big screen in 2021. Substantial yet accessible chapters address philosophical questions including: - Is it morally right to create a savior? - Would interplanetary travel change human nature? - In conflict, how can you stay light years ahead of your opponents? - Does history repeat itself?.

                "Brought to you by Penguin.  Say 'philosopher,' and someone grand, old and bearded might come to mind. But, as philosophy professor Scott Hershovitz shows in this delightful debut, some of the best philosophers in the world are better described as nasty, brutish and short\u2014that is to say, they're children. Children make wonderful philosophers because they constantly question things that grown-ups take for granted, test theories about the people around them, and try to work out the way the world works. Following the lead of his two young sons, Rex and Hank, Hershovitz takes us on a unique tour through classical and contemporary philosophy, steered by questions like, does Hank have the right to drink Fanta? When is it okay to swear? And, does the number six exist? Fast-paced and funny,  Nasty, Brutish, and Short  is a unique guide to the art of thinking. Alongside Rex and Hank, Hershovitz investigates big questions about rights, revenge, punishment and authority; sex, gender and race; the nature of truth and knowledge, the size of the universe, and the existence of god. The result is an irresistible invitation to become more discerning thinkers, by cultivating our innate, childlike wonder at the world. \u00a9 Scott Hershovitz 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022. "

                "From #1 international bestselling author, speaker, and humanitarian Dave Pelzer comes the next chapter in his life\u2014how, after spending decades saving others in the military, as a fire captain, and an internationally acclaimed advocate, he needs to confront a way to save himself. On the surface, Dave Pelzer's life seems like an action movie\u2014he's walked the red carpet with celebrities and stood shoulder to shoulder with soldiers in Iraq; he's flown top-secret missions for the U.S. Air Force, obtaining the rank of chief, and battled wildfires in California as a volunteer fire captain. And now\u2014on the eve of the 50-year anniversary of this rescue from horrific childhood of abuse and into the safety of the foster care system\u2014he reflects on the battles he's fighting in his own heart. From a lifetime spent serving and saving others, can he learn how to serve and save himself? Banished to his basement at age five, Dave Pelzer had cried a river of tears before most children learned to tie their shoes. His now classic books, A Child Called \"It\"and The Lost Boy, chronicled how he was brutally beaten and starved by his emotionally unstable, alcoholic mother: a mother who nearly killed him multiple times. But despite the odds stacked against him, he rose to become a #1 New York Times bestselling author, inspirational speaker, and internationally recognized humanitarian. After fighting for years to vanquish his pain and to channel it into service forothers, Pelzer sifts through the psychological rubble of a life that has seemingly crumbled around him. What he shares is deeply transformative and unflinchingly honest. In his struggle to simply survive, he never learned how to just be. Reeling from the loss of a love\u2014and a broken spirit\u2014Pelzer must reconcile his life choices and free himself of blame and shame to find peace and renewed purpose. Amidst the towering redwood trees and the serenity of his childhood utopia of the Russian River, Pelzer reflects on having the courage to move forward in your life, the peace to accept yourself, the vulnerability to strip yourself of facades, and to find the tenacity to carry on when life doesn't turn out the way you planned. For anyone who has been hurt, victimized, or feels alone, there is hope and there is always a way to rewrite your own story. Pelzer's soulful and inspiring story will remind you to keep your faith, live with gratitude, and find the well of resilience deep within you. "

It is a body that others map their expectations on, but it has never let me down.  In this insightful, funny, and whip-smart book, acclaimed writer Evette Dionne explores the minefields fat Black woman are forced to navigate in the course of everyday life. From her early experiences of harassment to adolescent self-discovery in internet chatrooms to diagnosis with heart failure at age twenty-nine, Dionne tracks her relationships with friendship, sex, motherhood, agoraphobia, health, pop culture, and self-image.  Along the way, she lifts back the curtain to reveal the subtle, insidious forms of surveillance and control levied at fat women: At the doctor's office, where any health ailment is treated with a directive to lose weight. On dating sites, where larger bodies are rejected or fetishized. On TV, where fat characters are asexual comedic relief. But Dionne's unflinching account of our deeply held prejudices is matched by her fierce belief in the power of self-love.  An unmissable portrait of a woman on a journey toward understanding our society and herself, Weightless holds up a mirror to the world we live in and asks us to imagine the future we deserve. "

Spanning from the nineties through to today,  Nerd  is a collection of cultural criticism essays through the lens of fandom for everyone from the casual Marvel movie watcher to the hardcore Star Wars expanded universe connoisseur. \"In the same way that the fandoms Phillips addresses often provide community and a sense of connection, the experience of reading  Nerd  feels like making a new friend\" (Karen Han, cultural critic and screenwriter).

My People is the definitive collection of her reportage and commentary. Spanning datelines in the American South, South Africa and points scattered in between, her work constitutes a history of our time as rendered by the pen of a singular and indispensable black woman journalist.\"-Jelani Cobb    From the legendary Emmy Award-winning journalist, a collection of ground-breaking reportage from across five decades which vividly chronicles the experience of Black life in America today.   At just eighteen years old,Charlayne Hunter-Gault made national news when she mounted a successful legal challenge that culminated in her admission to the University of Georgia in January 1961\u2014making her one of the first two Black students to integrate the institution. As an adult, Charlayne switched from being the subject of news to covering it, becoming one of its most recognized and acclaimed interpreters.  Over more than five decades, this dedicated reporter charted a course through some of the world's most respected journalistic institutions, including The New Yorker and the New York Times, where she was often the only Black woman in the newsroom. Throughout her storied career, Charlayne has chronicled the lives of Black people in America\u2014shining a light on their experiences and giving a glimpse into their community as never before. Though she has covered numerous topics and events, observed as a whole, her work reveals the evolving issues at the forefront of Black Americans lives and how many of the same issues continue to persist today.  My People showcases Charlayne's lifelong commitment to reporting on Black people in their totality, \"in ways that are recognizable to themselves.\" Spanning from the Civil Rights Movement through the election and inauguration of America's first Black president and beyond, this invaluable collection shows the breadth and nuance of the Black experience through trials, tragedies, and triumphs of everyday lives.

Buy this book\u2014you\u2019ll be glad you did.\u201d\u2014Larry the Cable Guy      John Crist wasn\u2019t always recognizable as \u201cthe guy from that hilarious video in the grocery store.\u201d Growing up part of a homeschool family of ten in rural Georgia with Mennonite grandparents and a high-school job at Chick-fil-A, he was an unlikely candidate for internet fame. Despite all that, or perhaps because of it, Crist passionately pursued his dream of stand-up comedy. \u00a0 In his first book, Crist offers heartfelt, laugh-out-loud observations on the absurd ways we all try to make ourselves look better online: like how we all post filtered pictures of our super healthy kale salads but somehow neglect to post about our 1 A.M. Uber Eats Big Mac. Or how quick we all are to post our \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker pictures but fail to post about the ways we vote with our dollars every day in ways that don\u2019t align with our loudly and publicly espoused values. \u00a0 With self-deprecating wit, Crist chronicles his meteoric rise as an online and stand-up comedian, but he doesn\u2019t gloss over the ways his own life choices did not align with his online image\u2014a gap between perception and reality that eventually led to a stint in rehab. \u00a0 In  Delete That,  Crist takes responsibility for his actions, offers some reflections on how to do better, and encourages us all to stop capitulating to the fear of \u201cBut what will they think?!\u201d Instead, this book offers a bold invitation to stop curating life and start living it . . . one Nickelback concert at a time.

One of the nation's most popular presenters, Sir David examines 40 marvels of the natural world from his extraordinary and pioneering experiences. What was Sir David's first pet? Which animal would he most like to be? How did he track down a giant earthworm? Why does he respect rats? And what did he do when confronted by a ten-foot-long reptile? His enthusiasm is as infectious as ever, and conveys a unique fascination on topics as diverse as the sloth, monstrous flowers, the platypus, dragons, the fire salamander, the coelacanth, the dodo, bird's-nest soup and the large blue butterfly. So listen to these stories to find out the real reason why animals sing, the story behind a 150-million-year-old feather, and what it is about snakes that really unnerves Sir David. \u00a92021 BBC Studios Distribution Ltd (P)2021 BBC Studios Distribution Ltd.

Did you know that your morning coffee could be thanks to a herd of energetic goats? Or that a forgotten ingredient is behind the invention of the beloved brownie? Who got the fright of their life discovering corn could pop? And which popular soft drink first started out as a medicinal syrup?  In Serendipity, Oscar Farinetti, founder of the high-end global food chain Eataly, shares fifty remarkable stories of how some of the greatest successes and examples of excellence in the food world came about by chance, from the invention of foods such as tarte tatin to the sandwich, as well as products like Nutella and corn flakes, plus some of the world's best wines, Gorgonzola cheese, balsamic vinegar, French fries, rum, and even the ice-cream cone. As Farinetti dives deep into these extraordinary histories, insightful and entertaining interviews with leading artisan food producers, chefs, inventors, and CEOs around the world provide additional color and rare context.   The result is a remarkable listen that explores humankind's never-ending quest to discover something new and reminds us that our mistakes, our flaws, and our failures can often be the most necessary ingredient in finding success.

After hearing a harrowing coming-of-age story from her great aunt, Rachel Kauder Nalebuff started gathering stories about menstruation in her family that had never been told. What began as an oral history project quickly snowballed: Rachel heard from family and friends, and then from strangers\u2014writers, experts, community leaders, activists, young people, and other visionaries\u2014about the most intimate physical transformations in their lives.    Our Red Book  takes us through stories of first periods, last periods, missing periods, and everything about bleeding that people wish they had been told. Weaving together powerful voices\u2014from teenagers, midwives, Indigenous scholars, Olympic athletes, incarcerated writers, disoriented fathers, elected leaders who fought to make period products free, friends transitioning genders, grandmothers, and lovers\u2014the book invites us on a collective journey of growth and change, with Rachel's own voice as a guide.   The result is a people's history of menstruation, told through an array of perspectives and identities that span the globe. Gathered over twenty years, the collection takes stock of our shifting relationships to family, cultural inheritance, gender, aging, and liberation. "

Dickinson writes the unimaginable and terrifying facts of heart-breaking loss. In The Loneliest Places she tells stories from her months on the run, fleeing her grief and herself, as she escapes to Iceland and the Falkland Islands\u2015as far as possible from the memories of her dead son, Jack. She frankly relates the paralyzing emotion that sometimes left her trapped in her home, confined to a single chair, helplessly isolated. The tales from these years are bleak and Dickinson's journey home, back to her changed self and fractured family, is lonely. Conjuring Emily Dickinson, she describes, though, how hope was sighted, allowed to perch, and then, remarkably, made actual. "

Nora McInerny does  not  dance like no one is watching. In fact, she dances like everyone is watching, which is to say, she does not dance at all. A bestselling author and host of the beloved podcast  Terrible, Thanks for Asking , she has captured the hearts of millions with her disarming and earnest approach to discussing grief and loss. Now, with  Bad Vibes Only , she turns her eye on our aggressively, oppressively optimistic culture, our obsession with self-improvement, and what it really means to live authentically in the online age.   In essays that revisit her cringey past and anticipate her rapidly approaching, early middle-aged future, McInerny lays bare her own chaos, inviting us to drop the fa\u00e7ade of perfection and embrace the truth: that we are all\u2014at best\u2014slightly unhinged. Socrates claimed that the unexamined life is not worth living.  Bad Vibes Only  is for people who have taken that dictum a bit too far\u2014the overthinkers, the analyzers, the recovering Girl Bosses, and the burned-out personal brand\u2014reminding us that a life worth living is about more than just \"good vibes.\" "

Robinson shares surprising stories of illness and medicine that do not sacrifice hard truth for easy dramatics. These true stories are filled with details of difficult days and nights in the world of high-tech medical care, and they show the ongoing struggle in making critical decisions with no good answer. This collection presents the raw moments where his expertise in medical ethics and pediatrics are put to the test. He is neither saint, nor hero, nor wizard. Robinson admits that on his best days he was merely ordinary. Yet in writing down the authentic stories of his patients, Robinson discovers what led him to the practice of medicine-and how his idealism was no match for the realities he faced in modern health care.

Chicken may not be an extravagant ingredient, but for master chef Jacques P\u00e9pin, it is the one he turns to most frequently\u2014to cook and to paint. In this beautifully illustrated book, Jacques reminisces on his life through the lens of the humble bird, from his childhood in rural France, where he chased chickens and watched as his maman turned them into her poulet \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me, to his demanding apprenticeship and long, illustrious career\u2014cooking Chicken Chasseur for Charles de Gaulle and his family, turning down a chance to work as JFK's White House Chef for a job at Howard Johnson's, and appearing on television alongside food-world luminaries like Julia Child. Throughout are Jacques' favorite chicken and egg recipes, conveyed as if he were sharing them over a dinner table. Most significantly, the book displays dozens of Jacques' stunning paintings of chickens. \"If it clucks or scratches, it's likely that Jacques has painted it.\" This unique book is the next best thing to a visit to Jacques' home, which would include a tour of his art studio, captivating conversation as he cooks, and a toast with a glass of wine over a simple meal of perfect roast chicken.

The 2014 \"Revolution of Dignity\" heralded a tremendous transformation of Ukrainian politics and society that has continued to ripple and reverberate throughout the world. In late 2015, a year and a half after the 2014 Revolution swept away the presidency of the Moscow-leaning kleptocratic President Viktor Yanukovich, Davidzon and his wife founded a literary journal, The Odessa Review, focusing on newly emergent trends in film, literature, painting, design, and fashion. The journal became an East European cultural institution, publishing outstanding writers in the region and beyond. From his vantage point as a journalist and editor, Davidzon came to observe events and know many of the leading figures in Ukrainian politics and culture, and to write about them for a Western audience. Davidzon later found himself in the center of world events as he became a United States government witness in the Ukraine scandal that shook the presidency of Donald Trump. This eagerly anticipated debut tells the real story of what happened in Ukraine from the keen and resilient perspective of an observer at its center. "

In  Koshersoul, Michael W. Twitty considers the marriage of two of the most distinctive culinary cultures in the world today: the foods and traditions of the African Atlantic and the global Jewish diaspora. To Twitty, the creation of African-Jewish cooking is a conversation of migrations and a dialogue of diasporas offering a rich background for inventive recipes and the people who create them.   The question that most intrigues him is not just who makes the food, but how the food makes the people. Jews of Color are not outliers, Twitty contends, but significant and meaningful cultural creators in both Black and Jewish civilizations. Koshersoul also explores how food has shaped the journeys of numerous cooks, including Twitty's own passage to and within Judaism.  As intimate, thought-provoking, and profound as The Cooking Gene, this remarkable book teases the senses as it offers sustenance for the soul.  Koshersoul includes recipes.

                "As Noam Chomsky writes about something\u2014US foreign policy, corporate policies, an election, or a movement\u2014he is not only quite specific in recounting the topic and its facts but also exercises blisteringly relentless logic to discern the interconnections between the evidence and broader themes involved.  This may seem mundane, but virtually every time, even aside from the details of the case in question, the process, the steps, the ways of linking one thing to another illustrate what it means to be a thinking, critical subject of history and society, in any time and place.  Taming the Rascal Multitude is a judicious selection of essays and interviews from Z Magazine from 1997 to 2014. In each, Chomsky takes up some question of the moment. As such, in sum, the essays provide a historical overview of the history that preceded Trump and the reaction to Trump. The essays situate what followed even without having known what would follow. They explicate what preceded the current era and provide a step-by-step revelation. or how-to, for successfully comprehending social events and relations. They are a pleasure to listen to, much like the pleasure of watching a great athlete or performer, but they also edify. They educate. "

In this thought-provoking collection of new essays, Mercado examines what it means to be \"polite,\" \"agreeable,\" and \"nice.\" She covers topics from the subtleties of the \"Bad Bitch\" and why women dominate the ASMR market, to what makes her dog an adorable little freak and how you know if you're shy. This is a book about the unspoken trick mirror of our \"good\" intentions: the inherent performance of the social media apology, celebrating men when they do the bare minimum, and why we trust a Midwesterner to watch our stuff when we go pee.  Throughout, she ponders her identity as an Asian woman and asks what \"nice\" even means\u2014and why anyone would want to be it. With writing that is as precise as it is profound, and cultural references that range from trash reality television to the New York Times Sunday-morning crossword puzzle, Mercado uncovers weird, long-overdue truths about our frailties and failings. In the end, she sees them not as a source of shame but as a cause for celebration. Filled with revelations that range from the silly to the serious,  She's Nice Though offers a mind-bending glimpse into the illusions and delusions of contemporary life\u2014and reveals who we *really* are when no one is watching.

Alcohol and Medicine have an inextricably intertwined history, with innovations in each altering the path of the other. The story stretches back to ancient times, when beer and wine were used to provide nutrition and hydration, and were employed as solvents for healing botanicals. Over time, alchemists distilled elixirs designed to cure all diseases, monastic apothecaries developed mystical botanical liqueurs, traveling physicians concocted dubious intoxicating nostrums, and the drinks we\u2019re familiar with today began to take form. In turn, scientists studied fermentation and formed the germ theory of disease, and developed an understanding of elemental gases and anesthetics. Modern cocktails like the Old-Fashioned, Gimlet, and Gin and Tonic were born as delicious remedies for diseases and discomforts. In Doctors and Distillers, cocktails and spirits expert Camper English reveals how and why the contents of our medicine and liquor cabinets were, until surprisingly recently, one and the same. "

Invisible in the food we eat, the people we kiss, and inside our own bodies, viruses flourish\u2014with the power to shape not only our health, but our social, political, and economic systems. Drawing on his expertise in microbiology, Joseph Osmundson brings readers under the microscope to understand the structure and mechanics of viruses and to examine how viruses like HIV and COVID-19 have redefined daily life.  Osmundson\u2019s buoyant prose builds on the work of the activists and thinkers at the forefront of the HIV/AIDS crisis and critical scholars like Jos\u00e9 Esteban Munoz to navigate the intricacies of risk reduction, draw parallels between queer theory and hard science, and define what it really means to \u201cgo viral.\u201d This dazzling multidisciplinary collection offers novel insights on illness, sex, and collective responsibility.  Virology  is a critical warning, a necessary reflection, and a call for a better future.  Special thanks to Ngofeen Mputubwele, Steven D. Booth, and David Barr, whose voices were featured on the audiobook. "

You ask yourself what the story is that you want to tell, and let the rest unfold: Click.\"\u2014from the introduction  Joe Greer never imagined he would become a photographer.   Raised in Florida by an aunt and uncle after his mother's death when he was four, Joe had a seemingly normal childhood, spending summers at church camp and dreaming of going to college. But nearly fifteen years later, the ground shifted beneath his feet when he discovered a family secret that would impact the rest of his life.  Trying to make sense of that revelation and what it meant for his future, Greer set his sights on becoming a pastor at Spokane's Moody Bible Institute. There, he discovered Instagram\u2014and a passion for photography. His pictures of the lush, wild beauty of the Pacific Northwest landscape attracted a large following that has grown to more than three quarters of a millions fans and continues to expand.   The Lay of the Land is Joe's story. In this stunning compendium, he reflects on the trauma of his early life and what photography has taught him: how to find his light; how to slow down; how to appreciate the world around him, a reverence for the nature world that that both nurtures and amplifies his creativity and faith; how to love\u2014his photography led him to his wife, Madison\u2014and how to heal. For Joe, photography has been a way to find purpose, better understand his faith, and express himself. Though he began with landscapes, meeting his wife sparked a new love of portraiture, and he turned to making photos of street scenes that explored his complicated feelings about family.   A love letter to the natural world, to faith, and to finding your calling in the most unexpected places, The Lay of the Land is a window into the beautiful mind and heart of one of the internet's favorite photographers. Moving and inspiring, it is a creative and spiritual journey that offers lessons on life and living. As Greer reminds us all, whatever it is you want, it's up to you to make the moment (and the photograph). "

There are 23 million people, representing more than twenty countries, each with unique languages, histories, and cultures, clumped under one banner: Asian American. Though their experiences are individual, certain commonalities appear.   -The pressure to perform and the weight of the model minority myth.  -The proximity to whiteness (for many) and the resulting privileges.  -The desexualizing, exoticizing, and fetishizing of their bodies.  -The microaggressions.  -The erasure and overt racism.   Through a series of essays and poems, thirty creators give voice to moments that defined them and shed light on the immense diversity and complexity of the Asian American identity. Edited by CAPE and with an introduction by renowned journalist SuChin Pak,  My Life: Growing Up Asian in America  is a celebration of community, a call to action, and a road map for a brighter future.   Featuring contributions from bestselling authors Melissa de la Cruz, Marie Lu, and Tana\u00efs; journalists Amna Nawaz, Edmund Lee, and Aisha Sultan; TV and film writers Teresa Hsiao, Heather Jeng Bladt, and Nathan Ramos-Park; and industry leaders Ellen K.

                "A fearless and darkly comic essay collection about race, justice and the limits of good intentions from the editor in chief of  Catapult.     In this stunning debut collection, award-winning voice actor and cultural critic Tajja Isen explores the absurdity of living in a world that has grown fluent in the language of social justice but doesn\u2019t always follow through. \u00a0 These nine daring essays explore the sometimes troubling and often awkward nature of that discord.  Some of My Best Friends  takes on subjects including the cartoon industry\u2019s pivot away from color-blindcasting, the pursuit of diverse representation in the literary world, the law\u2019s refusal to see inequality, and the cozy fictions of nationalism. Throughout, Isen deftly examines the quick, cosmetic fixes society makes to address systemic problems and reveals the unexpected ways they can misfire. \u00a0 In the spirit of Zadie Smith, Cathy Park Hong and Jia Tolentino, Isen interlaces cultural criticism with her lived experience to explore the gaps between what we say and what we do, what we do and what we value, and what we value and what we demand.

                "From the host of NPR affiliate's Forum with Michael Krasny, a compendium of Jewish jokes that packs the punches with hilarious riff after riff and also offers a window into Jewish culture.  Michael Krasny has been telling Jewish jokes since his bar mitzvah, and it's been said that he knows more of them than anyone on the planet. He certainly states his case in this wise, enlightening, and hilarious book that not only collects the best of Jewish humor passed down from generation to generation, but explains the cultural expressions and anxieties behind the laughs.  \"What's Jewish Alzheimer's?\" \"You forget everything but the grudges.\"  \"You must be so proud. Your daughter is the President of the United States!\" \"Yes. But her brother is a doctor!\"  \"Isn't Jewish humor masochistic?\" \"No. And if I hear that one more time I am going to kill myself.\"  With his background as a scholar and public-radio host, Krasny delves deeply into the themes, topics, and form of Jewish humor: chauvinism undercut by irony and self-mockery, the fear of losing cultural identity through assimilation, the importance of vocal inflection in joke-telling, and calls to communal memory, including the use of Yiddish.  Borrowing from traditional humor and such Jewish comedy legends as Jackie Mason, Mel Brooks, and Joan Rivers, Larry David, Sarah Silverman, Jerry Seinfeld and Amy Schumer, Let There Be Laughter is an absolute pleasure for the chosen and goyim alike.

                "Anjelah Johnson-Reyes   had two dreams as a kid: to be an actress and to be a chola.  You may know Anjelah Johnson for her viral sketch \"Nail Salon\" (over 100 million views globally) or her beloved ghetto-fabulous MadTV character Bon Qui Qui, but it's her clean humor and hilarious storytelling that make her one of the most successful stand-up comedians and actresses today. With her razor-sharp wit, Anjelah recounts funny stories from her journey\u2014from growing up caught between two worlds (do chips and salsa go with potato salad?) to unexpectedly embracing faith (\"I love Jesus, but I will punch a 'ho\") to her many adventures in dating (she may or may not have accepted dates simply for the food). Through it all, Anjelah transforms from a suburban-adjacent kid with Aquanet-drenched hair into a devoted Christian who abstains from drinking and premarital sex, into a mall-famous Oakland Raiders cheerleader, and then an  actually  famous comedian traveling the world and meeting people from all-walks of life, including Oprah. No biggie. (Huge biggie.) As she travels the world, Anjelah has eye-opening experiences, and she morphs from square, rigid Anjelah into \"Funjelah,\" and learns that she can still ride with Jesus without squashing the other parts of her personality.Anjelah's stories explore subjects such as navigating your racial identity, finding your place in the world, chasing your crazy dreams, the messiness of an evolving faith, and searching for belonging and meaning. Through her journey, Anjelah gets closer to discovering her true identity and encourages readers to have the audacity to dream big. "

Why does fashion hold so much power over us? Most of us care about how we dress and how we present ourselves. Style offers clues about everything from class to which in-group we belong to. Bad Feminist for fashion, Dress Code takes aim at the institutions within the fashion industry while reminding us of the importance of dress and what it means for self-presentation. Everything\u2014from societal changes to the progress (or lack thereof) of women's rights to the hidden motivations behind what we choose to wear to align ourselves with a particular social group\u2014can be tracked through clothing.   Veronique Hyland examines thought-provoking questions such as: Why has the \"French girl\" persisted as our most undying archetype? What does \"dressing for yourself\" really mean for a woman? How should a female politician dress? Will gender-differentiated fashion go forever out of style? How has social media affected and warped our sense of self-presentation, and how are we styling ourselves expressly for it?  Not everyone participates in painting, literature, or film. But there is no \"opting out\" of fashion. And yet, fashion is still seen as superficial and trivial, and only the finest of couture is considered as art. Hyland argues that fashion is a key that unlocks questions of power, sexuality, and class, taps into history, and sends signals to the world around us. Clothes means something\u2014even if you're \"just\" wearing jeans and a T-shirt.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

He somehow made his way to a job as a writer at  Saturday Night Live . While surviving that legendary gauntlet by the skin of his gnashing teeth, he stashed away the secrets of comedy writing\u2014eventually employing them in the immortal \u201cMotivational Speaker\u201d sketch for Chris Farley, honing them on  The Ben Stiller Show , and perfecting them on  Mr. Show with Bob and David .  In Hollywood, Bob demonstrated a bullheadedness that would shame Sisyphus himself, and when all hope was lost for the umpteenth time, the phone rang with an offer to appear on  Breaking Bad \u2014a show about how boring it is to be a high school chemistry teacher. His embrace of this strange new world of dramatic acting led him to working with Steven Spielberg, Alexander Payne, and Greta Gerwig, and then, in a twist that will confound you, he re-re-invented himself as a bona fide action star. Why? Read this and do your own psychoanalysis\u2014it\u2019s fun!  Featuring humorous tangents, wild characters, and Bob\u2019s trademark unflinching drive,  Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama  is a classic showbiz tale told by a determined idiot. "

It's a beautiful moment ) to being offered free gifts after an award ceremony ( It was an excruciating experience. Mortifying ) worry has accompanied her at every turn. This memoir is a joyful reflection on just how to live - and sometimes even thrive (sometimes not) - with anxiety. "

                "The first book of its kind, a collection bringing together leading Black scholars and experts for a policy-oriented approach to the fight for racial justice in America.  From ongoing reports of police brutality to the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on Black Americans, the year 2020 brought a renewed awareness to the deep-rootedness of racism and white supremacy in every facet of American life. As people have looked both inward and to their communities to understand the impact of systemic oppression, they have turned in droves to books for guidance in working toward a more just and equitable world. Until now, however, there has yet to be a book published for a general audience from the perspective of Black scholars and experts proposing ideas from a policy-oriented standpoint.  The Black Agenda: Bold Solutions for a Broken System  features Black voices across economics, education, health, climate, and technology, speaking to the question \"What's next?\" as it pertains to centering Black people in policy matters in our country. Essayists including Dr. Sandy Darity, Dr. Hedwig Lee, Mary Heglar, and Janelle Jones present groundbreaking ideas ranging from Black maternal and infant health to reparations to AI bias to inclusive economic policy, with the potential to uplift and heal not only Black America, but the entire country.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

                "Deeply funny, moving, and urgent writing about a country that can feel broken into pieces and the light that shines through the cracks, from Irish comedian Maeve Higgins, author of  Maeve in America .  \u00a0 As an eternally curious outsider, Maeve Higgins can see that the United States is still an experiment. Some parts work well and others  really  don\u2019t, but that doesn't stop her from loving the place and the people that make it. With piercing political commentary in a sweet and salty tone, these essays unearth answers to the questions we all have about this country we call home; the beauty of it all and the dark parts too. \u00a0 Maeve attends the 2020 Border Security Expo to better understand the future of our borders, and finds herself at The Alamo surrounded by queso and homemade rifles. A chance encounter with a statue of a teenage horseback rider causes her to interrogate the purpose of monuments, this sends her hurtling through the past, connecting Ireland\u2019s revolutionary history with the struggles of Black Americans today. And after mistaking edibles for innocent candies, Maeve gets way too high at Paper Source. \u00a0 Most of all, Maeve wants to leave this country and this planet better than she found it. That may well be impossible, but it certainly means showing love. Lots of it, even when it's difficult to do so. Threaded through these pieces is love for strangers, love for friends who show up right on time, love for trees, love for Tom Hardy, love for those with differing opinions, love for the glamorous older women of Brighton Beach with tattooed eyeliner and gold jewelry, love for everybody on this train.

Through architecture, ceramics, theatre, food, women and even toilets, Tanizaki explains the essence of shadows and darkness, and how they are able to augment beauty. He laments the heavy electric lighting of the West and its introduction to Japan, and shows how the artificial, bright and polished aesthetic of the West contrasts unfavorably with the moody and natural light of the East. Dreamy, melancholic and mysterious,  In Praise of Shadows  is a haunting insight into a forgotten world. "

This should become the gift all girlfriends give one another.\u201d\u2014Zibby Owens, host of the award-winning podcast  Moms Don\u2019t Have Time to Read Books     Jen Mann had what appeared to be the perfect life: a successful career as a bestselling author and award-winning blogger, a devoted husband, teenage kids who weren\u2019t total jerks, and a badass minivan. So imagine her surprise when, at forty-seven years old, a midlife crisis kicked her straight in the ladybits.    Midlife Bites  offers Jen\u2019s trademark wit and honesty when it comes to important conversations and observations about women in midlife. Here, readers will be able to come together and find anecdotes and practical ideas to help navigate through this major point in their lives. For women who may feel isolated or overlooked, this collection of original essays offers valuable insights, takeaways, and, most important, a productive way forward. Jen shares her own story as well as advice and wisdom from the online community she built, tackling everything that bites about midlife, where nothing is off-limits: raging hormones; sex (after forty); finding your purpose; learning to make new friends (yes, even as a grown-up); moving out of your comfort zone; having conversations that count, no more small talk; and how to deal with rogue chin hairs (and other nuisances).   Jen Mann is leading the movement to create a new space where middle-aged women can share openly and honestly with one another. This no-BS collection of essays will help start the conversation and keep it going, because as women, we all have a right to be happy, fulfilled, and whole, no matter what stage of life. "
