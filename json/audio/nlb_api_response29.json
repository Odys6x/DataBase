                "Much more than a response to harm, restorative justice nurtures relational, interconnected school cultures. The wisdom embedded within its principles and practices is being welcomed at a time when exclusionary discipline and zero-tolerance policies are recognized as perpetuating student apathy, disproportionality, and the school-to-prison pipeline.  Relying on the wisdom of early proponents of restorative justice, the daily experiences of educators, and the authors' extensive experience as classroom teachers and researchers, this  Little Book  guides the growth of restorative justice in education (RJE) into the future. Incorporating activities, stories, and examples throughout the book, three major interconnected and equally important aspects of restorative justice in education are explained and applied: Creating just and equitable learning environments;  Building and maintaining healthy relationships;    healing harm and transforming conflict   The Little Book of Restorative Justice in Education  is a reference that practitioners can turn to repeatedly for clarity and consistency as they implement restorative justice in educational settings. This audiobook includes a bonus lecture on restorative justice by series editor Howard Zehr and is deftly narrated by Mike Fraser  Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont. \u00a92016 Katherine Evans and Dorothy Vaandering (P) "

                "Challenging behavior is one of the most significant issues educators face.  Though it may seem radical to use words like  love, compassion,  and  heart  when we talk about behavior and discipline, the compassionate and heartfelt words, actions, and strategies teachers employ in the classroom directly shape who students are\u2014and who they will become. But how can teaching from the heart translate into effective supports and practices for students who exhibit challenging behavior?   In  From Behaving to Belonging: : The Inclusive Art of Supporting Students Who Challenge Us,  Julie Causton and Kate MacLeod detail how teachers can shift from a behavior management mindset (that punishes students for bad behavior or rewards students for good or compliant behavior) to an approach that supports all students\u2014even the most challenging ones\u2014with kindness, creativity, acceptance, and love.   Causton and MacLeod's approach   Focuses on students' strengths, gifts, and talents.   Ignites students' creativity and sense of self-worth.   Ensures that students' social, emotional, and academic needs are met.   Prompts teachers to rethink challenging behavior and how they support their students.   Helps teachers identify barriers to student success in the cultural, social, and environmental landscape.   Inspires teachers to reconnect with their core values and beliefs about students and teaching.   We need to transform our classrooms into places of love. To that end, this book represents a paradigm shift from a punitive mindset to a strengths-based, loving approach and encourages the radical act of creating more inclusive and caring schools.

                "Case Studies on Diversity and Social Justice Education  offers pre- and in-service educators an opportunity to analyze and reflect upon a variety of realistic case studies related to educational equity and social justice. The accessibly written cases allow educators to practice the process of considering a range of contextual factors, checking their own biases, and making immediate- and longer-term decisions about how to create and sustain equitable learning environments for all students. This revised edition adds ten new cases to offer greater coverage of elementary education, as well as topics such as body-shaming, Black Lives Matter, and transgender oppression. Existing cases have been updated to reflect new societal contexts, and streamlined for ease-of-use.   The book begins with a seven-point process for examining case studies. Largely lacking from existing case study collections, this framework guides readers through the process of identifying, examining, reflecting on, and taking concrete steps to resolve challenges related to diversity and equity in schools. The cases themselves present everyday examples of the ways in which racism, sexism, homophobia and heterosexism, class inequities, language bias, religious-based oppression, and other equity and diversity concerns affect students, teachers, families, and other members of our school communities.   They involve classroom issues that are relevant to all grade levels and content areas, allowing significant flexibility in how and with whom they are used. Although organized topically, the intersections of these issues are stressed throughout the cases, reflecting the complexities of real-life scenarios. All cases conclude with a series of questions to guide discussion and a section of facilitator notes, called 'Points for Consideration.' This unique feature provides valuable insight for understanding the complexities of each case.   This book is skillfully narrated by Rodney Tompkins.

                "The personal accounts, educator portraits, and research findings assembled by Darrius A. Stanley in  #BlackEducatorsMatter  constitute an unstinting exploration of the experiences of Black K\u201312 teachers in the United States. Spotlighting the invaluable work of Black educators, this volume reveals that although they are underrepresented in educational institutions, they have profound positive influence not only on students of color but also on school climate and on all of society. Contributions from both emerging and established scholars lay out the historical and contemporary issues that confront Black educators. Viewing this landscape through the lens of BlackCrit and other race-centric perspectives, the contributors critically frame and explicitly name the challenges. They make plain that a common thread in the Black experience in United States schools is antiblackness, which remains an endemic feature of United States society even as recent social justice campaigns and public discourse on Critical Race Theory have brought greater awareness to longstanding inequities. This work illuminates the efforts of Black educators to fight oppression and institutionalized racism in schools. It provides strategies that district and school leadership can adopt to recruit, retain, and support Black educators in schools. "

                "In  Cultivating Genius , Dr. Gholdy E. Muhammad presents a four-layered equity framework\u2014one that is grounded in history and restores excellence in literacy education. This framework, which she names Historically Responsive Literacy, was derived from the study of literacy development within 19th-century Black literacy societies. The framework is essential and universal for all students, especially youth of color, who traditionally have been marginalized in learning standards, school policies, and classroom practices. The equity framework will help educators teach and lead toward the following learning goals or pursuits:   Identity development\u2014helping youth to make sense of themselves and others   Skill development\u2014developing proficiencies across the academic disciplines   Intellectual development\u2014gaining knowledge and becoming smarter   Criticality\u2014learning and developing the ability to read texts (including print and social contexts) to understand power, equity, and anti-oppression   When these four learning pursuits are taught together through the Historically Responsive Literacy framework, all students receive profound opportunities for personal, intellectual, and academic success. Muhammad provides probing, self-reflective questions for teachers, leaders, and teacher educators as well as sample culturally and historically responsive sample plans and text sets across grades and content areas.   In this audiobook, Muhammad presents practical approaches to cultivate the genius in students and within teachers. This brand-new audio edition of  Cultivating Genius  is skillfully read by multiple award-winning narrator Adenrele Ojo.

                "The original Visible Learning research concluded that one of the most important influencers of student achievement is how teachers think about learning and their own role. In  Ten Mindframes for Visible Learning , John Hattie and Klaus Zierer define the 10 behaviors or mindframes that teachers need to adopt in order to maximize student success. These include:  thinking of and evaluating your impact on students' learning;   the importance of assessment and feedback for teachers;   working collaboratively and the sense of community;   the notion that learning needs to be challenging;   engaging in dialogue and the correct balance between talking and listening;   conveying the success criteria to learners;   building positive relationships.    These powerful mindframes, which should underpin every action in schools, are founded on the principle that teachers are evaluators, change agents, learning experts, and seekers of feedback who are constantly engaged with dialogue and challenge.   This practical audiobook will show any school exactly how to implement Hattie's mindframes to maximize success. Narrated by listener favorite Brian Arens.   \u00a92018 John Hattie and Klaus Zierer.

                "Anyone who has ever crammed for a test, capitulated to a grade-grubbing student, or fretted over a child's report card knows that the way we assess student learning in American schools is freighted with unintended consequences. As experts agree, our primary assessment technologies\u2014grading, rating, and ranking\u2014don't actually provide an accurate picture of how students are doing in school. Worse, they distort student and educator behavior in ways that undermine learning and exacerbate inequality. Yet despite widespread dissatisfaction, grades, test scores, and transcripts remain the currency of the realm. In  Off the Mark , Jack Schneider and Ethan Hutt explain how we got into this predicament, why we remain beholden to outmoded forms of assessment, and what we can do to change course. They offer a range of practical reforms, like embracing multiple measures of performance and making the so-called permanent record \"overwritable.\" As they explain, we can remake our approach in ways that better advance the three purposes that assessment currently serves: motivating students to learn, communicating meaningful information about what young people know and can do, and synchronizing an otherwise fragmented educational system.  Off the Mark  is a guide for everyone who wants to ensure that assessment serves the fundamental goal of education\u2014helping students learn. "

                "Classroom management is traditionally a matter of encouraging good behavior and discouraging bad by doling out rewards and punishments. But studies show that when educators empower students to address and correct misbehavior among themselves, positive results are longer lasting and wider reaching.   In  Better Than Carrots or Sticks , longtime educators and best-selling authors Dominique Smith, Douglas Fisher, and Nancy Frey provide a practical blueprint for creating a cooperative and respectful classroom climate in which students and teachers work through behavioral issues together.   After a comprehensive overview of the roots of the restorative practices movement in schools, the authors explain how to:  Establish procedures and expectations for student behavior that encourage the development of positive interpersonal skills   Develop a nonconfrontational rapport with even the most challenging students   Implement conflict resolution strategies that prioritize relationship-building and mutual understanding over finger-pointing and retribution   Rewards and punishments may help maintain order in the short term, but they're, at best, superficially effective and, at worst, counterproductive. This audiobook will prepare teachers at all levels to ensure that their classrooms are welcoming, enriching, and constructive environments built on collective respect and focused on student achievement.

Built on research from their popular FourSight\u00ae system\u2014used by Nike, NASA, and Navy SEALs\u2014 Good Team, Bad Team  examines over 6 million data points on why people solve the same problem so differently. The data reveals unconscious problem-solving patterns which, left unmanaged, can cause conflict and stall progress. Once understood, they can help diverse thinkers achieve extraordinary results.  Good Team, Bad Team  is the must-read leadership toolkit for leaders who want their people to take on big challenges\u2014together. "

                "In Educational Pluralism and American Democracy, education policy expert Ashley Rogers Berner envisions a K\u201312 education system that serves both the individual and the common good. Calling for education reform that will enable US public schools to fulfill the longstanding promise of American education, Berner proposes a radical reimagining of both the structure and content of US public school systems. She urges policymakers to embrace educational pluralism, an internationally common model in which the government funds diverse types of schools that deliver more universal content.Providing an incisive assessment of democratic education throughout the world, Berner argues that educational pluralism can build students' exposure to diverse viewpoints and shared knowledge within distinctive school communities. She shows how pluralism steers a middle path that enables equitable access, promotes academic excellence, and avoids the zero-sum games that characterize US education policy.In this thought-provoking proposal, Berner lays out a roadmap for big-picture reform, expertly delineating the mechanisms through which educational norms can change. A practical conclusion describes concrete moves that advocates can pursue to garner support and advance new legislation. "

Moving beyond the abundant resources that focus on DEI theories, Krystal Hardy Allen shows leaders and administrators how to concretely center DEI within both practices and policies, as well as how to do the interpersonal work of becoming a self-aware and equity-focused leader. With these resources, you'll learn how to ensure that DEI is embedded in your strategic planning to create schools and education organizations that are transformative, inclusive, and equitable for both children and adults. Drawing on her own school leadership and international educational consultant experience, Allen teaches you to better understand your role as a leader within your school or district's DEI work; prioritize an equity-informed view, policies, and practices within different areas of teacher development, school operations and finance, parent engagement, student culture, school board governance, and more; clarify the relationship between DEI and your schools' or district's mission, vision, values, and goals; and build an effective strategic plan at the school or district level that provides both guidance and accountability to your school or district's DEI journey.

But you find yourself thinking \"I am not a data person.\" Yes, you are. Or can be with the help of Amelia Parnell. You Are a Data Person provides context for the levels at which you are currently comfortable using data, helps you identify both the areas where you should strengthen your knowledge and where you can use this knowledge in your particular university role. For example, the rising cost to deliver high-quality programs and services to students has pushed many institutions to reallocate resources to find efficiencies. In addition to programs, services, and pedagogy, professionals are constantly monitoring the rates at which students are entering, remaining enrolled in, and leaving the institution, as those movements impact the institution's financial position. From teaching professors to student affairs personnel and beyond, Parnell offers tangible examples of how professionals can make data contributions at their current and future knowledge level, and will even inspire listeners to take the initiative to engage in data projects.

It's no secret that our government-run public education system has held generations of Americans hostage. The teachers unions\u2014the government's stormtroopers\u2014have been hard at work running a mass misinformation campaign to convince parents that because this is how it has always been, this is how it has to be. But here's what you may not realize: the parents are winning, and we have entered the death spiral of the education dictatorship. The school choice revolution is here, and moms and dads are successfully restoring parental rights in education, one state, one school district at a time.    In  The Parent Revolution , Dr. Corey A. DeAngelis\u2013public enemy #1 of the teachers' unions \u2013 takes readers inside this movement like no one else can. As Vox reported in late 2023, DeAngelis has become \"the public face\" of the effort, \"traveling from state to state, holding rallies, making media appearances, and tweeting constantly.\" Or as another education voice put it, \"No one in education policy, advocacy, or activism has ever lived rent-free in more heads at once than Corey DeAngelis.\"    As America's most prominent and influential advocate of school choice, DeAngelis unapologetically argues why parents and political leaders must lean into the culture war taking place in schools. He exposes the hypocritical elites who are content to hold other people's children captive to poorly run government schools while sending their own children to the best private and charter schools out there. And most importantly, he equips readers with the ability to make sure the potent forces of the educational industrial complex don't regain their footing. "

                "We all want our students to feel safe, collaborate well with others, feel ownership for their learning, and be joyfully engaged in their work. Nevertheless, many teachers end up using language patterns that undermine these goals. Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?    We want students to take responsibility for their learning, yet we use language that implies teacher ownership.   We want to build positive relationships with students, yet we use sarcasm when we get frustrated.   We want students to think learning is fun, yet we sometimes make comments that suggest the opposite.   We want students to exhibit good behavior because it's the right thing to do, yet we rely on threats and bribes, which implies students don't naturally want to be good.  What teachers say to students - when they praise or discipline, give directions or ask questions, and introduce concepts or share stories - affects student learning and behavior. A slight change in intonation can also dramatically change how language feels for students. In  What We Say and How We Say It Matter , Mike Anderson digs into the nuances of language in the classroom. This audiobook's many examples will help teachers examine their language habits and intentionally improve their classroom practice so their language matches and supports their goals. Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont.  \u00a92019 ASCD \u00a7. "

                "From Stanford professor, author of Limitless Mind, youcubed.org founder, and leading expert in the field of mathematics education Jo Boaler comes a groundbreaking guide to finding joy and understanding by adopting a diverse approach to learning math.    \"Every once in a while, someone revolutionizes an approach to a difficult subject and changes it forever. That is what Jo Boaler has done for math. Fresh, smart, and inclusive, Jo Boaler's strategy eschews the one-size-fits-a-few approach and instead allows math to be seen and solved by everyone. A huge achievement. Math-ish is the only math book I've ever enjoyed reading in my entire life. Honestly.\" -Bonnie Garmus, author of Lessons in Chemistry   Mathematics is a fundamental part of life, yet every one of us has a unique relationship with learning and understanding the subject. Working with numbers may inspire confidence in our abilities or provoke anxiety and trepidation. Stanford researcher, mathematics education professor, and the leading expert on math learning Dr. Jo Boaler argues that our differences are the key to unlocking our greatest mathematics potential.  In Math-ish, Boaler shares new neuroscientific research on how embracing the concept of \"math-ish\"\u2014a theory of mathematics as it exists in the real world\u2014changes the way we think about mathematics, data, and ourselves. When we can see the value of diversity among people and multi-faceted approaches to learning math, we are free to truly flourish. Utilizing the latest research on math education, Jo guides us through seven principles that can radically reframe our relationship with the subject:    The power of mindset on learning    Utilizing a visual approach to math    The impact of physical movement and communication on understanding    Understanding the value of an \"\"ish\"\" perspective - in mathematics and beyond    The importance of connected and flexible knowledge    New data on diverse teaching modes that work with different learning styles, not against them    The value of diversity in learning mathematics\u2014and beyond  When mathematics is approached more broadly, inclusively, and with a greater sense of wonder and play\u2014when we value the different ways people see, approach, and understand it\u2014we empower ourselves and gain a beneficial understanding of its value in our lives .   ?Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.

                "The urgent, revelatory story of how a school board win for the conservative right in one Texas suburb inspired a Christian nationalist campaign now threatening to undermine public education in America\u2014from an NBC investigative reporter and co-creator of the Peabody Award\u2013winning and Pulitzer Prize finalist Southlake podcast.    Award-winning journalist Mike Hixenbaugh delivers the immersive and eye-opening story of Southlake, Texas, a district that seemed to offer everything parents would want for their children\u2014small classes, dedicated teachers, financial resources, a track record of academic success, and school spirit in abundance. All this, until a series of racist incidents became public, a plan to promote inclusiveness was proposed in response\u2014and a coordinated, well-funded conservative backlash erupted, lighting the fire of a national movement on the verge of changing the face of public schools across the country.  They Came for the Schools pulls back the curtain on the powerful forces driving this crusade to ban books, rewrite curricula, limit rights for minority and LGBTQ students\u2014and, most importantly, to win what Hixenbaugh's deeply informed reporting convinces is the holy grail among those seeking to impose biblical values on American society: school privatization, one school board and one legal battle at a time.  They Came for the Schools delivers an essential take on Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, as they demean public schools and teachers and boost the Christian right's vision. Hixenbaugh brings to light fascinating connections between this political and cultural moment and past fundamentalist campaigns to censor classroom lessons. Finally, They Came for the Schools traces the rise of a new resistance movement led by a diverse coalition of student activists, fed-up educators, and parents who are beginning to win select battles of their own: a blueprint, they hope, for gaining inclusive and civil schools for all.

Boyden, who died in 1972, was the school's headmaster for sixty-six years. John McPhee portrays a remarkable man \"at the near end of a skein of magnanimous despots who...created enduring schools through their own individual energies, maintained them under their own absolute rule, and left them forever imprinted with their own personalities.\" More than simply a portrait of the Headmaster of Deerfield Academy, it is a revealing look at the nature of private school education in America.

Chance is shown to play a crucial role in shaping outcomes across history, throughout the natural world, and in our everyday lives. In The Random Factor, Mark Robert Rank draws from a wealth of evidence, including interviews and research, to explain how luck and chance play out and reveals how we can use these lessons to guide our personal lives and public policies. This book traverses luck from macro to micro, from events like the Cuban Missile Crisis to our personal encounters and relationships. Rank also delves into the class and race dynamics of chance, emphasizing the stark disparities it brings to light. This transformative book prompts a new understanding of the twists and turns in our daily lives and encourages readers to fully appreciate the surprising world of randomness in which we live.\"A fantastic read. Mark Robert Rank deftly brings together insights from a wide range of studies and everyday experiences to show the underappreciated role that randomness plays in all aspects of social life. Accessible and entertaining, the book provides a valuable new perspective on contemporary inequality.\"\u2014Michael Sauder, Professor and Chair, Department of Sociology and Criminology, University of Iowa.

                "If we hope to share our planet successfully with one another and the AI systems we are creating, we must reflect on who we are, how we got here, and where we are heading. The Importance of Being Educable puts forward a provocative new exploration of the extraordinary facility of humans to absorb and apply knowledge. The remarkable \"educability\" of the human brain can be understood as an information processing ability. It sets our species apart, enables the civilization we have, and gives us the power and potential to set our planet on a steady course. While we can readily absorb systems of thought about worlds of experience beyond our own, we struggle to judge correctly what information we should trust. In this visionary book, Leslie Valiant argues that understanding the nature of our own educability is crucial to safeguarding our future. After breaking down how we process information to learn and apply knowledge, and drawing comparisons with other animals and AI systems, he explains why education should be humankind's central preoccupation. Will the unique capability that has been so foundational to our achievements and civilization continue to drive our progress, or will we fall victim to our vulnerabilities? If we want to protect our collective future, we must better understand and prioritize the importance of being educable. "

                "A mother and race scholar seeks to answer her daughter\u2019s many questions about race and racism with an earnest exploration into race relations and affirmative action from the perspectives of Asian Americans  Before being struck down by the US Supreme Court in June 2023, affirmative action remained one of the few remaining policy tools to address racial inequalities, revealing peculiar contours of racism and anti-racist strategies in America. Through personal reflective essays for and about her daughter, OiYan Poon looks at how the debate over affirmative action reveals the divergent ways Asian Americans conceive of their identity. With moving sincerity and insightful study, Poon combines extensive research with personal narratives from both herself and a diverse swath of individuals across the Asian American community to reflect on and respond to her daughter\u2019s central question: What does it mean to be Asian American? Poon conducts interviews with Asian Americans throughout the US who have been actively engaged in policy debates over race-conscious admissions or affirmative action. Through these exchanges, she finds that Asian American identity remains deeply unsettled in a contest between those invested in reaching the top of the racial hierarchy alongside whiteness and those working toward a vision of justice and humanity co-constructed through cross-racial solidarity. Poon uses these contrasting viewpoints to guide her conversations with her daughter, providing a heartfelt and optimistic look at how understanding the diversity and nuances of the Asian American experience can help us envision a more equitable future.

Their experience, expertise, insight, and enthusiasm for language teaching translate into a book that is refreshingly practical for teachers, especially teachers who are striving to break from traditional drills commonly presented in textbooks. I hope this book finds its way into the hands of every language teacher who is looking for concrete examples of how SLA principles meet the realities of the classroom.\" -Stacey Margarita Johnson, Vanderbilt University.

These \"attentional resources\" are not about how smart we are but about how much of our brain power is available to us for the task at hand. When bandwidth is taken up by the stress of persistent economic insecurity or the negative experiences of racism, classism, homophobia, religious intolerance, sexism, ableism, etc., there is less available for learning and growth. This is as true for young children and youth as for their parents and teachers. Cia Verschelden describes strategies that can help students recover bandwidth, including acknowledging the \"funds of knowledge\" of students and their families, promoting growth mindsets, using reflective practices to build a sense of belonging for all students, fostering peer collaboration, and implementing restorative practices in lieu of punitive measures. She offers practical ideas for creating more teacher-supportive systems and addresses how administrators can harness teachers' ideas to create inclusive learning environments for all students. All of us have a stake in a public school system from which students emerge as fully-formed learners and thinkers and who believe in their ability to affect what happens to them and their communities.

                "Since the 2002 implementation of No Child Left Behind, the American public education system has been fundamentally changed. Excessive testing, standardized curriculums, destructive demands on children, corporate-\u00adstyle evaluations, and top-\u00addown mandates have become the norm. In response, record numbers of demoralized educators have quit, and millions of students have been left educationally impoverished. This troubling transformation has been exhaustively critiqued by scholars and commentators. Yet one crucial voice has been missing. In Testing Education, Kathy Greeley recounts the impact of education reform from a teacher's point of view. Based on a teaching career ranging nearly forty years, Greeley details how schools went from learning communities infused with excitement, intellectual stimulation, and joy to sterile spaces of stress, intimidation, and fear. In this ultimately hopeful memoir, Greeley asks us to learn from the past to reimagine the future of public education. "

We all want to make great decisions. So what happens between our good intentions and the choices we actually make in the moment? If only we could make decisions ahead of time rather than when we're under stress, overwhelmed, or swayed by fear or emotion. In Think Ahead, we learn how to do just that.  Pastor Craig Groeschel knows from personal experience and as a counselor to others what being trapped in a cycle of poor decision-making is like. In Think Ahead, he shares what he has discovered about the power of \"pre-deciding.\"  With thought-provoking exercises and questions for reflection, this interactive book teaches us that the quality of our decisions determines the quality of our lives. Think Ahead will help you:  Understand the science behind your decision-making habits  Overcome decision fatigue and debilitating fears  Diminish the role of emotions in decision-making  See how your small choices shape the kind of person you become  Define and put into action the seven life-defining pre-decisions you can make today     Becoming the person you want to be starts before you even make a decision. In Think Ahead, you'll discover the power of making decisions today to help you live the life you want to have tomorrow. "

In Broken, Dr. Paul LeBlanc, president of Southern New Hampshire University, draws on his experience working in one such system-education-to reconnect us to the human facets of serving people. In doing so, he charts a course for rebuilding and reinhabiting better systems across education, healthcare, criminal justice, government, and more. The United States spends enormous sums on helping people-$3.8 trillion on healthcare, $182 billion on prisons, and $604 billion on higher education-and yet these systems routinely fail us. When we seek to improve how they function, our efforts focus on policy debates, technical solutions, funding, and data. But if these systems are to truly improve, we have to start with the human values that fuel decision making. Broken explores the deeply human dimensions we must consider-aspiring, discovering, mattering-if we want to rebuild the policies, technologies, processes, and, most importantly, the heart we use to serve people.

                "The end of World War II led to the United States' emergence as a global superpower. For Western Europe it marked the beginning of decades of unprecedented cooperation and prosperity that one historian has labeled \"the long peace.\" Yet half a world away, in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, and Malaya-the fighting never really stopped, as these regions sought to completely sever the yoke of imperialism and colonialism with all-too-violent consequences. East and Southeast Asia quickly became the most turbulent regions of the globe. Within weeks of the famous surrender ceremony aboard the USS Missouri, civil war, communal clashes, and insurgency engulfed the continent, from Southeast Asia to the Soviet border. By early 1947, full-scale wars were raging in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Within a decade after the Japanese surrender, almost all of the countries of South, East, and Southeast Asia that had formerly been conquests of the Japanese or colonies of the European powers experienced wars and upheavals that resulted in the deaths of at least 2.5 million combatants and millions of civilians. With A Continent Erupts, acclaimed military historian Ronald H. Spector draws on letters, diaries, and international archives to provide a comprehensive military history and analysis of these little-known but decisive events. "

A powerful guide to successful, transformative entrepreneurship for the under-represented from Eric Collins, host of the award-winning Channel 4 reality business show  The Money Maker.   At a time when half of Black households in the UK live in persistent poverty - over twice as many as their white counterparts -  We   Don't Need Permission  argues that investing in Black and under-represented entrepreneurs in order to create successful businesses is the surest, fastest socio-economic game-changer there is. Durable empowerment - from education to health outcomes - is key to solving the multiple problems that result from systemic racism and sexism. And it is the best way to close the inequality gaps that have hampered and continue to hinder Black people and all women too. To address this problem head on, Eric Collins co-founded venture capital firm Impact X Capital to invest in under-represented entrepreneurs in the UK and Europe. In  We Don't Need Permission , Collins identifies ten key principles of successful entrepreneurship, and reveals how it's possible to change a system that has helped some, while holding others back. The book not only aims to inspire and motivate under-represented people to take their future and economic destiny into their own hands, but will demand of current business leaders and organizations that they do business better. It's time to stop waiting for someone else to give permission, Collins tells us, and start boldly making the world we want to see.  'Eric Collins is one of the most powerful business people in Britain.'  The Times   \u00a9 Eric Collins 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022. "

Matthew Kay and Jennifer Orr take on these questions and more in We're Gonna Keep On Talking: How to Lead Meaningful Race Conversations in the Elementary Classroom. This book focuses on the unique and powerful role discussions about race can play in the elementary classroom. Drawing its title inspiration from the freedom song \"Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around,\" sung by hundreds of children marching against segregation in the Children's Crusade of 1963, We're Gonna Keep On Talking is written for teachers who are willing to match children's courage and brilliance. Writing with the humility and honest storytelling of two career classroom teachers, Matthew Kay and Jennifer Orr share: - Strategies for building safe and supportive classroom and school spaces for productive discourse - Dozens of practical teacher moves for facilitating race conversations - Classroom stories that allow listeners to envision ways into the work through picture books, art, graphs, and current events.

                "While efforts to achieve equity in education are prominent in school districts across this country, the effective implementation that results in meaningful change remains elusive. Even with access to compelling theories and approaches such as multicultural education, culturally responsive teaching, culturally relevant instruction, culturally sustaining pedagogy, schools still struggle to implement equitable change that reshapes the academic experiences of students marginalized by the prevailing history, culture, and traditions in public education. In Belonging through a Culture of Dignity, Cobb and Krownapple argue that the cause of these struggles are largely based on the failure of educators to consider the foundational elements upon which educational equity is based, belonging and dignity. Once these fundamental human needs are understood, educators can gain clarity of the barriers to meaningful student relationships, especially across dimensions of difference such as race, class, and culture. Cobb and Krownapple challenge that normalization and offer three concepts as keys to successful equity initiatives: inclusion, belonging, and dignity. Through their work, the authors aim to equip educators with the tools necessary to deliver the promise of democracy through schools by breaking the cycle of equity dysfunction once and for all. "

Authors Marie-Nathalie Beaudoin and Gerald Monk tap into cutting edge discoveries on mindfulness, interpersonal neurobiology, and positive psychology. Each chapter offers a wealth of clinical questions and embodied exercises, while \"conversation maps\"-which provide important guideposts to practitioners-are illustrated with engaging transcripts of therapeutic work. These compelling case studies elegantly demonstrate how skillful conversations can invigorate hope and support personal development. Listeners will discover a wide variety of ways to assist clients of all ages in reengaging with a meaningful life and sustaining well-being. "

He takes to task the perception of urban youth of color as unteachable, and he challenges educators to embrace and respect each student\u2019s culture and to reimagine the classroom as a site where roles are reversed and students become the experts in their own learning.  Putting forth his theory of Reality Pedagogy, Emdin provides practical tools to unleash the brilliance and eagerness of youth and educators alike\u2014both of whom have been typecast and stymied by outdated modes of thinking about urban education. With this fresh and engaging new pedagogical vision, Emdin demonstrates the importance of creating a family structure and building communities within the classroom, using culturally relevant strategies like hip-hop music and call-and-response, and connecting the experiences of urban youth to indigenous populations globally. Merging real stories with theory, research, and practice, Emdin demonstrates how by implementing the \u201cSeven Cs\u201d of reality pedagogy in their own classrooms, urban youth of color benefit from truly transformative education.

Willpower and grit may improve achievement for Black people in school, but they don't secure our belonging. In fact, the very structure of higher education ensures that we're treated as guests, outsiders to the institutional family\u2014outnumbered and unwelcome. In this compelling exploration of what it means to be a Black woman pursuing higher education, Dr. Jasmine L. Harris moves beyond the \"data points\" to examine the day-to-day impacts of racism in education on Black women as individuals, the longer-term consequences to our personal and professional lives, and the generational costs to our entire families. \"I want to arm as many Black girls and women as I can with the knowledge about these spaces that I lacked,\" says Dr. Harris. \"By laying bare my own traumas, and those of Black women before me, I am providing them the tools to protect themselves, with an understanding of how deliberately many institutions will try to undercut them.\" Trial and error have been required of Black students to navigate systems of discrimination and disadvantage. But this book now offers useful support, illuminating the community of Black women dealing with similar issues. The author's story is not unusual, nor are her interactions anomalies. Black Women, Ivory Tower explores why. "

North of Dallas, a conservative white family relocates to an affluent suburban enclave, but can\u2019t escape the changes sweeping the country. On Chicago\u2019s North Shore, a multiracial mom joins an ultraprogressive challenge to the town\u2019s liberal status quo. In Compton, California, whose suburban roots are now barely recognizable, undocumented Hispanic parents place their gifted son\u2019s future in the hands of educators at a remarkable elementary school. And outside Pittsburgh, a Black mother moves to the same street where author Benjamin Herold grew up, then confronts the destructive legacy left behind by white families like his.  Disillusioned  braids these human stories together with penetrating local and national history to reveal a vicious cycle undermining the dreams upon which American suburbia was built. For generations, upwardly mobile white families have extracted opportunity from the nation\u2019s heavily subsidized suburbs, then moved on before the bills for maintenance and repair came due, leaving the mostly Black and Brown families who followed to clean up the ensuing mess. But now, sweeping demographic shifts and the dawning realization that endless expansion is no longer feasible are disrupting this pattern, forcing everyday families to confront a truth their communities were designed to avoid: The suburban lifestyle dream is a Ponzi scheme whose unraveling threatens us all. How do we come to terms with this troubled history? How do we build a future in which all children can thrive? \u00a0Drawing upon his decorated career as an education journalist, Herold explores these pressing debates with expertise and perspective. Then, alongside Bethany Smith\u2014the mother from his old neighborhood, who contributes a powerful epilogue to the book\u2014he offers a hopeful path toward renewal. The result is nothing short of a journalistic masterpiece. "

The inspiration one draws from every page of this book is an enhanced sense of what is possible. It revives the very thing we need most in these times: hope.\" -Claude M. Steele, author of Whistling Vivaldi Discover the secret to flourishing in an age of division: belonging. In a world filled with discord and loneliness, finding harmony and happiness can be difficult. But what if the key to unlocking our potential lies in this deceptively simple concept? Belonging is the feeling of being a part of a group that values, respects, and cares for us-a feeling that we can all cultivate in even the smallest corners of social life. In Belonging: The Science of Creating Connection and Bridging Divides, Stanford University professor Geoffrey L. Cohen draws on his own and others' groundbreaking scientific research to offer simple, concrete solutions for fostering a sense of belonging. These solutions can generate surprisingly significant and long-lasting benefits. Small but powerful actions can bolster belonging-actions such as encouraging people to reflect on their core values before they face a challenge or expressing belief in someone's capacity to reach a higher standard. A wide range of innovative approaches have been found to boost achievement at work and at school, bridge political divides, reduce prejudice, and even contribute to overall health. Rigorously tested in diverse arenas-from classrooms to disadvantaged neighborhoods to iconic Silicon Valley companies-these methods offer a path forward in these demanding times. Belonging is a compelling book for all who yearn for a more connected world, whether you're a manager or employee, an educator or student, a parent or caregiver, or simply someone seeking to make the most out of every moment you spend with others. Packed with actionable insights and specific strategies, this book offers hope and practical guidance, serving as both an inspiration and a roadmap to creating a world of inclusion, understanding, and empathy.

                "Generations of Americans have regarded schools as essential for developing the knowledge and civic values necessary for sustaining democracy. Yet, as Matthew D. Nelsen argues in The Color of Civics, traditional approaches to civic education are not living up to their promise for many students, particularly students of color from disadvantaged communities. Drawing on lessons from students and teachers in Chicago, The Color of Civics reimagines the democratic purpose of civic education. Nelsen's findings challenge some of the most widely cited civic education research, arguing that the content of traditional civic education courses privileges the political experiences of white political actors, and in turn, contributes to divergent political behaviors and participatory outcomes across racial and ethnic groups. He presents a new approach to civic education that aims to foster political empowerment by centering historically-grounded conversations about current events as well as critical categories of knowledge-those that highlight the agency of marginalized groups. This approach increases rates of political participation among young people of color and heightens political empathy among white youth. Nelsen also explores how the attitudes and lived experiences of teachers drive the implementation of more empowering civic learning environments. "

                "A highly accessible and easily adaptable conceptual framework that helps educational leaders plan, leverage, and sustain change as they create more equitable schools. In Navigating Social Justice, Martin Scanlan introduces a comprehensive social justice schema that melds organizational learning with leading for equity. Scanlan distills wisdom gleaned from the experiences of a variety of educational professionals as well as from his own more than three decades of work in equity-focused partnership with elementary schools. Scanlan's schema brings together five dimensions-inclusivity, communities of practice, critical formation, social ecosystems, and practical wisdom-that work together holistically to eradicate inequitable practices and policies and promote robust teaching and inclusive learning. For each dimension, the book features real-life vignettes that focus the conversation, exercises that encourage reflection, and suggested opportunities for the application of its central ideas. Each chapter also gives access to online tools, extending its utility. The practical guidance offered in this book not only will enable educational institutions to best meet the needs of families and community members but will also help leaders cultivate the moral and intellectual judgment needed to address social justice issues in schools.

He argues that meaningful instruction on this urgent issue of our time must focus on climate justice-the convergence of climate change and social justice-in a way that is emotionally safe, developmentally appropriate, and ultimately empowering. Drawing on examples of real-life educators teaching climate change, Roderick identifies eight key dimensions of climate education that will prepare students to face the challenges of the climate crisis and give them the means to take action. These dimensions include not only educating for a deep understanding of the scientific, geopolitical, and socioeconomic equity issues that surround global warming, but also cultivating appreciation for the environment, building a supportive community, and fostering active hope for the future. In support of this crucial endeavor, Roderick suggests evidence-based teaching strategies, practices that promote inclusivity, and tools for social and emotional learning. This timely and uplifting book lays out a powerful vision for teaching, learning, and curriculum development to nurture a generation of courageous, informed advocates for climate justice. "

Hess offers a pithy and perceptive appraisal of American schooling and finds, in the uncertain period following pandemic disruption, an ideal moment to reimagine US education. Now is the time, he asserts, to ask hard questions about how schools use time and talent, how they work with parents, what they do with digital tools, and how they meet the needs of their communities. As Hess explains, to rethink is to acknowledge the realities of the education system while opening one's mind to possibility. With characteristic verve and wit, Hess guides listeners through his rethink process, a versatile and easily implemented approach to identifying issues and brainstorming possible responses. He encourages listeners to explore what improvements might alleviate current pressures and frustrations, such as teacher shortages and burnout, declining student performance, and compromised learning time. Whether their goal is to achieve better student engagement, increase parent involvement, or implement personalized learning, listeners will develop the mindset to ask the right questions, to fully understand the problem that's being solved, and to evaluate the probable effectiveness of proposed solutions.

                "Writing and sharing fiction allows adolescents to glimpse other lives The current curricular emphasis on analytical writing can make it feel risky to teach creative writing in ELA classrooms. But the opportunity to write fiction in school opens many doors for young people: doors the author argues are critical to the development of our students, our education system, and even our democracy. This book will delight English teachers weary of focusing relentlessly on argument and information writing. Veteran teacher Ariel Sacks vividly describes the many academic, social-emotional, and community-building advantages of teaching imaginative writing in the classroom, not least of which is the impact it has on equity for marginalized students. Her book is a teacher-to-teacher text that folds in detailed, practical guidance about how to design lessons and meet standards, while presenting a powerful central argument: that the writing of fiction should be treated not as a luxury for some, but as a center of the English curriculum for all students.

                "In the United States, a majority of students graduate below proficiency in all academic subjects. Parents of struggling students feel overwhelmed and confused about how to help their children simply survive school, let alone succeed. Various school reform efforts have been tried and all have failed. But all hope is not lost. A science exists that allows children to learn as individuals even though at school they are educated in groups. One that avoids senseless labels that sentence children to lifetimes of failure and mediocrity. Dr. Kimberly Berens and a team of scientists have spent the last 20 years perfecting a powerful system of instruction based on the learning, behavioral, and cognitive sciences that they call Fit Learning. This method of teaching has been proven to markedly improve how students understand and achieve, even for children who have been told they have learning disabilities or other disorders that interfere with their ability to learn.Blind Spots reveals the history of our broken education system and shows that by using this teaching system in the classroom, we can unlock the vast potential hidden within every child.

Far less known are the university's roots in plunder, warfare, and the promotion of white supremacy. As Tony Platt shows in The Scandal of Cal, these original sins sit at the center of UC Berkeley's history. Platt looks unflinchingly at the university's desecration of graves and large-scale hoarding of Indigenous remains. He tracks its role in developing the racist pseudoscience of eugenics in the early twentieth century. He sheds light on the school's complicity with the military-industrial complex and its incubation of unprecedented violence through the Manhattan Project. And he underscores its deliberate and continued evasions about its own wrongdoings, which echo in the institution's decision-making up to the present day. This book, above all, illuminates Cal's culpability in some of the cruelest chapters of US history and sounds a clarion call for the university to undertake a thorough and earnest reckoning with its past. It is a must-listen for Cal alumni, students, faculty, and staff, and for anyone concerned with the impact of higher education in the United States and beyond. "

Fortunately, college is not America's only option. In Apprentice Nation, education and workforce expert Ryan Craig explores how a modern apprenticeship system will allow students and job seekers to jumpstart their careers by learning while they earn\u2014ultimately leading to greater economic opportunity, workforce diversity, and geographic mobility. Listeners will learn -The history behind America's outdated college system. -Why apprenticeships are such an effective pathway to career opportunity. -Why America lags so far behind other countries when it comes to apprenticeship opportunities and what we can do to catch up. -Where students and job seekers can go to land an apprenticeship. With an easy-to-reference directory of US apprenticeship programs by industry and geography, Craig's Apprentice Nation is an accessible blueprint for a country where young Americans of all backgrounds can launch careers in tech, healthcare, finance, and more\u2014without losing four critical, career-building years and tens of thousands to college tuition and student loans. With just a few common-sense changes to education and workforce development, an apprentice nation will place the American Dream within reach\u2014for everyone. "

At Jackson State, he wanted to dominate and win.... Nothing has changed but the address. He wants to dominate and win a national championship at Colorado.\" (from Coach Prime)   Known for decades as one of the NFL's most iconic and spectacular playmakers, Deion Sanders remains college football's most intriguing newsmaker. In just three years, he has become the most talked about coach by recruiting elite players to moribund programs and reviving the spirit and pride of forgotten fanbases by winning. Along the way, he's changing how we think about college sports while rejuvenating whole communities with the national attention that follows him and the fresh commerce a winning culture ignites.  First at Jackson State and now at Colorado, Sanders has displayed a knack for leading miraculous turnarounds of once-storied-but-long-irrelevant programs. Television cameras turn up for national broadcasts, gameday attendance skyrockets, economic impact reaches the tens of millions, and NFL scouts take renewed interest.  Meanwhile, off the field, Sanders displays an uncanny ability to connect with his players. Weekly chat sessions about life and love are the norm. His unyielding commitment to guiding his players to become exceptional men raises the bar on what parents and athletes expect from college coaches.  Now, with access no other reporter has been granted, veteran sports journalist Jean-Jacques Taylor takes readers inside one season with Deion Sanders to show the heart, mind, and culture of America's most innovative football coach and his team of would-be champions.

                "Eva Moskowitz, founder of the highly lauded Success Academy Charter Schools, shares her advice for raising smart, successful, and intellectually engaged children.   Eva Moskowitz has built a national reputation as the founder and leader of Success Academy Charter Schools, one of the country's most highly regarded networks of schools, but while most people know Eva for her success in educating 20,000 mainly low-income students who are routinely accepted to our nation's best universities, she has also been responsible for raising three children of her own. In A+ Parenting, Eva shares what she has learned both as a parent and an educator about raising children to be enthusiastic and successful learners.  Eva's most important message is that parents can and should play a critical role in their children's intellectual development. Each year, children only spend about 180 days in school; how they spend the remaining 185 days is up to their parents. Children who continue to learn when they are out of school will make far more progress than those who don't, but parents need not attempt to recreate school at home. Instead, they can encourage their children to engage in fun activities that will have a huge impact on their creativity, intellectual curiosity, and attention span.   A+ Parenting is every parent's must-have guide to enriching every aspect of a child's life, from the morning carpool to the soccer field to the dinner table\u2014without having to hire tutors or carve out more hours in the day. Moskowitz explains how to take the time you're already spending with your children and make it more fulfilling and intellectually stimulating for them. The book is full of practical guidance such as:  Which extracurricular activities are best for a child's development.  How children can learn by watching movies and playing games\u2014and why you should reach for chess or Monopoly over checkers or Candyland.  How to help your child overcome a learning disability and ensure it doesn't undermine their self-confidence.  Why getting angry at children doesn't work but expressing disappointment does.  In addition to advice, this book is filled with carefully curated lists of educational activities, including games to play, movies to watch, puzzles to solve, books to read, music to listen to, and experiments to perform. These activities, supported with love and joy, are all parents need to turn their children into lifelong learners.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

BIPOC dropout rates and levels of stress and anxiety have linked with non-inclusive school environments. In this collection, three educators draw on their experiences as immigrants and educators to address racial inequity in the classroom and provide a thorough analysis of different strategies that create an inclusive classroom. White educators that serve BIPOC students will benefit from these reflections on incorporating culturally relevant pedagogies that value the diverse experiences of students. With a focus on Haitian and Dominican students in the United States, the authors reveal the challenges that immigrant and first-generation students face. They also offer insights about topics such as: - How do language policies and social justice intersect? - How can educators use culturally relevant teaching and community funds of knowledge to enrich curriculum? - How can educators center the needs of the student within the classroom? - How can educators support Haitian Creole-speaking students?.

                "A personal and professional guide to the latest research on imposterism and psychological flexibility, IMPOSTER NO MORE is the professional's handbook to combating \"impostor syndrome\" and overcoming self-doubt to achieve career success.   Dr. Jill Stoddard is a recovered imposter. For years, she was convinced that the only reason she was accepted into a competitive grad school program was because her father knew the program director. Dr. Stoddard isn't alone in this: deep down, the majority of successful people question their professional legitimacy a good amount of the time.   Why do we do this, and how can we stop? Although she's in recovery, Dr. Stoddard still struggles with feelings of imposterism. She works through them with psychological flexibility, the ability to be present with all thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and urges, fully and without defense, while making conscious, deliberate choices based on what deeply matters to a person. Essentially, we're not attempting to change the substance of the thoughts and feelings that naturally occur to us; instead, we change the way we  relate  to those thoughts and feelings, so we aren't caught up in constant battle to control them.   Throughout  Imposter No More , Dr. Stoddard lays the groundwork for understanding the imposter phenomenon; she outlines the traps professionals often fall into regarding their imposter feelings, and provides actionable steps for cultivating psychological flexibility to be able to choose bold career moves despite self-doubt and imposterism.

In this new book, Liz Wheeler exposes where the forces of wokeness are at work and explains how parents can fight back for a change. Everything is on the line. Despite the occasional victory, conservatives are on the defensive on every front of the culture wars, especially America's schools. Planned Parenthood is funding gender theory indoctrination, groomer teachers are introducing youngsters to pornography, Disney executives are bragging about their \"queerness agenda,\" and teacher's unions are poisoning young minds with racism. If someone doesn't stand up and fight, these ideas will be the norm for a new generation. A distressing number of parents refuse to see how depraved our schools have become. The next generation will determine the fate of the American experiment in ordered liberty. Will they pass it on to their children, or will we lose our nation forever? Parents and their allies must go on the offensive in this existential fight. Fortunately, they have the truth on their side. It is not too late. "

Team development is an art form, and this book is your how-to guide to doing it effectively. You'll learn the administrative tasks that keep your team on track. Just as importantly, you'll explore what it means to be the kind of leader that can bring people together to accomplish difficult tasks. You'll find practical suggestions, tools, and clear instructions for the logistics of team development as well as for building trust, developing healthy communication, and managing conflict. You'll find concrete guidance on: designing agendas, making decisions, establishing effective protocols, and more; boosting your resilience, understanding and managing your emotions, and meeting your goals; cultivating your team's emotional intelligence and dealing with cynicism; and utilizing practical tools to create a customized framework for developing highly effective teams.
