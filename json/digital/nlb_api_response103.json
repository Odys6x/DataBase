[and] brilliant pairings of picture and word (and word with word).\"\u2014The Wall Street Journal   The hero had super vision. The hero had supervision.  Man, a tea sounds great. Manatee sounds great!  Sir Francis Bacon Sir, France is bakin'!  What is going on here?! You can't believe everything you hear! A single word can have many different meanings. And sometimes two words that sound alike can be spelled completely differently. Ptolemy the pterodactyl is back to show us all how absurd and fun language can be when homophones, homonyms, and tricky punctuation are at play!  No Reading Allowed allows children and their parents to laugh together while also learning something new. Perfect for baby gifts, birthday gifts, teacher gifts, and anyone who finds humor in the absurdity of the English language. "

Written in the voice of the son, who was eight years old in 1881 when he immigrated to America with his father, this is their story.   Rafael Guastavino Sr. was 39 when he left a successful career as an architect in Barcelona. American cities\u2014densely packed and built largely of wood\u2014were experiencing horrific fires, and Guastavino had the solution: The soaring interior spaces created by his tiled vaults and domes made buildings sturdier, fireproof, and beautiful. What he didn't have was fluent English. Unable to win design commissions, he transferred control of the company to his American-educated son, whose subsequent half-century of inspired design work resulted in major contributions to the built environment of America.     Immigrant Architect  is an introduction to architectural concepts and a timely reminder of immigrant contributions to America. The book includes four route maps for visiting Guastavino-designed spaces in New York City: uptown, midtown, downtown, and Prospect Park. "

When she came to America in 1921, Pura Belpr\u00e9 carried the cuentos folkl\u00f3ricos of her Puerto Rican homeland. Finding a new home at the New York Public Library as a bilingual assistant, she turned her popular retellings into libros and spread story seeds across the land. Today, these seeds have grown into a lush landscape as generations of children and storytellers continue to share her tales and celebrate Pura's legacy.  Brought to colorful life by Paola Escobar's elegant and exuberant illustrations and Anika Aldamuy Denise's lyrical text, this gorgeous book is perfect for the pioneers in your life.  Informative backmatter and suggested further reading included.  A Spanish-language edition, Sembrando historias: Pura Belpr\u00e9: bibliotecaria y narradora de cuentos, is also available.   \"Anika Aldamuy Denise's intimate telling captures the magical, folk-tale feeling of Belpr\u00e9's own stories. Her lyrical text, sprinkled like fairy dust with Spanish words, begs to be read aloud, while Paola Escobar's stylishly detailed and warmly expressive illustrations capture the joy of sharing stories.\" \u2014New York Times Book Review.

An Amazon Best Book of the Month Named a Best Children's Book of 2017 by Parents magazine  Eugenie Clark fell in love with sharks from the first moment she saw them at the aquarium. She couldn't imagine anything more exciting than studying these graceful creatures.

Emma really enjoys swimming in the bathtub, but she knows exactly when she's been underwater long enough and needs to come up for air.  Tim loved the rabbit stuffed animal his grandmother gave him so much that he asked for another, and another, and now Tim isn't quite sure where his favorite stuffed rabbit is\u2014and there's no room for him in the bed!  In Dagmar Geisler's  I Want More\u2014When To Know When I've Had Enough , readers will meet a number of children with interests similar to their own who learn to recognize when they've had enough or when they've had too much\u2014when they've eaten too much of their favorite snack, collected too many of their favorite toys, or sat in front of the television for too long. Then, they can rank their favorite activities, toys, and foods using a scale of  Too little!   to  Enough already! , featured at the end of the book.  I Want More  gives parents, grandparents, and caregivers the opportunity to speak with children about setting limits, allowing them to develop their own internal feeling for when something is no longer beneficial, fun, or healthy.

                "A celebration of the extraordinary life of Ezra Jack Keats, creator of  The Snowy Day .  The story of  The Snowy Day  begins more than one hundred years ago, when Ezra Jack Keats was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. The family were struggling Polish immigrants, and despite Keats's obvious talent, his father worried that Ezra's dream of being an artist was an unrealistic one. But Ezra was determined. By high school he was winning prizes and scholarships. Later, jobs followed with the WPA and Marvel comics. But it was many years before Keats's greatest dream was realized and he had the opportunity to write and illustrate his own book.    For more than two decades, Ezra had kept pinned to his wall a series of photographs of an adorable African American child. In Keats's hands, the boy morphed into Peter, a boy in a red snowsuit, out enjoying the pristine snow; the book became  The Snowy Day , winner of the Caldecott Medal, the first mainstream book to feature an African American child. It was also the first of many books featuring Peter and the children of his \u2014 and Keats's \u2014 neighborhood.    Andrea Davis Pinkney's lyrical narrative tells the inspiring story of a boy who pursued a dream, and who, in turn, inspired generations of other dreamers.  From the Hardcover edition. "

Growing up in a house full of brothers and sisters, persistence and a passion for problem solving became the cornerstone for a career as an engineer and his work with NASA.

New York City in the 1860s was a mess: crowded, disgusting, filled with garbage. You see, way back in 1860, there were no subways, just cobblestone streets. That is, until Alfred Ely Beach had the idea for a fan-powered train that would travel underground. On February 26, 1870, after fifty-eight days of drilling and painting and plastering, Beach unveiled his masterpiece\u2014and throngs of visitors took turns swooshing down the track.      The Secret Subway  will wow readers, just as Beach's underground train wowed riders over a century ago. A New York Public Library Best Book for Kids, 2016. "

But when he shows his works, the professors, the critics, and the collectors all dismiss him: \"Too flat!\" \"Too much paint!\" \"These are rough and unfinished!\" Even his own pet parrot, Bisou, can't be brought to say, \"Cezanne is a great painter!\" And who can blame them? Cezanne doesn't care about tradition, and he doesn't follow the rules. He's painting in a way no one else has done before, creating something completely new\u2014and he's destined to change the world of art forever.  Cezanne's Parrot  is a spirited celebration of creativity, determination, and perseverance\u2014and the artist who would become known as the father of modern art. "

Now Sophie tells her inspiring story in this picture book that celebrates women in science, bugs of all kinds, and the importance of staying true to yourself.    Sophia Spencer has loved bugs ever since a butterfly landed on her shoulder\u2014and wouldn't leave!\u2014at a butterfly conservancy when she was only two-and-a-half years old. In preschool and kindergarten, Sophia was thrilled to share what she knew about grasshoppers (her very favorite insects), as well as ants and fireflies... but by first grade, not everyone shared her enthusiasm. Some students bullied her, and Sophia stopped talking about bugs altogether. When Sophia's mother wrote to an entomological society looking for a bug scientist to be a pen pal for her daughter, she and Sophie were overwhelmed by the enthusiastic response\u2014letters, photos, and videos came flooding in. Using the hashtag BugsR4Girls, scientists tweeted hundreds of times to tell Sophia to keep up her interest in bugs\u2014and it worked! Sophia has since appeared on Good Morning America, The Today Show, and NPR, and she continues to share her love of bugs with others. "

Driven to protect and take care of her hive, she cleans the nursery and feeds the larvae and the queen. But is she strong enough to fly? Not yet!  Apis builds wax comb to store honey, and transfers pollen from other bees into the storage. She defends the hive from invaders. And finally, she begins her new life as an adventurer.  The confining walls of the hive fall away as Apis takes to the air, finally free, in a brilliant double-gatefold illustration where the clear blue sky is full of promise\u2014 and the wings of dozens of honeybees, heading out in search of nectar to bring back to the hive.  Eric Rohmann's exquisitely detailed illustrations bring the great outdoors into your hands in this poetically written tribute to the hardworking honeybee. Award-winning author Candace Fleming describes the life cycle of the honeybee in accessible, beautiful language. Similar in form and concept to the Sibert and Orbis Pictus award book  Giant Squid, Honeybee  also features a stunning gatefold and an essay on the plight of honeybees.  A Junior Library Guild Selection!. "

By simply, clearly and positively explaining the social differences associated with Asperger's Syndrome, or Autism Spectrum Disorder, in young girls, this book will help Aspie Girls aged 5 years and over to understand their diagnosis, recognise their unique strengths and celebrate their differences, and find ways of coping with difficulties. This positive and celebratory book also contains helpful discussion points for parents and professionals to explore further with the girls in their care. "

She is small at roughly 6 pounds and approximately 20 inches tall; but at 24 years old, she is the \"penguin in charge\" of the penguin exhibit at New Orleans's Audubon Aquarium of the Americas. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina hits, devastating the city and surrounding areas with its catastrophic winds and flooding. The aquarium is severely damaged. With no electricity or relief in sight, the temperature in the aquarium reaches dangerously high degrees, putting the penguins in peril. Patience, and the 18 other penguins, along with some of the other zoo animals, must leave their home and their favorite human, Tom, the penguin keeper. Tom drives his penguins to Baton Rouge where an airplane transfers them to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. Here the penguins will recuperate and live until they can return home to New Orleans. After nine long months away from Tom and their home, the aquarium is finally restored. And Patience, who has been patient, and her penguins return to New Orleans to a cheering homecoming. "

As it was the first visit ever by reigning British royalty, it was a chance for America to build a stronger relationship with the British, especially in those challenging times. On the domestic side, many people didn't have jobs, housing, or food. Internationally, Adolf Hitler, Germany's leader, was threatening the countries around him and war loomed on the horizon. But First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saw the visit as an opportunity for America to set aside its cares for a while and extend a warm welcome and hand of friendship to the royal guests. As part of the festivities, Eleanor hosts an all-American picnic that includes hot dogs, a menu item that shocks some people. "

Dogs come in such a variety of shapes, sizes, and breeds, that it is hard to believe that they all have a common ancestor\u2014the wolf! Hudson Talbott takes readers on a fascinating journey through history to see how wolves' relationships with humans sparked their development into the dogs we know and love today.     Striking paintings, from an adorable wolf pup to a wide range of modern-day dog breeds, illustrate this insightful story of teamwork and friendship. Through the eyes of a prehistoric boy and a lone wolf pup, we see how the bond between our ancestors and these wild animals may have developed. Starting as enemies competing for food, the wolf and the boy realize that they'll eat better and be safer if they team up. Over time, others catch on, and as many of the wolves become more domesticated, the humans breed them for skills like hunting, herding, pulling, and rescuing. And today, there are more breeds of dog than of any other animal, all thanks to this relationship that started so long ago.  From the Hardcover edition. "
