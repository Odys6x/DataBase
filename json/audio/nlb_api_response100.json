                "*INCLUDES 15 VIDEO CHAPTER LESSONS! David Molnar was never supposed to be a professional photographer. Until the fateful day he almost died from a head on collision. While learning to walk again, photography became his escape and a form of therapy. But he found that turning pro in photography wasn't clear. There is no bar exam for photography. He wished he had a mentor to show him the way. He struggled for a decade using trial and error before finding eventual success. His work has now been seen by hundreds of millions of people in publications likeThe New York Times, People Magazine, USA Today, on billboards, on album covers and on millions of Pepsi and Mountain Dew cans.  This book is the guide he wished he'd had 20 years ago. David promised himself that if he ever figured out photography, he would become the mentor for others that he never had. So he created this book which describes his easy 5 step path that anyone can use to become a great photographer, and turn pro if they want. Whether you want to pursue photography for passion or for profit this book is for you!. "

                "\"A brutally real and unrelentingly raw memoir.\"\u2014 Kirkus  (starred review)  War photographer Lynsey Addario\u2019s memoir  It\u2019s What I Do  is the story of how the relentless pursuit of truth, in virtually every major theater of war in the twenty-first century, has shaped her life. What she does, with clarity, beauty, and candor, is to document, often in their most extreme moments, the complex lives of others. It\u2019s her work, but it\u2019s much more than that: it\u2019s her singular calling.  Lynsey Addario was just finding her way as a young photographer when September 11 changed the world. One of the few photojournalists with experience in Afghanistan, she gets the call to return and cover the American invasion. She makes a decision she would often find herself making\u2014not to stay home, not to lead a quiet or predictable life, but to set out across the world, face the chaos of crisis, and make a name for herself.  Addario finds a way to travel with a purpose. She photographs the Afghan people before and after the Taliban reign, the civilian casualties and misunderstood insurgents of the Iraq War, as well as the burned villages and countless dead in Darfur. She exposes a culture of violence against women in the Congo and tells the riveting story of her headline-making kidnapping by pro-Qaddafi forces in the Libyan civil war.  Addario takes bravery for granted but she is not fearless. She uses her fear and it creates empathy; it is that feeling, that empathy, that is essential to her work. We see this clearly on display as she interviews rape victims in the Congo, or photographs a fallen soldier with whom she had been embedded in Iraq, or documents the tragic lives of starving Somali children. Lynsey takes us there and we begin to understand how getting to the hard truth trumps fear.  As a woman photojournalist determined to be taken as seriously as her male peers, Addario fights her way into a boys\u2019 club of a profession. Rather than choose between her personal life and her career, Addario learns to strike a necessary balance. In the man who will become her husband, she finds at last a real love to complement her work, not take away from it, and as a new mother, she gains an all the more intensely personal understanding of the fragility of life.  Watching uprisings unfold and people fight to the death for their freedom, Addario understands she is documenting not only news but also the fate of society.  It\u2019s What I Do  is more than just a snapshot of life on the front lines; it is witness to the human cost of war. "

You ask yourself what the story is that you want to tell, and let the rest unfold: Click.\"\u2014from the introduction  Joe Greer never imagined he would become a photographer.   Raised in Florida by an aunt and uncle after his mother's death when he was four, Joe had a seemingly normal childhood, spending summers at church camp and dreaming of going to college. But nearly fifteen years later, the ground shifted beneath his feet when he discovered a family secret that would impact the rest of his life.  Trying to make sense of that revelation and what it meant for his future, Greer set his sights on becoming a pastor at Spokane's Moody Bible Institute. There, he discovered Instagram\u2014and a passion for photography. His pictures of the lush, wild beauty of the Pacific Northwest landscape attracted a large following that has grown to more than three quarters of a millions fans and continues to expand.   The Lay of the Land is Joe's story. In this stunning compendium, he reflects on the trauma of his early life and what photography has taught him: how to find his light; how to slow down; how to appreciate the world around him, a reverence for the nature world that that both nurtures and amplifies his creativity and faith; how to love\u2014his photography led him to his wife, Madison\u2014and how to heal. For Joe, photography has been a way to find purpose, better understand his faith, and express himself. Though he began with landscapes, meeting his wife sparked a new love of portraiture, and he turned to making photos of street scenes that explored his complicated feelings about family.   A love letter to the natural world, to faith, and to finding your calling in the most unexpected places, The Lay of the Land is a window into the beautiful mind and heart of one of the internet's favorite photographers. Moving and inspiring, it is a creative and spiritual journey that offers lessons on life and living. As Greer reminds us all, whatever it is you want, it's up to you to make the moment (and the photograph). "

This powerful essay collection is a natural extension of the #MeToo movement, revealing the interior experience of women after they've inevitably been underestimated or hurt\u2014the epiphany that the world is different than they thought it to be\u2014and how they've used this knowledge to make change.   In  My Moment , Gloria Steinem tells the story of how a meeting with writer Terry Southern drew blood. Carol Burnett shares how CBS discouraged her from pursuing  The Carol Burnett Show , because comedy variety shows were \"a man's game.\" Joanna Gaines reveals how coming to New York City as a young woman helped her embrace her Korean heritage after enduring racist bullying as a child. Author Maggie Smith details a career crossroads when her boss declined her request to work from home after the birth of her daughter, leading her to quit and never look back.   Over and over again, when told \"no\" these women said \"yes\" to themselves. This hugely inspiring, beautiful book will move people of all ages and make them feel less alone. More than the sum of its parts,  My Moment  is also a handbook for young women (or any woman) making their way through the world. "

Considered \"the world's most popular cult novelist\" ( The Guardian ), Haruki Murakami has written books that have galvanized millions around the world. Many of his fans know about his 10,000-vinyl-record collection, and his obsession with running, but few have heard about a more intimate, and perhaps more unique, passion: his T-shirt-collecting habit.   In  Murakami T,  the famously reclusive novelist shows us his T-shirts\u2014including gems from the  Springsteen on Broadway  show in NYC, to the Beach Boys concert in Honolulu, to the shirt that inspired the beloved short story \u201cTony Takitani.\u201d Accompanied by short, frank essays that have been translated into English for the first time, these photographs reveal much about Murakami's multifaceted and wonderfully eccentric persona.   *Includes a downloadable PDF of images from the book.

Carolyn Burke reveals Miller as a multifaceted woman: both model and photographer, muse and reporter, sexual adventurer and mother, and, in later years, gourmet cook\u2014the last of the many dramatic transformations she underwent during her lifetime. A sleek blond bombshell, Miller was part of a glamorous circle in New York and Paris in the 1920s and 1930s as a leading  Vogue  model, close to Edward Steichen, Charlie Chaplin, Jean Cocteau, and Pablo Picasso. Then, during World War II, she became a war correspondent\u2014one of the first women to do so\u2014shooting harrowing images of a devastated Europe, entering Dachau with the Allied troops, posing in Hitler\u2019s bathtub.  Burke examines Miller\u2019s troubled personal life, from the unsettling photo sessions during which Miller, both as a child and as a young woman, posed nude for her father, to her crucial affair with artist-photographer Man Ray, to her unconventional marriages. And through Miller\u2019s body of work, Burke explores the photographer\u2019s journey from object to subject; her eye for form, pattern, and light; and the powerful emotion behind each of her images.  A lush story of art and beauty, sex and power, Modernism and Surrealism, independence and collaboration,  Lee Miller: A Life  is an astute study of a fascinating, yet enigmatic, cultural figure.   This program includes a downloadable PDF that contains Lee Miller\u2019s recipes for a dinner party, \u00a0as assembled by Carolyn Burke. "

In the book Cross Country, Gates documents this epic experience from South Carolina to San Francisco, sharing  first-person essays and interviews  from the ordinary and extraordinary people and places he saw along the way. While Gates delivers unparalleled insight into the extreme athletic and mental challenge of this transcontinental run, running is not the core focus of Cross Country\u2014it is a story of the remarkable people across the United States who we would otherwise never meet. \u2022 A travelogue that follows along Rickey Gates's run across the country, and the individuals who live in it \u2022 From South Carolina to San Francisco, the five-month-long run covers 3,700 miles of hiking trails, rivers, and roads.   Gates slept in the rain, carried meager possessions on his back, ran through the night, endured mental and physical challenges, and survived on a staple of gas station hot dogs and Pop Tarts.    Delivering a patchwork portrait of America, Gates's captivating story captures the spirit of our country\u2014that grit, determination, and compassion are qualities that can unite us all. "

Arnade's raw, deeply reported accounts cut through today's clickbait media headlines and indict the elitists who misunderstood poverty and addiction in America for decades.After abandoning his Wall Street career, Arnade decided to document poverty and addiction in the Bronx. He began interviewing, photographing, and becoming close friends with homeless addicts, and spent hours in drug dens and McDonald's. Then he started driving across America to see how the rest of the country compared. He found the same types of stories everywhere, across lines of race, ethnicity, religion, and geography. The people he got to know, from Alabama and California to Maine and Nevada, gave Arnade a new respect for the dignity and resilience of what he calls America's Back Row\u2014those who lack the credentials and advantages of the so-called meritocratic upper class. The strivers in the Front Row, with their advanced degrees and upward mobility, see the Back Row's values as worthless. They scorn anyone who stays in a dying town or city as foolish, and mock anyone who clings to religion or tradition as na\u00efve.As Takeesha, a woman in the Bronx, told Arnade, she wants to be seen she sees herself: \"a prostitute, a mother of six, and a child of God.\" This book is his attempt to help the rest of us truly see, hear, and respect millions of people who've been left behind.

                "The first definitive biography of Weegee the Famous\u2014photographer, psychic, fiend\u2014from Christoper Bonanos, author of Instant: The Story of Polaroid.Arthur Fellig's ability to arrive at a crime scene just as the cops did was so uncanny that he renamed himself \"Weegee,\" claiming that he functioned as a human Ouija board. Weegee documented better than any other photographer the crime, grit, and complex humanity of midcentury New York City. In Flash, we get a portrait not only of the man (both flawed and deeply talented, with generous appetites for publicity, women, and hot pastrami) but also of the fascinating time and place that he occupied.From self-taught immigrant kid to newshound to art-world darling to latter-day caricature\u2014moving from the dangerous streets of New York City to the celebrity culture of Los Angeles and then to Europe for a quixotic late phase of experimental photography and filmmaking\u2014Weegee lived a life just as worthy of documentation as the scenes he captured. With Flash, we have an unprecedented and ultimately moving view of the man now regarded as an innovator and a pioneer, an artist as well as a newsman, whose photographs are among most powerful images of urban existence ever made.

                "In honor of the one hundredth anniversary of George H. W. Bush\u2019s birth, this visually stunning chronicle features never-before-published photos and memories celebrating the forty-first president\u2019s vision of leadership as service to country\u2014curated by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning biographer Jon Meacham.  Lavishly illustrated,  The Call to Serve  is an intimate, illuminating portrait of the forty-first president, a man who was so much more than just his politics. In words and images\u2014many found in a lifetime of scrapbooks kept by Barbara Pierce Bush\u2014Jon Meacham brings George H. W. Bush vividly to life. From the values of integrity, empathy, and grace that Bush learned in childhood to his leadership at the highest levels in tumultuous times, the forty-first president embodied an ideal of service that warrants attention in our own divided time. Bush pursued a life of service to America through his heroic combat experience in the Pacific during World War II, his political rise in Texas, his serving as U.S. ambassador to the UN, his time as envoy to China and as director of the CIA, his tenure as Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice president, and his election as the forty-first president of the United States. Set against the background of America during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, this book commemorates the legacy of a man who was far from perfect\u2014he could be cutthroat on the campaign trail\u2014but whose ambition was not an end unto itself. Bush\u2019s drive to succeed was, rather, a means to put the values of balance, patriotism, and respect for others into action in the political arena. Toward the end of Bush\u2019s life, the forty-fourth president, Barack Obama, said that Bush put the country first \u201cboth before he was president, while he was president, and ever since.\u201d Featuring more than 450 photographs, Meacham\u2019s introduction and commentary throughout, and narration drawn from his biography of George H. W. Bush,  Destiny and Power,  this is an essential tribute to a uniquely American life.  * This audiobook edition includes a downloadable PDF of photos from the book. "
