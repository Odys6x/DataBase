                "Ooh la la! Gwen ends up on a Parisian scavenger hunt-with a cute French ami-in this novel from the author of Lost in London. Gwen Russell is thrilled to hear she will be heading to Paris with her family. Even though the main reason for the trip is to see her three older brothers play lacrosse, Gwen and her Mom have plans to tour the city when they can. As soon as they land, Gwen is swept up in the city she has always wanted to see, and even meets a tres cute boy named Henri. If that wasn't enough excitement, Gwen finds out that her all-time favorite band is playing a one-night only concert in Paris-and there are tickets available to the sold-old show for three lucky people. The catch? Fans who want a golden ticket have to work for it via a scavenger hunt around the City of Light. Through cryptic clues blasted out every day through a special website, Gwen and her new friends find themselves in a race against time-and against other die-hard fans-as they scramble to landmarks throughout Paris. And it turns out the concert tickets might not even be the biggest prize . . . "

That very night in Max's room a forest grew  and grew\u2014  Mary Pols of Time magazine wrote that \"what makes Sendak's book so compelling is its grounding effect: Max has a tantrum and in a flight of fancy visits his wild side, but he is pulled back by a belief in parental love to a supper 'still hot.'\" Generations have shared this beautiful book, and readers of all ages will want to return to it again and again.

' Unputdownable storytelling. I loved it.' - Hilary McKay, Costa Award-winning author of  The Skylark's War    In 1946, Rosa Sweetman, a young Kindertransport girl, is longing for her family to claim her. The war in Europe is over and she is the only child left at Westwood, a rambling country estate in the north of England, where she'd taken refuge seven years earlier.  The arrival of a friend of the family, Yara Fielding, starts an adventure that will take Rosa deep into the lush beauty of the Amazon rainforest in search of jaguars, ancient giant sloths and somewhere to belong. What she finds is Yara's lively, welcoming family on the banks of the river and, together, they face a danger greater than she could ever have imagined.  Featuring places and characters known and loved by fans of  Journey to the River Sea  (including, among others, Maia, Finn, Miss Minton and Clovis) this spectacular new chapter in the story tells of the next generation and the growing threats to the Amazon rainforest that continue to this day.

For centuries, the magnificent Throne of Felipe has stood with two empty spaces beside its famous silver arrow-spaces where the silver castle and lion should have been. And now, with the recent discovery of the silver castle within a secret vault in Seville, Spain, the hunt is on for the third silver icon. With all three pieces in the place, the throne will be enormously valuable-making it a hot item on VILE's radar. Now it's up to Carmen and crew to find the silver lion before VILE does, and protect the throne from winding up in the wrong hands. "

Born in India and sent to school in England, she is, at first, treated like a princess by the teacher, Miss Minchin. But when it is evident that Sara is not the possessor of a princess's fortune, she is despatched to live in the attic and become a servant. It is the remarkable way which Sara copes\u00a0- imagining things are not as bad as they seem\u00a0- which has made her a role model for many young girls, who also hope to experience her happy ending.

(Lyman) Frank Baum was born on May 15, 1856 in Chittenango, NY. In 1882, with his father's financial help, he took his five-act Irish melodrama, The Maid of Arran, to New York City, where it was successful. At his mother-in-law's suggestion, he published his first book Mother Goose in Prose in 1897, and in 1899, his Father Goose: His Book, became the best-selling picture book. However, Baum is best known for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which became influential to the American musical theatres. He died in 1919. "

The Tale of Troy was so important to the ancient Greeks that its author, Homer, became a kind of hero. Long after his death artists, thinkers and ordinary people still look to his tale for inspiration. This exciting version of the famous story is retold especially for eight- to thirteen-year-olds. "

                "Peter Pan, the book based on J. M. Barrie's famous play, is filled with unforgettable characters: Peter Pan, the boy who would not grow up; the fairy, Tinker Bell; the evil pirate, Captain Hook; and the three children, Wendy, John, and Michael, who fly off with Peter Pan to Neverland, where they meet Indians and pirates and a crocodile that ticks.    Born in Scotland in 1860, J. M. Barrie started writing at an early age. He worked as a freelancer in the mid-1880's and his first published book was Better Dead. He was also a playwright and produced famous plays like Walker, London and The Little Minister, which was originally a novel he published in 1891. He married actress Mary Ansell in 1894. However, Peter Pan also known as 'The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up,' proved to be most successful. During World War I, he wrote several plays for the London Stage and also raised funds for different charities. After a range of well-written novels and plays, Barrie died on June 19, 1937 in London, England.    Vanessa Maroney has a wonderful gift for English dialects and has narrated many of our children's titles. She is a native of the British Isles and graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, receiving the RADA silver medal, Sir Emile Littler and Caryl Brahms awards. An accomplished actress, she has recorded over 150 books. "

Black Beauty  is the autobiography of a courageous horse who was often badly mistreated. When first published, it was an immediate success. Anna Sewell died knowing that her book had indeed encouraged people to treat animals less cruelly.    Anna Sewell was born in Yarmouth, England in 1820. When she was fourteen she sprained her ankle running down a steep road. She was never able to walk upright again, but she could still ride the horses she loved so much. A friend said that Anna didn't use the reins, but would guide the horses by talking to them. When she was fifty, Anna was confined to bed and it was while she was bed-ridden that she wrote  Black Beauty  \"to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.\" She died in 1878 at the age of fifty- eight, one year after  Black Beauty , her only book, was published.    Kate Redding is an accomplished actress and narrator, having narrated hundreds of books. In this wonderful narration she lets us know that  Black Beauty  is one of her favorite children's stories. "

We meet Billy Bones, Blind Pew, Black Dog and, of course, the charming buccaneer Long John Silver. The action and adventure never falter, and the spell of this enduring story is sustained until the very last word.  Music:  Smetana, German, Bantock, Borodin. "
