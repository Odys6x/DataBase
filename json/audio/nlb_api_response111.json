                "From award-winning author Candace Fleming, comes the powerful and fascinating story of the brave and dedicated young women who helped turn the tides of World War II for the Allies, with their hard work and determination at Bletchley Park.     \"You are to report to Station X at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, in four days time....That is all you need to know.\" This was the terse telegram hundreds of young women throughout the British Isles received in the spring of 1941, as World War II raged. As they arrived at Station X, a sprawling mansion in a state of disrepair surrounded by Spartan-looking huts with little chimneys coughing out thick smoke-these young people had no idea what kind of work they were stepping into. Who had recommended them? Why had they been chosen? Most would never learn all the answers to these questions.  Bletchley Park was a well-kept secret during World War II, operating under the code name Station X. The critical work of code-cracking Nazi missives that went on behind its closed doors could determine a victory or loss against Hitler's army. Amidst the brilliant cryptographers, flamboyant debutantes, and absent-minded professors working there, it was teenaged girls who kept Station X running. Some could do advanced math, while others spoke a second language. They ran the unwieldy bombe machines, made sense of wireless sound waves, and sorted the decoded messages. They were expected to excel in their fields and most importantly: know how to keep a secret.  Candace Fleming is the award-winning and highly acclaimed author of  Crash from Outer Space ,  The Curse of the Mummy , and many other nonfiction books for young readers. With her canny and compelling narrative voice she makes history come alive. Thick with tension and suspense, this is an extraordinary and relatively unknown story of World War II that will fascinate listeners who will be thrilled to see young people playing such an important role in the wartime effort.

The only clue to her identity is a series of tiny numbers etched into her dental implants. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a married man is arrested for the murder of his mistress. The police are adamant that he is her killer. However, forensic evidence tells a different story altogether. The Bali bombing investigation was essentially a giant murder case: one with 202 victims and three crime scenes. But outstanding investigative work by forensic scientists helped to identify the bombers and bring them to trial. This casebook of 16 fascinating true stories from Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Indonesia by award-winning Australian true crime writer Liz Porter shows how forensic science is used to catch killers, solve mysteries and exonerate falsely accused suspects. \u00a9 2018 by Liz Porter.

Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven audiobook offers clear, concrete language to introduce the concept of BODY LIBERATION. This audiobook serves to celebrate the uniqueness of your body and all bodies, and addresses the unfair rules and ideas that currently exist about bodies. It ends with motivational action points for making the world more fair for all! While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. "

                "We all want our students to feel safe, collaborate well with others, feel ownership for their learning, and be joyfully engaged in their work. Nevertheless, many teachers end up using language patterns that undermine these goals. Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?    We want students to take responsibility for their learning, yet we use language that implies teacher ownership.   We want to build positive relationships with students, yet we use sarcasm when we get frustrated.   We want students to think learning is fun, yet we sometimes make comments that suggest the opposite.   We want students to exhibit good behavior because it's the right thing to do, yet we rely on threats and bribes, which implies students don't naturally want to be good.  What teachers say to students - when they praise or discipline, give directions or ask questions, and introduce concepts or share stories - affects student learning and behavior. A slight change in intonation can also dramatically change how language feels for students. In  What We Say and How We Say It Matter , Mike Anderson digs into the nuances of language in the classroom. This audiobook's many examples will help teachers examine their language habits and intentionally improve their classroom practice so their language matches and supports their goals. Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont.  \u00a92019 ASCD \u00a7. "

Etiquette, Sara Jane says, is the glue that holds society together. Humans are social creatures, after all\u2014we need connection to survive. But with global cultures in flux and the post-pandemic digital age, shadow epidemics of anxiety and loneliness are on the rise. Plus, the old rules of \"decorum\" don't match the times.  Amidst all this withdrawal and change, social growth can feel out of reach. How do we leave the comfort of our homes, step away from our screens, and interact face to face? How do we create genuine bonds with people we've just met, and how do we maintain those ties throughout our lives? Even the most resilient social butterflies among us face sticky situations\u2014from accidentally-sent invites to unruly work and family encounters\u2014any advice would help.  In her signature cheeky yet pragmatic style, Sara Jane Ho imparts a lifetime's worth of lessons, pro-tips, and FAQs on social and digital etiquette across the five main microcultures in our lives: Friendship & Social Life, Work, Dating & Relationships, Family, and Food & Travel. From jumping everyday hurdles to discerning unspoken, cross-cultural cues,  Mind Your Manners  helps us feel the joy and transformation of social fluency\u2014that deep comfort that comes from connection, inclusion, and presenting our best self in any situation.

In the years since, she kept hearing questions from listeners on how to approach a second pregnancy when the first has not gone as planned. While  The Unexpected  is an audiobook that Oster hopes no one needs, the reality is that 50 percent of pregnancies include complications, a fact we don\u2019t talk about. Preeclampsia, miscarriage, hyperemesis gravidarum, preterm birth, postpartum depression: these are lonely experiences, and that isolation makes treatment harder to access\u2014and crucial research and policy change less likely to happen.  The Unexpected  lays out the data on recurrence and treatments shown to lower or mitigate risk for these conditions in subsequent pregnancies. It also provides listeners road maps to facilitate productive conversations with their providers, with insights from lauded maternal fetal medicine specialist Dr. Nathan Fox. By bridging the knowledge gap and making space for difficult conversations,  The Unexpected  promises to make the hardest parts of pregnancy a little bit less so.  *Includes a downloadable PDF of graphs and tables from the book.

Now, in this updated and expanded series compiled from The American Patriot's Almanac, Bennett and Cribb's masterful grasp of our history offers 150 more great Americans.   Our history is a heritage we Americans all share. It ties us together, like a common language or currency.

                "There's an apocryphal story that Alexander the Great once captured a notorious pirate named Diomedes. The great conqueror decided to interview the doomed pirate, asking him what he thought gave him the right to seize the property of other people. The pirate responded by asking the emperor what he thought gave him the right to take property that doesn't belong to him, including entire countries. The story goes that Alexander thought the pirate very clever, granting him freedom instead of execution. Other than scale, what is the difference between a pirate and the vast armies of an emperor? Or between a pirate and the great navy of a queen? Were the men who famously traversed the Atlantic actually the heroic explorers we imagined them to be\u2014or were they... pirates? During the early years of what would be known as the Age of Sail, these explorers included Sirs Francis Drake, John Hawkins, and Walter Ralegh. In  The Real History of Pirates , you'll find yourself looking at world history from a new point of view, realizing that much of what you've learned before could\u2014and possibly should\u2014be viewed through a more appropriate post-imperialistic filter. Your course professor, Manushag N. Powell, an award-winning Professor of English at Purdue University, will expose you to new ways of thinking about global interactions from the West Indies to the Red Sea, from the North Atlantic to Indonesia. You'll learn what causes piracy, why it still flourishes today, why some pirates even had the backing of a well-established government, and why women sometimes wielded the real power behind the scenes in an enterprise conducted almost exclusively by men.

                "Psychology in the 21st century is not the seemingly static clinical field that you may have learned about in high school. Now there's a substantial focus on \"mindset\" and the malleable nature of our experiences. When we understand how our mindset works, we can influence our behavior. There is also a greater emphasis on how the principles of psychology can help you to improve your everyday life, including how understanding your perceptions can help you to better understand the world. Human beings are endlessly fascinating. Our social organization, our perceptions of the world, our emotional range, and our inner thoughts all define what it means to be human. The field of psychology has always been the scientific study of mental processes and behavior, helping us to understand ourselves and the world around us. How do we think, feel, and remember? Why do we act the way we do? And, most important, is there any way we can train our minds to improve our lives? What's new in the field of psychology is that many answers to these questions are beginning to be well understood. From the days of Freud and Skinner to the modern science of fMRIs and genetics,  Introduction to Psychology  is a grand introduction to one of the most captivating fields of inquiry\u2014where the subject is you, and everyone around you. Taught by Professor Catherine A. Sanderson of Amherst College, these 36 insightful lessons not only give you a panoramic grounding in the history, methods, and fundamental findings of psychology, but they also introduce you to the most up-to-date 21st-century research and discoveries\u2014including strategies to increase your happiness and to improve how to live your life. When you complete  Introduction to Psychology , you will come away with a new way of looking at the human experience. You will have gained insights to help you better understand yourself. And your new wealth of strategies will help you to think more clearly, be more courageous, strengthen relationships, and generally experience greater psychological and physical well-being. "

A soldier in the Spanish army, she traveled to Peru and Chile, became a gambler, and even mistakenly killed her own brother in a duel. During her lifetime she emerged as the adored folkloric hero of the Spanish-speaking world. This delightful translation of Catalina's own work introduces a new audience to her audacious escapades. "

                "It likely comes as no surprise that, as adults, we learn differently than we did when we were children. Our brains are full of experiences and information we have acquired over time, and these resources are exactly what we apply to any new learning event, whether it's a new job or hobby, or simply a novel experience or conversation we need to navigate. And the nature of how we learn shapes the way we communicate\u2014both how we give and how we receive information in our everyday lives. The field of neuroandragogy is the study of how adults learn and what role the brain plays in that process. By digging into this unique field and its discoveries, you can better understand how your own mind works and develop strategies based on this knowledge to communicate successfully in various situations and environments. As you will see, communicating with others is not just about clarity. Useful and rewarding communication is also about understanding how to grab someone's attention and how to ensure that the information that you share can be retained and used. Knowing how the adult mind works can help you to optimize your approach in getting the results you want from your communications. In  The Brain-Based Guide to Communicating Better , Professor Allison Friederichs will walk you through six lessons that can help you better know your own mind, and thus understand and transform your own methods of communication. You will learn how your brain acquires, processes, and retains information. You can then take that knowledge and apply it whenever you need to convey something to others, with the best possible results. While you may not have any control over how other people communicate, developing your own methods of connection and conversation can have a positive impact on both your personal and professional life. Along the way, Professor Friederichs encourages you to keep a communication journal that can help you learn and process the invaluable information she shares. Keeping a journal allows you to have a continual resource for both her lessons and your own observations. "

                "The Zodiac Killer. The Son of Sam. The Lindbergh kidnapping. Over the past century, certain crimes have captured the imagination of the public, dominating the front pages of newspapers and inspiring armchair investigators for generations. At the heart of these \"crimes of the century\" is often a burning question: Who did it? Or, if the culprit is known, what was the motivation? Delve into some of the most infamous, ghastly, and mysterious crimes of the last hundred-odd years in  Crimes of the Century: A Selective History of Infamy . Taught by Professor Richard B. Spence of the University of Idaho, this enthralling course gives you a dozen case studies of murders most foul. From an intriguing Irish domestic murder to a world-shaking political assassination, this course gives you an inside look at some of the most heinous and maddeningly unknowable crimes in modern history.Contemporary tabloids may have offered salacious details as the crimes were unfurling, but today we have the beauty of hindsight to analyze the crimes. While many of them remain as mysterious as when they occurred, the historian's view allows us to situate the homicides in their time and place and can give us insight into both the particulars of the era as well as something universal about human nature. Whether you are a die-hard true crime fan, or just interested in compelling stories about gruesome events,  Crimes of the Century: A Selective History of Infamy  will open your eyes to the dark side of history... and humanity.

                "From veteran award-winning investigative journalists Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman, the epic inside story of the prosecution of a president.     In  Find Me the Votes,  two years of immersive reporting by Isikoff and Klaidman has produced the most authoritative and dramatic account yet of a defeated president's conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election and how a local Georgia prosecutor\u2014a daughter of the civil rights movement\u2014decided to indict him and his allies for his desperate attempt to hold on to power. From the beginning, Fani Willis saw Donald Trump's crimes as a voting rights case, and an attempt by the former president to deprive the citizens of Georgia of the franchise, a right for which her forebears had bled.    Isikoff and Klaidman take us deep inside both the nerve center of Trump's effort to steal the election  and  the DA's team of prosecutors as they build their case against the president. Their reporting reveals new information on the plot to criminally seize voting equipment in several states; Sidney Powell's attempt to obtain preemptive pardons from Trump; and revelatory communications between the president and his co-conspirators. We see the prosecution take shape in Willis's office in the face of heinous threats of violent retaliation from Trump's supporters.     With blockbuster original reporting and exclusive access to thousands of secret documents, emails, text messages, and audio recordings,  Find Me the Votes  is investigative journalism at its finest. The authors also conducted exclusive interviews with key sources in the Trump conspiracy, as well as with the president's top targets, including Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger and the Fulton County DA's team\u2013featuring hours of interviews with Fani Willis herself. This is riveting contemporary history, and a lasting account of the prosecution of a president who tested the rule of law as no president ever had before. Isikoff and Klaidman have written a story for the ages. "

                "A powerful collection of quotations by writers, leaders, and legends on the pain of losing a pet and overcoming grief.  An animal's love is deep, uncomplicated, unconditional, and forgiving. \"Affection without ambivalence\" is how Sigmund Freud described the connection. \"No matter how awful the day, or how awful I am behaving at any given moment, George doesn't care,\" writes journalist John Dickerson. \"He finds me smoldering in my chair and dashes to my lap.\" Our lives are intricately intertwined with our pets, and together, over time, we establish rituals that are as steady as a metronome. It's no wonder the grief is crushing when they depart\u2014even those who've had time to prepare describe feeling stunned, devastated, and cracked in two.   \"We were a bit broken up over the death of our black Persian cat,\" crime novelist Raymond Chandler confessed. \"When I say a bit broken up, I am being conventional. For us it was a tragedy.\" Nobel Prize\u2013winning author V. S. Naipaul described the experience as \"calamitous,\" and writer May Sarton called it a \"volcanic eruption of woe.\" Poet Emily Dickinson was so bereft she asked for help: \"Carlo died,\" she announced in a letter to her friend Thomas Wentworth Higginson in 1866. \"Would you instruct me now?\"    The Book of Pet Love and Loss  is a collection of quotations\u2014poignant thoughts and memories discovered in letters, journals, diaries, memoirs, and other original sources\u2014from beloved cultural figures who understood this singular experience so deeply, they felt compelled to write about it. This book dignifies the profound connection we share with our animal companions, but it also provides solace as mourners document their heartache over the loss of their cats, dogs, rabbits, birds, and other animals\u2014even, in the case of Pablo Neruda, a mongoose. Their comforting and wise words are what every animal lover needs on this journey of heartbreak and healing. "

Think of the titans of astronomy and you're likely to think of names like Edwin Hubble, Albert Einstein, and Carl Sagan. And while these individuals revolutionized our understanding of the visible and invisible universe, they, too, were standing on the shoulders of other scientists and engineers without whom none of their groundbreaking ideas would have been possible.  Great Heroes and Discoveries of Astronomy  takes you around the world and across time in search of the unsung heroes who, in many ways, are just as important to the story of astronomy as Hubble, Einstein, and Sagan. Whether they stood on the shoulders of giants or themselves offered shoulders for giants to stand on, the heroes of astronomy you'll meet in these 24 lessons are a collective of the brightest and most daring minds in science. Other influential astronomers you'll meet include Annie Jump Cannon, who revolutionized the way astronomers classified the stars; Grote Reber, who designed what we recognize today as radio telescopes; Vera Rubin, who identified the first observational evidence of dark matter; and so many others. From groundbreaking new theories to serendipitous observations, from engineering the world's largest telescopes to designing bold new ways to detect gravitational waves, you'll witness the evolution of astronomical knowledge in small steps and incredible leaps. This is an incomparable window into why we've always found the stars so fascinating. And why we always will. "

                "Game theory is the study of strategic decision-making in politics, sports, diplomacy, and a host of other areas, but especially in economics.  Understanding Economics: Game Theory  introduces you to this fascinating field, which combines the fun and challenge of games with the logic of brain teasers. In 12 entertaining half-hour lessons, Professor Jay R. Corrigan of Kenyon College analyzes classics such as the prisoner's dilemma, the hawk-dove game, and the ultimatum game.Each lesson is devoted to a handful of examples, which you investigate in detail, working out the possible strategies for the different competitors and their expected payoffs. Along the way, you discover why it's hard to buy a good used car, why people confess to crimes they didn't commit, why athletes ignore the risks and use performance-enhancing drugs, and how to bid in different kinds of auctions to increase your payoff\u2014and also why you might regret winning one special type of auction.Professor Corrigan covers fundamental concepts, such as dominant strategy and Nash equilibrium. He teaches you how to diagram a game with a payoff matrix, and you practice backward induction, where you start at the game's last round and work your way back to the beginning to determine your best opening move. After taking this course, you'll know what to do the next time you bargain for a used car or get caught in the frenzy of an auction. "

How did the Old-Fashioned get its name, and why has the drink endured? What drinks were invented by Sam Ross?\u00a0What was the Pegu Club, and who bartended there? In  The Encyclopedia of Cocktails , Robert Simonson catalogues all the essential people, places, and drinks that make up our cocktail history in a refreshing take on the conventional reference book.  New York Times  cocktail and spirits writer Robert Simonson's witty and opinionated presentation of the bar world is a refreshing look at all things cocktail-related. There are more than 100 drink recipes, from the Adonis to the Zombie. Simonson also includes entries for spirits from absinthe to vodka and illuminates the origins of each. This guide isn't a strictly academic text, nor is it simply a collection of drink recipes\u2014it is\u00a0an animated, sometimes irreverent\u00a0historical journey highlighting the preeminent bars and top bartenders of record.  The Encyclopedia of Cocktails  is perfect for cocktail nerds as well as anyone interested in learning about cocktail culture. It's both a recipe book and a reference guide to keep near the bar or flip through while sipping your favorite libation. "

                "Proven bedtime solutions for parents of preschool and elementary school children \u2014 from a Yale doctor  While there are plenty of resources available to establish healthy sleeping patterns for babies and toddlers, there's very little guidance for parents who want to help their preschool and elementary school children (ages 3 - 10) sleep well. However, parents can be effective sleep coaches for their children once they know what to do.  Become Your Child's Sleep Coach  meets that need by giving you a simple plan to coach your children to be wonderful sleepers, as well as methods to deal with bed wetting, sleep walking, night terrors, and other sleep issues. The five-step plan shows you how to: 1: Prepare your child's bedroom for great sleep 2: Use the 5B Bedtime Routine every night 3: Teach your child to self-comfort as you work your way out of the room 4: Limit \"callbacks and curtain calls\" 5: Manage night and early morning wakings \"A tremendous resource that will teach you exactly how to solve your child's sleep problems.\" \u2014 From the Foreword by Meir Kryger, MD, author of  The Mystery of Sleep.

                "The Mongol Empire was the largest empire the world has ever seen, forged by conquests across Eurasia in the 13th and 14th centuries. Yet despite the unparalleled brutality of the Mongols, they played a key role in launching civilization's evolution into the modern world. In 24 half-hour lectures delivered by award-winning teacher and historian Craig Benjamin of Grand Valley State University, explore the paradox of the Mongols' extreme barbarity combined with their enlightened religious attitudes and respect for high civilization, in  The Mongol Empire . Professor Benjamin recounts the life of the most notorious Mongol of all, Chinggis Khan (also spelled Genghis Khan). He details the careers of other Great Khans, including Qubilai, Ogedai, Batu, and Hulagu, plus the saga of the last of the celebrated Mongol conquerors, Timur, also known as Tamerlane. You learn about the prehistoric origins of the Mongol nomads, the secret of Mongol military prowess, the Mongols' remote capital of Karakorum, and the many great cities and empires they sacked in a virtually unbroken string of victories stretching from Hungary to China. Even today, the Mongol conquerors are almost as shrouded in mystery as they were for the victims of their sudden raids. Yet their empire was crucial to the fate of the religions of Islam and Orthodox Christianity and to the civilization of China. Plus, the long period of stability they brought to Central Asia opened the door to dependable commercial and cultural ties between Europe and East Asia. "

                "The Montessori method is gaining popularity, and for good reason - it is eminently child-centred and is focused on laudable values such as curiosity, independence and respect. Research shows that Montessori-schooled children are calm, confident, and intelligent, and grow up to become responsible, community-minded, emotionally intelligent adults. The world needs more such people!  But Montessori has been criticized as elitist - Montessori nurseries and schools are oversubscribed and expensive, and books that show you how to apply the principles at home suggest an overhaul of your house as you set it up to suit your child's play and learning needs. But the Montessori approach has the potential to bridge the world's inequality gap - instilling values such as respect and fairness amongst peers - it should be open to all.  This audiobook makes Montessori accessible to everyone. It outlines the key principles that underpin the approach succinctly and makes applying them immediate and practical for the average time-poor working parent. It provides quick, simple and accessible ways to ensure that your child's environment is a stimulating one. It also explores the family values that Montessori instils, and how the way in which you parent and your approach to relationships can encapsulate these. Your child may not attend a Montessori school, but your family can still live by Montessori principles.  This book shows you precisely what you can do and say in the moment at the times of day you connect with your child - at school or nursery drop off, after-school time, play time, meal times, homework time, and bedtime. It also shows you that it is never too late to introduce Montessori methods to your child. You can apply the principles at any age and enjoy life-changing results.  This is the only Montessori book to recognise that most parents do not have the time and resources to overhaul their lives to fully embrace a parenting philosophy, but instead need practical, immediate guidance that is effective in the moment. Everyone can create magical Montessori moments every day - this book shows you how. The coronavirus lockdown is showing many of us how ill-equipped we are to look after and teach our own children, but it is also sparking a renewed desire to understand and learn how parenting can be more mindful, conscious, and connected. Tim Seldin is President of the Montessori Foundation and Chair of the International Montessori Council. He is one of America's most respected Montessori educators and authors, and a regular keynote speaker at conferences around the world. He is a past Director of the Institute for Advanced Montessori Studies and conducts regular webinars on Montessori education.  Lorna McGrath is the Montessori Foundation's Montessori Family Alliance Director. Lorna works directly with parents and children and is an experienced course leader and communicator. \u00a9 2021 Tim Seldon; Laura McGraff \u00a9 2021 DK Audio. "

                "From the creation of the first encyclopedia to Wikipedia, from ancient museums to modern kindergarten classes\u2014this is award winning writer Simon Winchester's brilliant and all-encompassing look at how humans acquire, retain, and pass on information and data, and how technology continues to change our lives and our minds.   With the advent of the internet, any topic we want to know about is instantly available with the touch of a smartphone button. With so much knowledge at our fingertips, what is there left for our brains to do? At a time when we seem to be stripping all value from the idea of knowing things\u2014no need for math, no need for map-reading, no need for memorization\u2014are we risking our ability to think? As we empty our minds, will we one day be incapable of thoughtfulness?  Addressing these questions, Simon Winchester explores how humans have attained, stored, and disseminated knowledge. Examining such disciplines as education, journalism, encyclopedia creation, museum curation, photography, and broadcasting, he looks at a whole range of knowledge diffusion\u2014from the cuneiform writings of Babylon to the machine-made genius of artificial intelligence, by way of Gutenberg, Google, and Wikipedia to the huge Victorian assemblage of the Mundanaeum, the collection of everything ever known, currently stored in a damp basement in northern Belgium.  Studded with strange and fascinating details, Knowing What We Know is a deep dive into learning and the human mind. Throughout this fascinating tour, Winchester forces us to ponder what rational humans are becoming. What good is all this knowledge if it leads to lack of thought? What is information without wisdom? Does Rene Descartes's Cogito, ergo sum\u2014\"I think therefore I am,\" the foundation for human knowledge widely accepted since the Enlightenment\u2014still hold?  And what will the world be like if no one in it is wise?  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Robert Olen Butler, author of Perfume River, A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain, and A Small Hotel, teaches graduate fiction at Florida State University-his version of literary boot camp. In From Where You Dream, Butler reimagines the process of writing as emotional rather than intellectual and tells writers how to achieve the dream space necessary for composing honest, inspired fiction. Proposing that fiction is the exploration of the human condition with yearning as its compass, Butler reinterprets the traditional tools of the craft using the dynamics of desire. Offering a direct view into the mind and craft of a literary master, From Where You Dream is an invaluable tool for the novice and experienced writer alike. \"Incisive and provocative, Butler's tutorials are a must for anyone even thinking about writing fiction, and readers, too, will benefit from his passionate exhortations.\" -Booklist.

                "Explore the origins of some of the automotive world's most intriguing stories, mysteries, myths, rumors, and legends.    Fantastic stories have swirled around the automobile since the first car appeared over 100 years ago.  History's Greatest Automotive Mysteries, Myths, and Rumors Revealed  compiles a juicy selection  covering subjects from racing to automakers, crime to pop culture, and historical to modern day.    Did you know that after  James Dean's death behind the wheel of his Porsche 550 Spyder , parts of the car were sold off, and said parts then cursed their new owners? Or did they?    Did you know  Bonnie and Clyde stole Ford V-8s  almost exclusively as getaway cars because they were the fastest cars of their day? Or that Clyde Barrow wrote Henry Ford a \"thank-you\" note for building the cars that made escaping his bank heists so successful?    NASCAR has been the source of countless myths and legends. Did you know, for example, that a monkey by the name of Jocko Flocko once won a Grand National race? (Hall of Fame driver Tim Flock helped.) Or that one of the most famous stock cars in  NASCAR lore \u2014a Chevelle built by legendary rules-bender Smokey Yunick\u2014never actually turned a lap on a racetrack?    Did you ever hear the one about the  1964 Impala that flew into a cliff \u2014at 350 miles per hour\u2014in the Arizona desert, thereby winning the inaugural Darwin Award? How about the  Ford Pinto that flew like a bird ? Or the 68-horsepower  Hyundai Excel that maxed out at 115 miles per hour  while speeding Rodney King to a rendezvous that would eventually lead to the L.A. Riots?    What was the  first car to break the sound barrier ? Who won the  first Indy 500 ? What kind of car was dancer Isadora Duncan in when she was killed? What car performed the  most spectacular stunt  in the James Bond movie oeuvre?    In all of these cases, the answers may not be what you think.    These are just a few of the automotive world's crazy stories, mysteries, myths, and legends.  Listen and be amazed!. "

The Herald Snow. Every language has its own words for the magical, mesmerising flakes that fall from the sky. In this exquisite exploration, writer and Arctic traveller Nancy Campbell digs deep into the meanings of fifty words for snow. In Japanese we encounter yuki-onna \u2013 a 'snow woman' who drifts through the frosted land. In Icelandic it is hundslappadr\u00edfa \u2013 'snowflakes as big as a dog's paw' \u2013 that softly blanket the streets. And in M\u0101ori we meet Huka-rere \u2013 'one of the children of rain and wind'. From mountain tops and frozen seas to city parks and desert hills, each of these linguistic snow crystals offers a whole world of myth and story \u2013 the perfect winter gift. 'Absolutely exquisite. This little book is a work of art. It is impossible to imagine the reader who will not love it.' Horatio Clare, author of The Light in the Dark 'This stunning book made me want to pack all my woolies, candles, ample firewood and enough books for a year \u2013 and head to as northerly a location as I could find.'

Journalism is changing.    The demand for information about the world we live in has never been greater. But those charged with obtaining it are under constant pressure. Newspapers are closing, traditional news outlets are cutting jobs and losing money. Fake news and disinformation are spreading across social media.    Despite that, the best reporters continue to do what they always have \u2013 provide fair, accurate and reliable coverage of issues that matter most to us. And increasingly they are being joined by a new army of citizen journalists determined to fill gaps in local coverage.    In this new world, one thing everyone needs to know is how to report well.    Whether you're starting out in community journalism or working at a major news organization; whether you're working on traditional or new platforms; whether you want to learn the basics of good reporting or remind yourself of what the best reporting can and should be,  The Ten Rules of Reporting  is your essential guide to quality journalism.    Alan Sunderland has been a journalist for more than 40 years, covering almost every beat and news-type. He was most recently the editorial director of the ABC, in charge of reporting standards and ethics. In this book, Alan distills decades of experience into a one-stop handbook that will guide you through the dangers of fake news and spin, teach you how to get the facts and earn the public's trust, and make you a better reporter.

                "The Inner Game of music is that which takes place in the mind, played against such elusive opponents as nervousness, self doubt, and fear of failure. Using the same principles of \"natural learning\" W. Timothy Gallwey developed so successfully for tennis, golf, and skiing and applying them to his own field, noted musician Barry Green shows how to acknowledge and overcome these internal obstacles in order to bring a new quality to the experience and learning of music. It is also ideal for those who don't play an instrument but who feel their appreciation of music will be enhanced if they understand more about the process of playing. In precise, easy to understand language, Green and Gallwey explain how natural skills can be nurtured and enhanced, and through a series of special exercises they demonstrate the ways in which musicians can achieve exact intonation, artistic phrasing, and improved technique. Ensemble playing, improvisation, composition and creativity, and listening skills are discussed throughout. A methodology with a proven track record, this will be invaluable to anyone seriously interested in music, professional or amateur, composer, performer, or an appreciative listener. "

Vino  dives into the dynamic landscape of Italian wine today, where a new generation of winemakers is eschewing popular international styles, championing long-forgotten indigenous grapes, and adopting sustainable approaches best suited for their local climates. \u00a0 In an epic quest through Italy\u2019s 20 regions that takes readers from the steep hills of Valle d\u2019Aosta to the near-tropical climates of Sicily, Campanale uncovers and profiles the diversity of real Italian wine and the most exciting, game-changing producers in each area. Readers will leave with countless recommendations for exceptional winemakers and be armed with Campanale\u2019s empowering new rubric of quality (say goodbye to the Italian wine pyramid). Full of colorful stories and in-depth explorations of the modern craft,  Vino  proves there's never been a better time to drink Italian wine. "

In this book, you'll find: - An overview of the different types of whiskeys, including the rules and identities of each. He also includes information on craft whiskeys, which tend to be more creative and freewheeling than the styles made by traditional producers. - Exploration of the key whiskey ingredients, with a close look at the flavor contributions of malt, peat, corn, rye, wheat-even water matters. - Distillation for non-distillers and the beauty of barrels: Whiskey is both an art and a science, and what's in the glass is affected by things like pot stills vs. column stills, barrel char, and of course, time. - Numerous interviews with master distillers, still makers, and other artisans at the top of their field. - Tasting notes throughout so you can identify the whiskeys you might want to try next. You'll want to do the homework with whiskey as the subject!. "

It's not a personality flaw, it's a complex trait with many positive aspects. However, shyness means many kids struggle to speak up in class, get involved in activities, make friends, put themselves forward, and compete. As a result they can miss out on exciting opportunities, and are often overlooked, ignored, and sidelined... but it doesn't have to be this way.  Shy And Mighty  offers a new way of looking at the subject that will comfort and reassure shy children and help them overcome the aspects of their shyness that are holding them back, without pretending to be something they're not. Packed with simple tools and ideas to help children take small steps to get more involved, share their ideas, and make friends,  Shy and Mighty  also explores the science behind shyness, the potential costs of shyness, and more. Combining personal experience with extensive research and feedback from parents and children,  Shy and Mighty  will help kids go from invisible, to invincible! \u00a9 2022 Nadia Finer \u00a9 2022 DK Audio.

                "A vividly written and timely polemic tackling the burning injustices shaping British society today. 'Intelligently written and powerfully argued.' Paul Mason 'Witty, scathing, and entertaining.' Danny Dorling Journalist Sam Bright is a Northerner living in London. He is just one of the millions of people clinging on to the coattails of the capital, sucked in by the prospect of opportunities that the rest of the United Kingdom does not enjoy. Our capital is a vast melting pot of languages, cultures, and ideas, and rightly celebrated for it. For many, though, there is no other option. The only place to access the opportunities this country offers is London. Banking, law, politics, advertising, architecture, the arts and the media are all concentrated here. It is almost impossible to reach the heights of any profession without joining the grey hoards queuing for the next tube. As the economic, political, and cultural epicentre of the country, Fortress London acts more like a renaissance city-state like Florence or Venice than the capital of a modern nation-state. And the gluttony of London, compared to the malnourishment of our regions, dramatically affects life chances in Britain. Fortress London argues that to address Britain's manifold problems, we need first to end the hegemony of its capital. Enriched by a vast array of interviews and statistics, it will examine how our individual destinies, from childhood to death, are determined by the disproportionate power of London. It will explain why regional inequality has fallen off the Left's radar, even as the Right pays lip service to it, and it will draw on international comparisons to show where we have gone wrong and, crucially, how we can fix it. Sam Bright's clear-eyed intervention will convince you that regional inequality is the problem \u2014 and that now is the time for change. "

                "A fascinating, enchanting and painfully personal look at the meaning of luck, and the way in which it has shaped our shared history and continues to inflect our day to day lives. What does it mean to be lucky? How might we mitigate the effects of bad luck and maximise those of good? Is there actually such a thing as 'luck'\u2014some force that intervenes between desire and its consummation, that impedes or hastens it? To answer these questions, David Flusfeder sets out on a search for the definition of luck. This quest will take him to Siberia, Versailles, the Old Testament desert; play roulette in Baden-Baden with Dostoevsky; visit a Cambridge fairground with Wittgenstein; meet the sixteenth-century poet Thomas Bastard, who challenged Fortune, and lost; find Nietzsche on the slopes of Vesuvius; learn about the pioneers of probability; the twentieth-century art investigators of chance and possibility; and the intensely personal story of his father's good fortune in escaping war-time Poland. Starting at the British Library in London, and following the dictates of an online randomiser that decided the chapter order, Flusfeder follows in the footsteps of some victors of luck and those who were defeated by it, from ancient times to the modern day. Luck asks fundamental questions about the world, ourselves, our place in it. In these questions, about our relationships to fortune, to risk, to opportunity, to chance, destiny and fate, we find ourselves deciding who we are and how we might choose to live. "

A board book bestseller \u2013 now in audio! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood development and activism against injustice, this topic-driven book offers clear, concrete language and imagery to introduce the concept of consent. This book serves to normalize and celebrate the experience of asking for and being asked for permission to do something involving one's body. It centers on respect for bodily autonomy, and reviews the many ways that one can say or indicate \"No.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race, gender, and our bodies from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This audiobook offers a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult.

Her story came to light when her secret papers were finally declassified in 2015. From thwarting notorious rumrunners with only paper and pencil to \"counter-spying into the minds and activities of\" Nazis, she held a pivotal role in the early days of US cryptology. No code was too challenging for her to crack, and her work undoubtedly saved thousands of lives. "

Sir Ken Robinson changed the lives of millions of people. The embodiment of the prestigious TED conference, his TED Talks are watched an average of 17,000 times a day\u2014a figure that Chris Anderson, Head of TED, says is the equivalent of selling out the Millennium Dome every night for fifteen consecutive years. A  New York Times  bestselling author, Sir Ken\u2019s books have been translated into twenty four languages. \u00a0 In his final years, Sir Ken was working on a book that would serve as his manifesto. This book was being written for both new and dedicated audiences alike as a coherent overview of the arguments that he dedicated his life to, and as a pivotal piece of literature for the education revolution he began. When Sir Ken received his cancer prognosis in August 2020 he asked his daughter and collaborator, Kate Robinson, to finish writing this manifesto and continue his work. \u00a0 At its core, Sir Ken\u2019s work is a love letter to human potential\u2014a celebration of what we as a species are capable of doing, and of being, if we create the right conditions. It is a rallying cry to revolutionize our systems of education, and the ways in which we run our businesses and structure our social systems, so that they bring out the best in each and every person. Sir Ken often observed that what separates us from the rest of life on Earth is our power of imagination: the ability to bring to mind things that are not present to our senses. It is imagination that allows us to create the world in which we live, rather than just exist in it. It also gives us the power to recreate it. "

                "Coinage-it is one of the most successful and consistent technologies ever invented. Nothing else we still use in everyday life has a history quite like it. Look around at all the things that would bewilder a Greek, Roman, or Renaissance ancestor; then, dig into your purse or pocket for that one artifact that they would immediately recognize. Historian Frank L. Holt takes us on a journey through the history of numismatics, the study of coins-one of the oldest and most important contributions to the arts and humanities. For 2600 years, poets, economists, philosophers, historians, and theologians have pondered the mysteries of money. Who invented coins, and why? Does coinage function beyond our control? How has it changed world history and culture? What does numismatics reveal about our past that could never be discovered from any other source? How has numismatics advanced using modern science? Does it still suffer from racist ideas about physiognomy and phrenology? The approach taken in this book is as multifaceted as coined money itself. Coins are integral to our economic, social, political, religious, and cultural history. When Money Talks explores each aspect of coinage, and takes a special interest in how coins have appeared in literature and pop culture, ranging in its analysis from Greek drama and the New Testament to TV sitcoms and meme theory.

It's baggy, boneless body sprouts eight arms covered with thousands of suckers\u2014suckers that can taste as well as feel. The octopus also has the powers of a superhero: it can shape-shift, change color, squirt ink, pour itself through the tiniest of openings, or jet away through the sea faster than a swimmer can follow.   But most intriguing of all, octopuses\u2014classed as mollusks, like clams\u2014are remarkably intelligent with quirky personalities. This book, an inquiry into the mind of an intelligent invertebrate, is also a foray into our own unexplored planet. These thinking, feeling creatures can help readers experience and understand our world (and perhaps even life itself) in a new way. "

                "Psychology is part of everyone's experience: it influences the way we think about everything from education and intelligence, to relationships and emotions, advertising and criminality. People readily behave as amateur psychologists, offering explanations for what people think, feel, and do. But what exactly are psychologists trying to do? What scientific grounding do they have for their approach? This Very Short Introduction explores some of psychology's leading ideas and their practical relevance. In this new edition, Gillian Butler and Freda McManus explore a variety of new topics and ways of studying the brain. Until recently it was not possible to study the living human brain directly, so psychologists studied our behavior, and used their observations to derive hypotheses about what was going on inside. Now-through neuroscience-our knowledge of the workings of the brain has increased and improved technology provides us with a scientific basis on which to understand the structure and workings of the brain, allowing brain activity to be observed and measured. Exploring some of the most important advances and developments in psychology-from evolutionary psychology and issues surrounding adolescence and aggression to cognitive psychology-this is a stimulating introduction for anyone interested in understanding the human mind.

The Simpsons has been predicting major events with scary accuracy for over three decades, from Donald Trump's presidency to Disney buying 20th Century Fox. People just can't seem to get enough and are eager to know what it's going to predict next. This book goes behind the scenes of this adored cartoon series, and the family we've grown to love. Between Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and the rest of the Simpsons family, the show has stolen our hearts, and also left us amazed at how often The Simpsons predicts the future! So how do they do it? Is it a crystal ball? A fountain of knowledge? Have the writers gained the ability to travel through time? As shocking as it may seem, the answer is actually a little simpler than that. The cartoon crew is not in a secret society that can see the future, nor have they mastered the art of time travel. In The Simpsons Secret, learn more about: how The Simpsons is able to predict so many major events; how the show writers and producers come up with these ideas; and so much more about your favorite old-school cartoon family.

                "We never know when violence might be visited upon us-at home, in the workplace, at school-anywhere. Crime, sexual assaults, threats to our children, and terrorist attacks are all part of the global landscape. There are concrete measures anyone can take to mitigate danger and if necessary, to fight like a sociopath to defeat a sociopath. Robert Montgomery wrote Seconds to Live or Die to help you prevail in the face of unexpected violence. Drawing on his experiences as a career CIA officer, Robert offers up proven methods in self-protection for you and your family at home, on the street, and abroad. By practicing what you find in this book, you can learn to control fear, hone your situational awareness, and when the unimaginable happens, cycle through denial, deliberation, and into action to effectively fight for your life-irrespective of gender, experience, or physical ability. In violence, every fraction of a second can mean the difference between finding yourself above dirt-or six feet under. "
