Olivia Sedgwick never really knew her wealthy father, and she can't imagine why he bequeathed his summer cottage to her. It's a cozy little place, but Blueberry, Maine, holds only bittersweet memories for Olivia--heartrending memories of Zach, her long-lost first love, and the child she gave up for adoption. But what begins as a brief trip north to inspect her new property becomes a journey of revelation when she runs into Zach himself--and their beautiful daughter. And a threat to her future ... Zach is stunned that Olivia has returned to the small town where they fell in love. But what's more shocking is the realization that her father lied to them both, driving them apart all those years ago. Rebuilding their relationship offers a temptation that neither of them can resist. But someone is determined to break apart their small family once more, and will stop at nothing to do it. "

They have been tracking their old enemy Adrian Bogdan, a spy and vicious serial killer protected by powerful forces in the government.

                "\u201cThe most delightfully, wickedly entertaining duo in crime fiction.\u201d\u2014 The Plain Dealer  When a prominent politician is crushed by a fruit van making a delivery, the singular team of Arthur Bryant and John May overcome insurmountable odds to reunite the PCU and solve the case in this brainy new mystery from acclaimed author Christopher Fowler.    On a spring morning in London\u2019s Strand, the Speaker of the House of Commons is nearly killed by a van unloading oranges and lemons for the annual St. Clement Danes celebration. It\u2019s an absurd near-death experience, but the government is more interested in investigating the Speaker\u2019s state of mind just prior to his accident. The task is given to the Peculiar Crimes Unit\u2014the only problem being that the unit no longer exists. Its chief, Raymond Land, is tending his daffodils on the Isle of Wight and senior detectives Arthur Bryant and John May are out of commission\u2014May has just undergone surgery for a bullet wound and Bryant has been missing for a month. What's more, their old office in King\u2019s Cross is being turned into a vegetarian tapas bar. Against impossible odds, the team is reassembled and once again what should be a simple case becomes a lunatic farrago involving arson, suicide, magicians, academics and a race to catch a killer with a master plan involving London churches. Joining their team this time is Sidney, a young woman with no previous experience, plenty of attitude\u2014and a surprising secret. "

On a cross-country, redeye flight from Los Angeles to Boston, ten passengers awaken in Bangor, Maine, to find that the crew and most of their fellow passengers have disappeared. The airport shows no signs of life. Yet they hear \"radio static\" in the distance. Craig Toomey, an irritable investment banker on the verge of a breakdown, believes it is \"The Langoliers,\" monsters he was afraid of as a child who attack those who waste time. It's mystery author Bob Jenkins who first theorizes that they have flown through a time rip. Bob declares they have entered a place that forbids time travelers to observe or interfere with past events. It turns out that Craig is right, in a way. Two creatures, followed by hundreds more, emerge from the forest and head for the plane, consuming everything in their path. Can the survivors manage to fly the plane back to Los Angeles, back to the correct time, before The Langoliers succeed in their deadly mission to destroy the plane and the world? Dinah Bellman, the young blind girl whose aunt did not survive the time rip, has the greatest insight of all.   A spine-tingling, propulsive novella,  The Langoliers  is a brilliant read from the masterful Stephen King. "

But getting out is not easy as it would seem...  Located off a desolate stretch of Interstate 50, Desperation, Nevada, has few connections with the rest of the world. It is a place, though, where the seams between worlds are thin. And it is a place where several travelers are abducted by Collie Entragian, the maniacal police officer of Desperation. Entragian uses various ploys for the abductions, from an arrest for drug possession to \"rescuing\" a family from a nonexistent gunman. There's something very wrong here, all right, and Entragian is only the surface of it.   The secrets embedded in Desperation's landscape, and the evil that infects the town like some viral hot zone, are both awesome and terrifying. But as one of the travelers, young David Carver, seems to know\u2014though it scares him nearly to death to realize it\u2014so are the forces summoned to combat them. \"Stephen King's knack for turning the stray junk of pop culture into sick, darkly engrossing thrills has rarely been this much in evidence as in  Desperation \" ( Salon ).

And to keep the gold safe until they could return one of them placed a tapu on it. A tapu so that anyone who tried to touch the gold before they could come back for it would die.  Titch is determined to find the gold hidden somewhere on her family's farm. It might be tapu but that won't put her off. Her dad has gone bankrupt, and she has had to leave her home in the city and move back with her family to smalltown Ngaruawahia, start a new school and find new friends. Could the hidden gold be the way to fix her family's money problems? Titch, her cousins and new friend Tania set out to find the gold. But an unexpected encounter with a creature from the nearby river sees Titch learn about her own Maori heritage and the dangers of messing with tapu. A fascinating insight into Maori legend and culture,  Nine Girls  is a page-turning adventure that shows what it's like to feel like an outsider in our own world. Winner of the Margaret Mahy Book of the Year Award at the 2024 New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults!. "

Although the state of Maine has convulsed all summer with secession mania\u2014a mania that has simultaneously spread across other states\u2014Jess and Storey figure it\u2019s a fight reserved for legislators or, worst-case scenario, folks in the capital. But after weeks hunting off the grid, the men reach a small town and are shocked by what they find: a bridge blown apart, buildings burned to the ground, and bombed-out cars abandoned on the road. Trying to make sense of the sudden destruction all around them, they set their sights on finding their way home, dragging a wagon across bumpy dirt roads, scavenging from boats left in lakes, and dodging armed men\u2014secessionists or U.S. military, they cannot tell\u2014as they seek a path to safety. Then, a startling discovery drastically alters their path and the stakes of their escape. Drenched in the beauty of the natural world and attuned to the specific cadences of male friendship, even here at the edge of doom, Burn is both a blistering warning about a divided country\u2019s political strife and an ode to the salvation found in our chosen families.

Luckily, those who survived have found a beautiful, fully-stocked private palace, with all the latest technological updates (though one without connection to the outside world). The house, however, has more secrets than anyone might have guessed, and a much darker reason for having been built and left behind. Kristen, the hyper-competent \"chief emotional manager\" (a position created by her eccentric, boyish billionaire boss, Sumter) is trying to keep her colleagues stable throughout this new challenge, but staying sane seems to be as much of a challenge as staying alive.  Being a woman in tech has always meant having to be smarter than anyone expects\u2014and Kristen's knack for out-of-the-box problem-solving and quick thinking has gotten her to the top of her field. But will a killer instinct be enough to survive the island?

Against all odds, Alex is given the position and quickly proves herself skilled at solving other people's problems. But soon, she begins to receive strange, potentially threatening letters at the office. Francis's murderer was never identified, turning everyone around her into a threat. Including her boss, editor-in-chief Howard Dimitri, who has a habit of staying late at the office and drinking too much.   As Alex is drawn into the details surrounding her predecessor's murder, her own dark secrets begin to rise to the surface and Alex suddenly finds herself trapped in a dangerous and potentially deadly game of cat and mouse that takes her all the way from the power centers of Manhattan to Francis Keen's summer house, where her body was found and where the killer may just be waiting for her.

At once an insightful look at tangled family dynamics and a wrenching story of youthful delusion, Rip Tide illustrates that for many women, the past is a ticking time bomb. The deeper we bury it, the bigger the boom. Spread out a blanket, crack open Rip Tide and prepare to be dazzled.\"\u2014Jillian Medoff, author of When We Were Bright and Beautiful    From the author of The Wild One, a heartfelt and suspenseful novel about two sisters returning to their childhood beachfront home who are forced to confront their traumatic past when a body washes ashore.   It's been fifteen years since Kimmy Devine promised herself she'd never move back to Rocky Cape, the idyllic South Jersey beach town where she grew up. She doesn't want to relive the crushing heartbreak and scandal that ravaged her world as a teen. Her younger sister Erin shares those feelings, the wounds she caused so many years ago forever binding her and Kimmy.  Yet here they are, back in their hometown: Kimmy, floundering after quitting her high-powered finance job in London to help her dad run the family's hardware stores; Erin, reeling from fertility issues and an ongoing divorce, begging to be taken seriously by her parents. The more time they spend in Rocky Cape, the stronger the pull of nostalgia, and both Erin and Kimmy slip on the past like a pair of last year's sandals, forgetting about the blisters when worn too long.  As the sisters celebrate their homecoming at their parents' yacht club, a handful of familiar faces arrive to dampen the revelry. The next morning, a body is found floating nearby and long-buried secrets from their adolescence begin to emerge. Someone from the sisters' past, it seems, is out for revenge.  Told in fast-paced, dual timelines, Rip Tide is a steamy, tension-filled tale of suspense about family, friendships broken and repaired, young love lost and rekindled, forgiveness and second chances, taking control of your life, and the dangerous decisions we make when blinded by desire.

Losing yourself inside of a book can be dangerous. Not everyone finds their way out.  Agnes Corey, a junior editor at a small independent publisher, has been hired by enigmatic author Veronica St. Clair to transcribe the sequel to her 1993 hit phenomenon, The Secret of Wyldcliffe Heights. St. Clair has been a recluse since the publication of the Jane Eyre-esque book, which coincided with a terrible fire that blinded and scarred her. Arriving in the Hudson Valley at St. Clair's crumbling estate, which was once a psychiatric hospital for \"wayward women,\" Agnes is eager to ensure St. Clair's devoted fans will get the sequel they've been anticipating for the past thirty years.  As St. Clair dictates, Agnes realizes there are clues in the story that reveal the true\u2014and terrifying\u2014events three decades ago that inspired the original novel. The line between fact and fiction becomes increasingly blurred, and Agnes discovers terrible secrets about an unresolved murder from long ago, which have startling connections to her own life. As St. Clair's twisting tale infiltrates Agnes's psyche, Agnes begins to question her own sanity\u2014and safety. In order to save herself, Agnes must uncover what really happened to St. Clair, and in doing so, set free the stories of all the women victimized by Wyldcliffe Heights. "

                "In this gripping and intensely atmospheric debut, disquiet descends on a small town after the suspicious death of a beautiful young doctor, with all clues pointing to the reclusive young man who abandoned the community in chase of big city dreams but returned for the first love he left behind. Perfect for fans of  All Good People Here  and  Where the Crawdads Sing .   One peaceful morning, in the small, Puget Sound town of Point Orchards, the lifeless body of Dr. Erin Landry is found hanging from a tree on the property of prodigal son and failed writer, Elijah Leith. Sheriff Jim Godbout's initial investigation points to an obvious suicide, but upon closer inspection, there seem to be clues of foul play when he discovers that the circumstances of the beautiful doctor's death were ripped straight from the pages of Elijah Leith's own novel.   Out of money and motivation, thirty-three-year-old Elijah returns to his empty childhood home to lick the wounds of his futile writing career. Hungry for purpose, he throws himself into restoring the ramshackle cabin his father left behind and rekindling his relationship with Nakita, the extraordinary girl from the nearby reservation whom he betrayed but was never able to forget.   As the town of Point Orchards turns against him, Elijah must fight for his innocence against an unexpected foe who is close and cunning enough to flawlessly frame him for murder in this scintillating literary thriller that seeks to uncover a case of love, loss, and revenge.

Meanwhile, she's trying to find her sexy boyfriend the perfect gift, when all he wants is for her to show up to Valentine's dinner without danger on her heels.   Speaking of danger, Aiden Devlin is a little too secretive about his newest investigation, and something is hanging heavy over his head, but the stubborn Irishman refuses to share. Anna begins to fear that the 'bogus' murder charge might not be so bogus, and Nick truly could be in trouble.

During the season of love, Anna is forced to juggle her meddling family, solve the puzzle of the chaotic Cupids, save her potential brother-in-law, and arrive at Valentine's Day dinner in one piece.

So when he meets his sweet new neighbor, he puts her firmly in the friend zone, despite her soft hazel eyes, sharp wit, and tempting curves. It soon becomes difficult to keep her there because his brothers, his Nonna, and even his dog already adore her\u2014and he's not far behind.   Marlie Kreuk accepts the friend zone from the too sexy soldier because, hey, when a guy puts you there, he's a moron who doesn't deserve more. But when danger comes for her and Bosco risks his spectacular body to protect her, she can't help but wish for romance. Although, he's going to have to work for it.   With danger all around, Bosco and Marlie must face their explosive attraction while defeating deadly attackers, but even that is nothing compared to handling the Albertini matchmakers during the Christmas season. Busting out of that friend zone and surviving will take all of Bosco's training, Marlie's courage, and the magic of the holidays. "

Emlyn doesn't let herself think about the past. How she and her best friend, Janessa, barely speak anymore. How Tyler, the love of her life, left her half dead on the side of the road three years ago. Her new life is simple and safe. She lives alone in her Airstream trailer and works as a fishing and hunting guide in scenic Idaho. Her closest friends are the community's makeshift reverend and a handsome Forest Service ranger who took her in at her lowest. But when Tyler shows up with the news that Janessa is missing, Emlyn is propelled back into the world she worked so hard to forget. Janessa has become a social media star, documenting her #vanlife adventures with her rugged boyfriend. She hasn't posted lately, though, and when Emlyn realizes the most recent photo doesn't match up with its caption, she reluctantly joins Tyler to find her old friend. As the two trace Janessa's path through miles of wild country, Emlyn can't deny the chemistry still crackling between them. But the deeper they press into the wilderness, the more she begins to suspect that a darker truth lies in the woods\u2014and that Janessa isn't the only one in danger. Poignant, suspenseful, and unforgettable, Kimi Cunningham Grant's THE NATURE OF DISAPPEARING explores what it takes to start over\u2014and the cost of letting the past pull you back in. "

When the CIA approaches celebrity chef Sebastian Pike about using his award-winning food and culture travel show as cover for espionage, the outspoken bad-boy host says no. When they point out how roaming the globe interviewing foodies, heads of state, rock stars, journalists-in-exile, poets, subversives, supermodels\u2014even the pope\u2014gives him perfect cover, Pike smiles and says, \"F@#! no.\"   They push. Promising it's only one mission. Vowing he won't be in danger. Calling him the MVB: Most Valuable Bystander. They'd embed their top agent in his crew to do the spy work.   It's still no. But when they hit him with the patriotism card, he weakens. And when romantic sparks crackle between him and the female agent, Pike's all in, kicking off a romantic spy thriller in which the globetrotting celebrity chef uses his TV series to help sneak Putin's accountant out of Russia before he's exposed as a mole for US intelligence.   The high-stakes mission quickly puts Pike in harm's way. So much for MVB. There's danger, there's double dealing, there's torture, there's shooting with real bullets. Plus, a minefield of complications from the hot romance that grows between Pike and his gutsy CIA handler-producer, Cammie Nova.   From Paris to Provence, this chef is no bystander. Beyond their attraction, Pike and Nova become an operational team, not only to survive the perils they face but to pull off an operation fraught with one twist after another, capped by a shocking, emotional climax.

So when animal behaviorist Pru Marlowe gets a call about a kitten, she doesn't expect to find the cuddly creature playing beside the cooling body of prominent Beauville lawyer David Canaday. Heart attack? His three adult daughters angrily blame drug interactions, feline allergies\u2014and each other. And begin to feud over their father, his considerable estate, and that cute ball of fluff. While the cause of death is pending, each sister has an axe to grind\u2014with arguments that escalate when David's partner reads out the will.  Pru's special sensitivity to animals, which caused her to flee the cacophony of Manhattan for the quiet Berkshires, adds further problems. The local vet is overwhelmed as the animal hospital's money runs out. There's a needy Sheltie and some invasive squirrels, too. But the dead man's kitten, his former partner, and his troublesome family keep drawing \"wild-girl\" animal psychic Pru back in.  Despite the wry observations of her trusty tabby Wallis, now the wrongfully accused kitten's guardian, and the grudging compliance of her cop lover, this may be one time when Pru can't solve the mystery or save the kitten she wants to believe is innocent. A single witness knows the truth about that bright spring morning. How far can Pru investigate without risking her own hidden tale?. "

                "Pre-order the 13th chilling and adrenaline-packed Robert Hunter thriller, from the #1  Sunday Times  and multi-million-copy bestselling author, Chris Carter.   When a routine autopsy on what looked like a straightforward hit-and-run leads the LA Chief Medical Examiner, Dr Carolyn Hove, to discover some puzzling inconsistencies, she calls in Detective Robert Hunter of the LAPD Ultra Violent Crimes Unit. Not only did Dr Hove discover that the death wasn't caused by a hit-and-run, but she also found indications that the victim had been severely tortured prior to death.   What no one realises is that what Dr Hove has stumbled upon is just the tip of the iceberg and it will lead Hunter and his partner, Carlos Garcia, on the trail of a twisted and clever killer who hides in plain sight. A serial killer no one even knew existed \u2013 a killer who has always operated under the radar, expertly disguising every gruesome murder as an accidental death.   But with no leads as to why the victim was targeted, the investigation comes to a standstill, until another body is discovered with an alternative cause of death.   What becomes clear is that this serial killer isn't going to stop \u2013 unless Hunter and Garcia can get to him.   But how do you investigate a murder when you have no victims? How do you catch a killer who leaves behind no crime scene? How do you stop a ghost who no one can prove even exists?     PRAISE FOR CHRIS CARTER:   'This is a chilling, compulsive portrait of a psychopath, and proves that Carter is now in the Jeffery Deaver class'   Daily Mail    'Carter has a background in criminal psychology and the killers at the centre of his novels are all the more terrifying for it'   Mail on Sunday    'Carter is one of those authors who makes writing look effortless . . .

It is one of the most promising habitats for extraterrestrial life in the solar system, but the surface is unstable and dangerous, requiring the probe to be outfitted with artificial intelligence software. Melissa Shepherd, a brilliant programmer, has developed 'Dorothy', a powerful, self-modifying AI whose potential is both revolutionary and terrifying. When miscalculations lead to a catastrophe during testing, Dorothy flees into the internet. Former CIA agent Wyman Ford is tapped to help track down the rogue AI. As Ford and Shepherd search for Dorothy, they realize that her horrific experiences in the wasteland of the Internet have changed her in ways they can barely imagine. And they're not the only ones looking for the wayward program: the AI is also being pursued by a pair of Wall Street traders who want to capture her code and turn her into a high-speed trading bot. Traumatized, angry, and relentlessly hunted, Dorothy devises a plan. As the pursuit of Dorothy converges on a deserted house on the coast of Northern California, Ford faces the question: is rescuing Dorothy the right thing? Is the AI bent on saving the world . . . or on wiping out the cancer that is humankind?. "

                "Traffic cop Sal Delaney's past is catching up with her . . .     Sunday Times    best-selling author David Mark delivers a pulse-pounding new dark and gritty police procedural series set in the north of England, with a complex, intriguing female protagonist.          \"Mark is a superbly gifted writer who creates a bleak, unforgiving setting, deeply damaged characters, and a plot that ramps up the violence, tension, and suspense to an almost unbearable level before an explosive ending that will leave readers utterly shattered\"  Booklist  Starred Review   North of England .  Cumbria . Salome Delaney didn't have a great start in life. But her abusive childhood came to a tragic conclusion with the killing of her tyrant mother, Trina, by a jealous ex-boyfriend. At least, that's what the police say. Sal has never believed kind Wulf, who tried to protect her from her mother's dark side, could have committed such a crime, but the evidence was irrefutable . . . and who else could have done it? Now an adult, with a good job as a Collison Investigation Officer, Sal's done her best to put the past behind her. But one snowy morning she's called to an accident scene, and she recognizes the body - Barry Ford, the man her mother left Wulf for, all those years ago. It soon becomes clear this wasn't just an accident - it was murder. And Wulf, now out of prison, lives very close by . . . The question of who really killed her mother has haunted Sal her whole life, but as she launches a complex investigation, which gets darker by the hour, she starts to wonder if she really wants to know the answer after all.  This nail-biting series launch will appeal to fans of David Mark's critically acclaimed DS McAvoy series and readers of Denise Mina, Val McDermid, Ian Rankin and Peter Robinson. "

Marley Henderson is having the worst year of her life. First, a drunken mistake costs her everything, including her engagement and her closest friend, Thea. Then, a series of cruel rumors make her an outcast in the small Georgia community she calls home. Finally, a string of vicious arsons rip through town, leaving unchecked destruction\u2014and Thea\u2019s body\u2014in their wake. To the police, the case is cut-and-dry. Thea Wright was an unstable woman with a troubled history, and with no evidence to suggest otherwise, it seems clear that she was responsible\u2014not only for her own death but for dozens of arsons in the months preceding it. To Marley, though, the truth is less obvious. Reeling from the loss, Marley teams up with her ex-fianc\u00e9 to uncover the truth, but the deeper she digs into the night of Thea\u2019s death, the murkier the truth becomes, not just about the fires that have been raging through town all summer, but about the woman she thought she knew. To get to the truth, Marley will have to face Thea\u2019s lies, as well as the darkness she thought she put behind her long ago. Told in alternating POVs and dual timelines,  Burn It All  will have suspense fans flying through each twist and turn to reach the stunning conclusion. "

                "'An authentic and exciting story. The perfect summer read' - Clare Mackintosh, author of the bestselling  I LET YOU GO    From the author of the bestselling  Some Day I'll Find You  comes a novel of dark suspense set in the Lake District where, beneath the inviting water of the lakes, danger and death are waiting.   The summer of 1976 was unprecedented in living memory. Days of blazing sunshine bled into weeks and months. In the Lake District, Cumbria's mountains and valleys began to resemble a Grecian landscape. People swam in delightfully tropic waters to cool off. But, barely three feet below the surface, the temperature remained just a degree or so above freezing. As the summer blazed on, the drownings began...  What if someone wanted to take revenge? To remove an abusive, controlling partner from their life? When and where better to stage a murder and pass it off as an accidental drowning?. "
