                "Welcome to Fethering! Christmas turns killer for amateur sleuths Carole and Jude in this quirky, cozy, British village mystery.   Carole Seddon hates Christmas - it all seems rather a waste of time. So when her neighbour and best friend, Jude, drags her along to go shopping at a local store called Gallimaufry, she can feel her inner-Scrooge knocking. But the sales are on, and even Carole can't resist a bargain. A few days later, though, Gallimaufry is burnt down, and a body is discovered in the ashes. It seems like a tragic accident . . . but no-one can die of natural causes when a gun is involved. The victim was young, pretty and successful; who could possibly want her dead? With a host of suspects, the amateur detectives know they have their work cut out for them. And as they dig deeper they discover a host of half-truths and lies. It seems that someone in Fethering has a deep, dark, deadly secret - and is prepared to kill to keep it. "

On a spring morning in London\u2019s Strand, the Speaker of the House of Commons is nearly killed by a van unloading oranges and lemons for the annual St. Clement Danes celebration. It\u2019s an absurd near-death experience, but the government is more interested in investigating the Speaker\u2019s state of mind just prior to his accident. The task is given to the Peculiar Crimes Unit\u2014the only problem being that the unit no longer exists. Its chief, Raymond Land, is tending his daffodils on the Isle of Wight and senior detectives Arthur Bryant and John May are out of commission\u2014May has just undergone surgery for a bullet wound and Bryant has been missing for a month. What's more, their old office in King\u2019s Cross is being turned into a vegetarian tapas bar. Against impossible odds, the team is reassembled and once again what should be a simple case becomes a lunatic farrago involving arson, suicide, magicians, academics and a race to catch a killer with a master plan involving London churches. Joining their team this time is Sidney, a young woman with no previous experience, plenty of attitude\u2014and a surprising secret. "

                "When a little boy goes missing in the Nebraska prairie on the brink of a dangerous snowstorm, Kate Fox must sort truth from lies in order to save a life.  The race for Grand County Sheriff is hotly contested this year, and Kate Fox is throwing everything she's got into her very first campaign. It's difficult to tell whether the energetic interference of her large and boisterous family is helping or hindering her chances. And to complicate matters further, her opponent is also her ex.  All campaigning comes to a screeching halt when a child is reported missing. With a whopper of a winter storm bearing down on the Nebraska Sandhills, the rival candidate rushes to organize hunters and townspeople into search parties.  But the facts just don't add up for Kate and she declines to join the searchers, setting out to find the boy on her own. Can she trust her instincts and abilities? Or is Kate just letting her pride get the best of her? Her chances at becoming the new Sheriff, and a little boy's life, depend on the answer.  ___________________________________  Praise for Shannon Baker and the Kate Fox series:  \"With Stripped Bare, Shannon Baker offers readers a protagonist and a place they will love coming back to visit book after book.\" \u2014William Kent Krueger, New York Time bestselling author  \"...a compulsive, white-knuckle read peppered with interesting characters, a stunning setting, and a mystery that will keep you turning the pages late into the night.\" \u2014Linda Castillo, New York Times and USA Today bestselling author  \"Move over Longmire\u2014there's a new detective in town\u2014and you're going to love her!\" \u2014Hank Phillippi Ryan, USA Today bestselling author  \"...a terrific, fast-moving story with a savvy main character at the helm.\" \u2014Suspense Magazine  \"...winning characters and a stunning setting...\" \u2014Mystery Scene  \"A wonderful western mystery not to be missed!

                "Ancient gods. Modern war. And a star-crossed couple who could use some divine intervention.   The day I was drafted into the army of the gods, all I knew about being a MASH surgeon was what I'd learned from Hawkeye Pierce and Hot Lips Houlihan. Now here I am, Dr. Petra Robichaud, in the middle of an immortal war, assigned to a MASH camp with a nosy sphinx, a vegetarian werewolf, and an uptight vampire who really needs to get a life.   At least they're all too busy with their own dramas to discover my secret: I can see the dead. It's a forbidden gift, one that can get me killed, so I haven't told a soul.   Until the arrestingly intense Galen arrives on my operating table, half-dead and totally to-die-for. When his spirit tries to slip out of his fatally wounded body, I impulsively slip it back in. Call it a rash resurrection. One I'll live to regret.   Now Commander Galen of Delphi knows my secret, and he's convinced I'm part of an ancient prophecy\u2014one that can end the war for good. But taking a chance could cost me everything. And it would be easier to convince him to leave me alone, except now the prophecies are starting to come true...       Warning: This novel contains a hefty dose of danger, drama, practical jokes, pet swamp lizards, brooding demigods, adventure, romance, and heart\u2014in a MASH camp where everybody knows your business.       *The core of this book was originally called Immortally Yours, published by St. Martin's Press in 2012. The author has rewritten it into the way she always envisioned the story to be, which means it is now a romantic comedy instead of an angsty book. Oh, and there are a lot more pet swamp lizards, too.

                "BRAND NEW from Kelly Oliver's page-turning cosy mystery series  London 1918: Is Fiona Figg ready to exchange her sleuthing cap for a bridal veil?   Fiona is set to tie the knot with her dashing captain, Archie Somersby. But, while Fiona is busy planning her happily ever after, side-kick Kitty Lane and a group of judo-chopping suffragettes are kicking up trouble at the Piccadilly Jujitsu Club.  When Kitty is found unconscious in the locker room during a high-stakes competition, Fiona must forsake her bouquets and bridal gown to investigate. Her sleuthing leads to a posh lady's luncheon where a mysterious death crashes Fiona's wedding plans.  To make matters worse, the arch-nemesis of all things matrimonial Fredrick Fredricks is up to his old tricks, attempting to put the brakes on Fiona's journey down the aisle. Will he succeed in tripping up Fiona's wedding vows? Or will she finally say \"I don't\" to the charming devil?   With humour as sharp as a judo chop and suspense as tight as a wedding corset, Poison in Piccadilly invites you to matrimonial mayhem that will have you saying \"I do\" to laughter and \"forever more\" to page-turning suspense.

Twenty-one-year-old Ben Canaan attracts trouble wherever he goes. His father wants him to be a good Jewish son, working for the family business on Whitechapel Road, but Ben and his friends, the 'Good-for-Nothings', just want adventure. Then the discovery of an enigmatic letter and a photograph of a beautiful woman offer an escapade more dangerous than anything he'd imagined. Suddenly Ben is thrown into a mystery that takes him all the way to Constantinople, the jewel of an empire and the centre of a world on the brink of war. His only clue is three words: 'The White Death'. Now he must find what links a string of grisly murders, following a trail through kingmaking and conspiracy, poison and high politics, bloodshed and betrayal. In a city of deadly secrets, no one is safe - and one wrong step could cost Ben his life. "

LOS ANGELES, 1963: Korean War veteran Harry Ingram earns a living as a news photographer and occasional process server: chasing police radio calls and dodging baseball bats. With racial tensions running high on the eve of Martin Luther King\u2019s Freedom Rally, Ingram risks becoming a victim at every crime scene he photographs. When Ingram hears about a deadly automobile accident on his police scanner, he recognizes the vehicle described as belonging to his good friend and old army buddy, a white jazz trumpeter. The LAPD declares the car crash an accident, but when Ingram develops his photos, he sees signs of foul play. Ingram feels compelled to play detective, even if it means putting his own life on the line. Armed with his wits, his camera, and occasionally his Colt .45, \u201cOne-Shot\u201d Harry plunges headfirst into the seamy underbelly of LA society, tangling with racists, leftists, gangsters, zealots, and lovers as he attempts to solve the mystery. Master storyteller and crime fiction legend Gary Phillips has filled the pages of One-Shot Harry with fascinating historical cameos, wise-cracks, tenderness, and an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride of a plot with consequences far beyond one dead body.

                "When Operation Surgical Strike, a police sting designed to catch Colombian drug traffickers in the act of selling a large consignment of cocaine to undercover police officers, goes horribly wrong, suspicion quickly falls on one of the police officers involved: \"Stegs\" Jenner. Stegs is no ordinary cop. Something of a maverick, he has in the past played the role of a criminal just a little too well. Now suspended from duty, and with his close friend killed in the shoot-out, he determines to go at it alone.  DI John Gallan and his partner Tina Boyd are part of the subsequent investigation that will take them to the heart of one of London's most notorious criminal gangs. What they cannot know is that they've also embarked on a journey that will lead one of them straight into the rifle sights of the enemy. "

                "A gripping, enigmatic collection of linked short stories about the reverberations of a serial killer's crimes in the lives of everyday people.    In the small town of Barrow, Australia, people go about their ordinary lives. They drive to work through the dense state forest. They raise their families. They flirt and yearn. They lie and confess. Some of them leave home. Some of them return.  Darkness thrums beneath the surface of these ordinary lives: the violence of one man, a serial killer whose murders made Barrow infamous. His twelve victims\u2014women, men, mostly young\u2014are long gone, but their deaths are felt, beyond the forest where they were buried, beyond this country, beyond even this time. In the past, where a young woman on a school trip to Rome sees something she shouldn't have. In the present, where a man confronts an ancient grief on the suburban streets of Texas. In the future, in the hands of journalists and podcast hosts and television actors whose livelihoods hinge on the twin spectacles of loss and violence.   Highway Thirteen  is a luminous wonder: a book about the collisions between public and private selves, between parents and children, between history and what comes after, between the living and the dead. Fiona McFarlane's roving vision is itself a story about stories\u2014those we tell, retell, forget, sell, disprove, inherit, live through\u2014and a work of extraordinary power and magic. "

And the only way she could make that happen was to sell her body, to exchange sex for money. But her plan falls apart when she arrives in London at the start of the Covid pandemic. She risks everything to support her family - but as the country goes into lockdown she runs into Russian gangsters who have their own plans for her. Before long the Russians are forcing her to work for them. If she refuses, they'll kill her. Now it's not about working for a better life - now it's a matter of survival.

He was a journalist for more than ten years on newspapers such as The Times, the Daily Mail and the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong.

He began writing full time in 1992. His bestsellers have been translated into more than ten languages. He has also written for television shows such as London's Burning, The Knock and the BBC's Murder in Mind series.

For fans of dark fantasy like  Cemetery Boys ,  Noughts and Crosses  and  Threads that Bind  from major new YA talent Jamaican British author Nevin Holness   The first time Eli had tried taking magic that wasn't his, it had wrapped around his palms like razor wire, tight enough that he'd needed stitches. Since then, Eli had bled magic from a soul enough times that he knew the rhythm of it. He knew what kinds of magic to stay away from and which he could upsell, which would get stuck beneath his fingernails and which would crumble and turn to ash if he held on too tightly.   Eli doesn't know who he is or where he came from. What he does know is that he can pluck the magic from a soul like a petal from a flower. And he knows there is nothing he wouldn't borrow, steal or destroy in order to discover his past. Malcolm knows he can raise the dead with a wave of his hand but all he really wants is to be able to save his mother. When Eli is sent to track down the legendary fang of the leopard god Osebo, he finds himself entangled with an old and ancient power. Forced to team up, Malcolm and Eli must weave through the cracks of London, unearthing magic that should have stayed buried. Until finally, they face a power greater than either of them could have imagined: the daughter of Death herself . . .   Raising the dead is easy, living is harder. "

It\u2019s been five weeks since Io left Alante to follow the golden thread, and she\u2019s no closer to finding the god on the other end. She spends her days in constant, grueling travel and her nights worrying over the fate-thread she shares with Edei\u2014which seems to be fraying. Making matters worse, she and Bianca soon realize that their only lead has shaken them off, snapped the golden thread, and disappeared. But not before Io gathers some crucial clues. Her investigation leads her to a new mystery, a rash of sibling disappearances across the Wastelands that seems to be connected to the murders in Alante. And all signs point to Nanzy, the golden city, as the center of the whole conspiracy. As Io and Bianca make their way to Nanzy, they face powerful enemies, find allies new and old, and uncover a horrifying plot that traces back centuries. The more Io learns, the more she begins to suspect that the future of the world may truly rest on her shoulders. But she will have to determine how much of the future is her choice\u2014and how much is simply her fate. "

Martha wasn't afraid of any headless horsemen, or nuns haunting the local ruins; it was Charlie, always Charlie she was afraid would find her.  When an anonymous letter is delivered to the Clarendon English Dictionary, it is rapidly clear that this is not the usual lexicographical enquiry. Instead, the letter hints at secrets and lies linked to a particular year. For Martha Thornhill, the new senior editor, the date can mean only one thing: the summer her brilliant older sister Charlie went missing. After a decade abroad, Martha has returned home to the city whose ancient institutions have long defined her family. Have the ghosts she left behind her been waiting for her return? When more letters arrive, and Martha and her team pull apart the complex clues within them, the mystery becomes ever more insistent and troubling. It seems Charlie had been keeping a powerful secret, and someone is trying to lead the lexicographers towards the truth. But other forces are no less desperate to keep it well and truly buried. "

                "In this unputdownable WWII series, Paris detective Henri Lefort, must solve a complex case when a man is murdered on the policeman's own doorstep.   January 1941: It's cold and still dark when Paris Detective Henri Lefort wakes up to an empty apartment, irritated with his roommate for not even starting the coffee. Irritation turns to suspicion when he starts his walk to work and spots a large blood stain in front of the building. At the office his boss, chief of homicide, is incredulous that Henri didn't hear the gunshot that killed a man right outside his apartment. On the plus side, this means that Henri isn't a witness and can investigate the case. It first appears that the dead man is a nobody\u2014but Henri soon finds out he's a nobody with a classified police file. Henri confronts his bosses and then the Germans, but is stonewalled. So he turns his investigation to the other tenants in his building. Coincidentally, each resident claims ignorance. When Henri learns that the dead man was a German agent, he must face the real possibility that one of his friends and neighbors is a killer. It's his job to find the truth no matter what, but when he does he faces the biggest dilemma of his career\u2014whether in times like these the rules of justice should be, just sometimes, trumped by the rules of war.
