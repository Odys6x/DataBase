Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven audiobook offers clear, concrete language to introduce the concept of BODY LIBERATION. This audiobook serves to celebrate the uniqueness of your body and all bodies, and addresses the unfair rules and ideas that currently exist about bodies. It ends with motivational action points for making the world more fair for all! While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. "

When she was just a tiny baby, something terrible happened to Lexi. It left her with an out-of-control body and without a voice. Now, as a precocious, superhero-obsessed thirteen-year-old, Lexi is counting down the final 24 hours to a risky brain surgery that might help her talk or\u2014dare she dream it?\u2014to walk and use her hands.  As surgery grows closer, Lexi finds an urgent, relentless need to share the story of the year in her life she calls The Year of the Buttered Cat. That year, on the verge of shutting out the rest of the world, Lexi began a gutsy and solitary quest to find her \"missing\" body... and she learns new ways to reach out to the world to save her friendships and uncover the startling truth about what happened to her as a baby.  In the spirit of  Wonder  by R.J. Palacio and  Out of My Mind  by Sharon M. Draper, here is a riveting story that offers empowering messages of friendship, family, and the art of redefining ourselves. "

Jin and her family were poor, but like kids everywhere, she still found a way to have fun and get into lots of mischief climbing trees, digging for mushrooms, and even looking for wolves. This early middle grade memoir invites listeners to join Jin and her family in the outskirts of Inner Mongolia to remind us that though we all have different customs and traditions, we are more alike than not, and that mischief lives within all of us.

                "From award-winning author Candace Fleming, comes the powerful and fascinating story of the brave and dedicated young women who helped turn the tides of World War II for the Allies, with their hard work and determination at Bletchley Park.     \"You are to report to Station X at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, in four days time....That is all you need to know.\" This was the terse telegram hundreds of young women throughout the British Isles received in the spring of 1941, as World War II raged. As they arrived at Station X, a sprawling mansion in a state of disrepair surrounded by Spartan-looking huts with little chimneys coughing out thick smoke-these young people had no idea what kind of work they were stepping into. Who had recommended them? Why had they been chosen? Most would never learn all the answers to these questions.  Bletchley Park was a well-kept secret during World War II, operating under the code name Station X. The critical work of code-cracking Nazi missives that went on behind its closed doors could determine a victory or loss against Hitler's army. Amidst the brilliant cryptographers, flamboyant debutantes, and absent-minded professors working there, it was teenaged girls who kept Station X running. Some could do advanced math, while others spoke a second language. They ran the unwieldy bombe machines, made sense of wireless sound waves, and sorted the decoded messages. They were expected to excel in their fields and most importantly: know how to keep a secret.  Candace Fleming is the award-winning and highly acclaimed author of  Crash from Outer Space ,  The Curse of the Mummy , and many other nonfiction books for young readers. With her canny and compelling narrative voice she makes history come alive. Thick with tension and suspense, this is an extraordinary and relatively unknown story of World War II that will fascinate listeners who will be thrilled to see young people playing such an important role in the wartime effort.

                "Learn how a young girl who lived on a Christmas tree farm grew up to become one of the most celebrated musical artists of the twenty-first century\u00a0in this addition to the\u00a0#1  New York Times  bestselling series.  Taylor Swift always knew she wanted to be a country music artist, so at age thirteen, she convinced her parents to move their family out of Pennsylvania to Nashville. As a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, Taylor wrote songs about teenage heartbreak and fitting in with her peers, and she performed these and other tunes at open mic nights and karaoke events. Breaking into the music industry took longer than she expected because record executives thought there was no place in country music for her songs. But Taylor was fearless and proved them wrong. Since the release of her self-titled debut album in 2006, Taylor Swift has dominated the music charts, reinvented her sound, won numerous awards, shaken off public criticism, and spoken up for herself and others.\u00a0 Whether you're a lifelong Swiftie or someone who just loves learning about musicians, this\u00a0enchanting book will teach you all about the experiences that helped Taylor Swift become the successful superstar many kids and adults looks up to.

                "A moving true story for children ages 6 to 9 about growing up in Japanese American incarceration camps\u00a0during World War II\u2014from the iconic  Star Trek  actor, activist, and author of the  New York Times  bestselling graphic memoir  They Called Us Enemy .          February 19, 1942. George Takei is four years old when his world changes forever. Two months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u00a0declares anyone of Japanese descent an enemy of the United States.  George and his family were American in every way. They had done nothing wrong. But because of their Japanese ancestry, they were removed from their home in California and forced into camps with thousands of other families who looked like\u00a0theirs.  Over the next three years, George had three different \u201chomes\u201d: the Santa Anita racetrack, swampy Camp Rohwer, and infamous Tule Lake. But even though they were now living behind barbed wire fences and surrounded by armed soldiers, his mother and father did everything they could to keep the family safe.  In  My Lost Freedom,  George Takei looks back at his own memories to help children today understand what it feels like to be treated as an enemy by your own country. This is a story of a family\u2019s courage, a young boy\u2019s resilience, and the importance of staying true to yourself in the face of injustice. "

Here's the  true  story of America, from the Chinese American perspective.   A Junior Library Guild Gold Standard Selection  If you've learned about the history of Chinese people in America, it was probably about their work on the railroads in the 1800s. But more likely, you may not have learned about it at all. This may make it feel like Chinese immigration is a newer part of this country, but some scholars believe the first immigrant arrived from China 499 CE\u2014one thousand years before Columbus did!\u00a0 When immigration picked up in the mid-1800s, efforts to ban immigrants from China began swiftly. But hope, strength, and community allowed the Chinese population in America to flourish. From the gold rush and railroads to entrepreneurs, animators, and movie stars, this is the true story of the Chinese American experience. "

                "The fascinating story of America's first female code-breaker, Elizebeth Smith Friedman As one of the world's greatest code-breakers, Elizebeth Smith Friedman saved many lives throughout the twentieth century, catching dangerous criminals with her brilliant mind. Yet, she has largely been written out of history books, unlike her famous code-breaker husband. Spying on Spies seeks to right this oversight. Whip-smart and determined, Elizebeth displayed a remarkable aptitude for language and recognizing patterns from a young age. After she became the Treasury Department's and Coast Guard's first code-breaker, she trained all her male colleagues and created her own top-notch code-breaking unit, the first ever led by a woman. During Prohibition, her work solving and intercepting coded messages from mobsters and criminal gangs led to hundreds of high-profile prosecutions, including members of Al Capone's gang. Her crowning achievement came during World War II, when Elizebeth uncovered an intricate network of Nazi spies operating in South America. She cracked supposedly unsolvable codes just like the much more famous Alan Turing did at Bletchley Park in England. Spying on Spies tells the inspiring story of a groundbreaking woman in STEM whose legacy deserves to come out of the shadows. This audiobook contains a supplemental PDF. "

                "From an award-winning author comes this biography about beloved librarian and storyteller Augusta Braxton Baker, the first Black coordinator of children\u2019s services at all branches of the New York Public Library.  Before Augusta Braxton Baker became a storyteller, she was an excellent story listener. Her grandmother brought stories like Br\u2019er Rabbit and Arthur and Excalibur to life, teaching young Augusta that when there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s always a way. When she grew up, Mrs. Baker began telling her own fantastical stories to children at the 135th Street branch of the New York Public Library in Harlem. But she noticed that there were hardly any books at the library featuring Black people in respectful, uplifting ways. Thus began her journey of championing books, writers, librarians, and teachers centering Black stories, educating and inspiring future acclaimed authors like Audre Lorde and James Baldwin along the way. As Mrs. Baker herself put it: \u201cChildren of all ages want to hear stories. Select well, prepare well and then go forth and just  tell .\u201d. "

In 2018, fourteen-year-old Claire Sarnowski stood with ninety-two-year-old Alter Wiener in front of the Oregon state senate to champion a cause the two friends both believed in: making Holocaust education mandatory in their state's public school curriculum. Theirs was an unexpected friendship\u2014she was in elementary school when they met, and he was an aging Holocaust survivor whose memoir she had read\u2014and together they were going to change the American education system.  Alter had spent decades speaking to audiences of all ages and backgrounds about the Holocaust, teaching that \"never forgetting\" could help spread tolerance and prevent such an atrocity from happening again. But Claire knew hate crimes were still being committed, in her own town and even in her own school. She didn't want Alter's efforts on Holocaust education to be in vain.  From strangers to friends to law-changing history makers, Claire and Alter's mission was always simple: Remember this story. This page-turning memoir is a tribute to a man who survived the worst of humanity, an ode to friendship and community, and an empowering call to activism. "

Perfect for readers of  The Boys in the Boat .  After the Japanese military bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, Japanese Americans became the subject of racism and discrimination within the United States. Many were rounded up and put in concentration camps. But even while this was happening, there were many Japanese American soldiers who fought to ensure that all Americans were safe during the biggest conflict in world history.  Facing the Mountain  is the story of three Japanese American soldiers:\u00a0Rudy Tokiwa, Fred Shiosaki, and Kats Miho, who volunteered for the 442nd Regimental Combat Team to fight for their country in World War II. The book covers the three soldiers' deployment to Europe and the struggles of their families back home. Woven throughout is the chronicle of Gordon Hirabayashi, one of a cadre of patriotic resisters who stood up against the government in defense of their own rights. Equal parts riveting war story, resisitance history, and courtroom drama,  Facing the Mountain  is a fascinating and impeccably researched book that will captivate young readers. "

                "An audiobook edition of the board book about grief, offering adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young children in an informed, safe, and supported way.  Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven book offers clear, concrete language to introduce the concept of grief. This book aims to normalize the topic of death by discussing what it means and how it feels to experience loss. It centers around several questions that arise about grief and honest, simple ways to answer them. While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about tough issues from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. There is simple and interactive text, and the backmatter offers additional resources and ideas for extending this discussion. "

                "The tale of friendship between two people, one Israeli and one Palestinian, that symbolizes the hope for peace in the Middle East. \"Makes an incredibly complicated topic comprehensible.\"\u2014 School Library Journal  In 1967, a twenty-five-year-old refugee named Bashir Khairi traveled from the Palestinian hill town of Ramallah to Ramla, Israel, with a goal: to see the beloved stone house with the lemon tree in its backyard that he and his family had been forced to leave nineteen years earlier. When he arrived, he was greeted by one of its new residents: Dalia Eshkenazi Landau, a nineteen-year-old Israeli college student whose family had fled Europe following the Holocaust. She had lived in that house since she was eleven months old. On the stoop of this shared house, Dalia and Bashir began a surprising friendship, forged in the aftermath of war and later tested as political tensions ran high and Israelis and Palestinians each asserted their own right to live on this land. Adapted from the award-winning adult book and based on Sandy Tolan's extensive research and reporting,  The Lemon Tree  is a deeply personal story of two people seeking hope, transformation, and home.

The inspiration for the Apple TV show  Best Foot Forward !  When he was ten years old Josh Sundquist had his leg amputated to treat bone cancer. But this is not a sad story; on the contrary, this memoir is a story of resilience, heart, and most importantly: humor. Young Josh had a lot of adapting to do after he lost his leg. He had to learn how to walk again. He had to accept that he wouldn't be able to try out for the travel soccer team. He knew his life would never be the same again. But when he sees a poster in the hospital elevator advertising skiing classes, he realized all might not be lost. Equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious,\u00a0 Just Don't Fall  is Josh's story of surviving cancer with 50/50 odds, learning to be a professional skiier, and making his way to being a bestselling writer and motivational speaker. Inspirational and moving, Josh's story is one that can be appreciated by readers of all ages. "

Earth is dominated by plants, which outweigh all other life - from tiny duckweed floating in our ponds to giant sequoia trees towering above us. It's easy to take plants for granted, but we depend on these light-eaters, oxygen-generators, and rain-makers for every breath of air and mouthful of food we take. But that's not all. In the world of plants, time passes more slowly, but if we speed months into minutes we can peer into this hidden world and realise: it's a battleground. Plants are working to thwart their enemies, and to trick animals into working for them. Right under your feet, and all around you, is a secret world you've probably never noticed. Until now. Let's explore our Green Planet: a secret world of plants that might change how you see plants forever . . . Discover all there is to love about our astonishing Green Planet, the stories of its inhabitants, and the challenges it faces. In collaboration with BBC Earth, this non-fiction book captures the intrigue, drama, and beauty of the groundbreaking new BBC TV series: The Green Planet. \u00a9 Leisa Stewart-Sharpe 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022.

She studied, invented, and persevered, not only creating a future for herself as a scientist, but making sure that the rainforests had a future as well. "

Jerry's vivid recollections and lively sketchbook drawings of his youth in postwar America tell an inspiring story of how a hardworking boy pursued his passion in less-than-ideal circumstances and became a legendary artist against all odds.  The audiobook includes a PDF of the sketches found in the book \u2014 composed in a way that differs from Jerry's intention but still captures his goal.  Jerry Pinkney drew everywhere, all the time. It was how he made sense of the world\u2014how he coped with the stress of being a sensitive child growing up in crowded spaces, struggling with a learning disability, in a time when the segregation of Black Americans was the norm. Only drawing could offer him a sense of calm, control, and confidence. When friends and siblings teased him about having the nickname \"Jerry\" as his only name, his mother always said, \"Just 'Jerry' is enough. He'll make something of that name someday.\" And so he did, eventually becoming one of the most celebrated children's book illustrators of all time and paving the way for countless other Black artists.

There is no \"good enough.\" For Ann, only the best will do. Award-winning author Kate Messner and costume historian Margaret E. Powell tell the powerful story of the groundbreaking Ann Lowe, who grew up in a small Alabama dress shop and became the first nationally known African American fashion designer. Sought after by millionaires and movie stars, her designs walked the red carpet and graced the wedding of Senator John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier. At a time when the world around her thought African Americans deserved no more than second-class treatment, Ann expected no less of herself, and no less for herself, than the best. "
