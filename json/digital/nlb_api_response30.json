Using a step-by-step approach, it begins with an assessment of the limitations of current implementation methods for packaged software. It then helps you to analyze your requirements and offers 10 must-know principles gleaned from real-world packaged software implementations. These 10 principles cover how to maximize enhancements and minimize customizations, focus on business results, and negotiate for success, and so on. You will learn how to best leverage these principles as part of your implementation. As you progress through the book, you will learn how to put packaged software into action with forethought, planning, and proper execution. Doing so will lead to reductions in implementation costs, customizations, and development time\"--Resource description p. "

                "Should we make people healthier, smarter, and longer-lived if genetic and medical advances enable us to do so?  The author asks this question in the context of genetic testing and selection, cloning and stem cell research, gene therapies and enhancements. The ethical questions explored include parental responsibility, the use of people as means, the role of hope and fear in risk assessment, and the dignity and meaning of life. Taking as a starting point the arguments presented by Jonathan Glover, John Harris, Ronald M. Green, Ju\u0308rgen Habermas, Michael J. Sandel, and Leon R. Kass, who defend a particular normative view as the only rational or moral answer, the author argues that many coherent rationalities and moralities exist in the field, and that to claim otherwise is mistaken. Features include:  The book introduces only one main ethical consideration with the introduction of a new scientific or medical practice, allowing the reader to gain a thorough picture of the practice and of the nuances of the ethical argument; Each chapter begins with a one-sentence summary of its contents, giving the reader an orientation to the text ahead; Summaries bring all the ethical considerations together, helping the reader see what has been claimed in the book and how these claims have been supported; Separate introductions for genetic practices and philosophical considerations help the reader keep the different dimensions analytically separated. -- Provided by publisher.

Sections on tools and troubleshooting give engineers deeper understanding and the know-how to create and maintain their own electronic design projects. Unlike other books that simply describe electronics and provide step-by-step build instructions, EE101 delves into how and why electricity and electronics work, giving the reader the tools to take their electronics education to the next level. It is written in a down-to-earth style and explains jargon, technical terms and schematics as they arise. The author builds a genuine understanding of the fundamentals and shows how they can be applied to a range of engineering problems. This third edition includes more real-world examples and a glossary of formulae. It contains new coverage of: Microcontrollers FPGAs Classes of components Memory (RAM, ROM, etc.) Surface mount High speed design Board layout Advanced digital electronics (e.g. processors) Transistor circuits and circuit design Op-amp and logic circuits Use of test equipment Gives readers a simple explanation of complex concepts, in terms they can understand and relate to everyday life. Updated content throughout and new material on the latest technological advances. Provides readers with an invaluable set of tools and references that they can use in their everyday work. "

                "\"Greening of the Supply Chain: A Guide for Asian Managers\" is an important contribution to the adoption of environmental initiatives by organizations to enhance business performance and contribute to environmental sustainability. The author defines greening the supply chain as addressing and minimizing environmental impacts of all activities related to the different phases of supply chain. These activities include pollution prevention, closed loop manufacturing and design for environment in the production/internal supply chain phase or inbound phase; green marketing, environment friendly waste management and green transportation for the outbound phase; and, consumers, recyclers, waste handlers and re-processors for the reverse logistics.This book constitutes a powerful diagnosis and prescription for accelerating the shift of industrial development in Asia to a trajectory of sustainability. It demonstrates that environmental improvement and economic development can go hand-in-hand in the region. This book also sets the stage for effective integration of suppliers, business partners, waste handlers and consumers in the move towards a green environment. -- Publisher description. "

It also covers: logistics information systems and Web-based logistics - helping to substitute information for inventory and work content; transportation and distribution - for connecting sourcing locations with customers at the lowest cost by, among other things, leveraging private and third-party transportation systems; and, logistics organization development - including the seven disciplines that link enterprises across the supply chain, as well as logistics activities within those enterprises.

Its ultimate goal is to make data understandable to computers, and thus open to far greater utility and manipulation. This special issue of AoIS presents cutting-edge research on both of these often opposed trends in computing and will support discussion on both the synergies and controversies inherent in the two technologies, while also considering what other technologies can contribute to both. Dramatic advances in service-oriented architectures, model-driven engineering, and Web mining technologies are but a few of the developments that might have a considerable impact on both Web 2.0 and Semantic Web, and they will all be covered in this volume.

The articles in this collection present case studies on Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia as a whole and focus on domestic definitions of threats and conceptualisations of security. These studies map the differing understandings of danger in this region and explore how contending narratives of \"threats\" and \"security\" affect the national maritime security policy deliberations within the claimant countries of this region. Those interested in maritime security and management in Asia will find this collection an invaluable addition to the literature on this topic.-- Provided by publisher. "

                "The first soil survey in the Philippines was done by Mr. Clarence Dorsey, an American soil scientist in the province of Batangas in 1903. The Soils of the Philippines, however, is the first comprehensive summary of more than a century of soil-survey work in this country. It integrates the soil concepts of the reconnaissance soil-survey results, which commenced as early as 1934 and continued until the mid 1960s, with the semi-detailed soil surveys that continue to this day. ?The result is the first-ever genetic key for classifying Philippine soils at soil series level; thus, making it possible for any newcomers to the soil survey field to confidently produce their own soil map, at a more detailed map scale, to suit the project requirements. This book brings together discussions on soils and soil mapping units and up-to-date international techniques and technologies. It makes soils relevant to current political realities and national issues. As soil survey moves from a reductionist agricultural-development planning tool to a more holistic and integrated approach, to enable us to understand our dynamic and complex environment, The Soils of the Philippines will be the only source of authoritative and updated data on soil resources for macro-level resource management planning for decades to come. With a vanishing breed of experienced soil surveyors, not only in the Philippines but also worldwide, it may remain the only book on Philippine soils for the next hundred years or more. Since soils follow a geological and not a human time frame, the contents of this volume will stay relevant for soil surveyors even in a fast changing world. As the country leaps from an agricultural economy towards modernization and a more diversified economic base, some of the soil series in the Philippines, for example the Guadalupe series underlying the skyscrapers of Makati City, are becoming extinct as a result of urban development. Therefore, this book serves as the repository for the soils that we possess, the soils that have been lost through decades of urbanization while, at the same time, it creates a soil classification system for the soils we are yet to discover.

                "Electrical Engineering 101 covers the basic theory and practice of electronics, starting by answering the question \"What is electricity?\" It goes on to explain the fundamental principles and components, relating them constantly to real-world examples. Sections on tools and troubleshooting give engineers deeper understanding and the know-how to create and maintain their own electronic design projects. Unlike other books that simply describe electronics and provide step-by-step build instructions, EE101 delves into how and why electricity and electronics work, giving the reader the tools to take their electronics education to the next level. It is written in a down-to-earth style and explains jargon, technical terms and schematics as they arise. The author builds a genuine understanding of the fundamentals and shows how they can be applied to a range of engineering problems. This third edition includes more real-world examples and a glossary of formulae. It contains new coverage of: Microcontrollers FPGAs Classes of components Memory (RAM, ROM, etc.) Surface mount High speed design Board layout Advanced digital electronics (e.g. processors) Transistor circuits and circuit design Op-amp and logic circuits Use of test equipment Gives readers a simple explanation of complex concepts, in terms they can understand and relate to everyday life. Updated content throughout and new material on the latest technological advances. Provides readers with an invaluable set of tools and references that they can use in their everyday work. "
