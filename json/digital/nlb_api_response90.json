                "\"Medea betrayed her father and left her homeland for the love of Jason. Then when he abandoned her, she murdered her children. But did she? And what of Clytemnestra, the conniving adulteress? For ten years she plotted the murder of her husband Agamemnon, King of Mycenae and Conqueror of Troy. How would she have told her story? The Greek myths as we know them were told for men by men. Yet they were the culmination of a long oral tradition in which both men and women shared. Using extant ancient literary sources as her guide, including the works of Homer, Aeschylus, Euripides and Apollodorus, Jane Cahill reconstructs the stories as they might have been told to women by women. These are stories of wronged women, inspired women, determined women, tender women. Medusa tells how it is to know that one look at her face will turn a man to stone, to be hated and feared all the time. Jocasta, Queen of Thebes, confesses her love for the young man who came to cave her city from the Sphinx&#x2014;her son, Oedipus. Each story is accompanied by extensive notes which discuss the ancient sources, explain relevant Greek concepts and customs, and serve as a guide to further reading.\"--pub. desc. "

Voices from Four Directions gathers stories and songs from thirty-one Native groups in North America-including the In\u0303upiaqs in the frigid North, the Lushootseeds along the forested coastline of the far West, the Catawbas in the humid South, and the Maliseets of the rugged woods of the East. Vivid stories of cosmological origins and transformation, historical events remembered and retold, as well as legendary fables can be found in these pages. Well-known Trickster figures like Raven, Rabbit, and Coyote figure prominently in several tales as do heroes of local fame such as Tom Laporte of the Maliseets. The stories and songs entertain, instruct, and recall rich legacies as well as obligations. Many are retellings and reinventions of classic narratives, while others are more recent creations. "

Beginning with an introduction to Navajo history and ethnography, the author explores the spiritual world of the Navajo, their ceremonial practices, and their conceptions of time and stellar motion. The Navajo depict the heavens in a group of sacred sandpaintings, and Griffin-Pierce shows how these images not only communicate the temporal and spatial dimensions of the Navajo universe but also present, in visual form, Navajo ideas about relationships among nature, self, and society. Beautifully illustrated by the author, this well-documented book is based on six years of fieldwork with Navajo chanters and on the author's twenty-year friendship with a Navajo family. Earth Is My Mother, Sky Is My Father is an engaging study for anyone who wants to better understand modern Navajo philosophy and sacred practices. "

A touch cozy fantasy and a touch horror, The Dollmakers is perfect for fans of Studio Ghibli films, the works of TJ Klune and Travis Baldree, and readers of Juniper & Thorn and The Goblin Emperor.   In the country called One, dollmakers are vital members of the community. An artisan's doll is the height of society's accomplishments, while a guard's doll is the only thing standing between the people of One and the Shod: vicious, cobbled monstrosities that will tear apart any structure\u2014living or dead, inanimate or otherwise\u2014to add to their horde.  Apprentice Shean of Pearl is a brilliant dollmaker. With her clever dolls, she intends to outsmart and destroy the Shod, once and for all\u2014a destiny she's worked her whole life toward accomplishing. But when the time comes for her dolls to be licensed, she's told her work is too beautiful and delicate to fight. A statement that wounds and infuriates her; the Shod killed everyone she loved. How could her fate be anything but fighting them?  In an attempt to help her see a new path for herself, Shean's mentor sends her on a journey to the remote village called Web, urging her to glean some wisdom from Ikiisa, a reclusive and well-respected guard dollmaker. But Shean has another plan: if she can convince the village of Web of her talents, the Licensor Guild will have to reconsider and grant her a guard's license. And what better way to convince them than challenging Ikiisa and instating herself as the official dollmaker of Web? Once she's done that, proving her dolls' worth in the fight against the Shod will be simple.  As simple, that is, as calling the Shod to Web... "

Weaving together Greek mythology, neuroscience, and memories inherited from her Korean grandparents, the narrator grapples with death by telling stories to her younger brother that ask what life means for him, for her, and for their family.   Recasting the myths of Eurydice, Orpheus, Persephone, and Hades through the lens of a Korean American family, Eunice Hong's debut novel explores the grief and love of a woman coming to terms with trauma, memory, and the inescapability of death.

                "Two lives are about to collide. A journey of self-discovery. For fans of dark fantasy like  Cemetery Boys ,  Noughts and Crosses  and  Threads that Bind  from major new YA talent Jamaican British author Nevin Holness   The first time Eli had tried taking magic that wasn't his, it had wrapped around his palms like razor wire, tight enough that he'd needed stitches. Since then, Eli had bled magic from a soul enough times that he knew the rhythm of it. He knew what kinds of magic to stay away from and which he could upsell, which would get stuck beneath his fingernails and which would crumble and turn to ash if he held on too tightly.   Eli doesn't know who he is or where he came from. What he does know is that he can pluck the magic from a soul like a petal from a flower. And he knows there is nothing he wouldn't borrow, steal or destroy in order to discover his past. Malcolm knows he can raise the dead with a wave of his hand but all he really wants is to be able to save his mother. When Eli is sent to track down the legendary fang of the leopard god Osebo, he finds himself entangled with an old and ancient power. Forced to team up, Malcolm and Eli must weave through the cracks of London, unearthing magic that should have stayed buried. Until finally, they face a power greater than either of them could have imagined: the daughter of Death herself . . .   Raising the dead is easy, living is harder. "

I killed three men as a child and earned the name Bloodletter. Then I set fire to the fabled Ashram. I've been a bird and robbed a merchant king of a ransom of gold.

It\u2019s been five weeks since Io left Alante to follow the golden thread, and she\u2019s no closer to finding the god on the other end. She spends her days in constant, grueling travel and her nights worrying over the fate-thread she shares with Edei\u2014which seems to be fraying. Making matters worse, she and Bianca soon realize that their only lead has shaken them off, snapped the golden thread, and disappeared. But not before Io gathers some crucial clues. Her investigation leads her to a new mystery, a rash of sibling disappearances across the Wastelands that seems to be connected to the murders in Alante. And all signs point to Nanzy, the golden city, as the center of the whole conspiracy. As Io and Bianca make their way to Nanzy, they face powerful enemies, find allies new and old, and uncover a horrifying plot that traces back centuries. The more Io learns, the more she begins to suspect that the future of the world may truly rest on her shoulders. But she will have to determine how much of the future is her choice\u2014and how much is simply her fate. "

With a power that will spare no one, Medusa begins to wonder if this is a blessing or a curse. Medusa only knows that she must leave the city she has come to call home before she harms another soul.\u00a0  Searching for a haven free from mortals, anger buoying her every step, Medusa journeys across ancient Greece.\u00a0Her eyes are hidden beneath a blindfold, with nothing but the snakes for company. Through her travels, Medusa discovers solace and understanding in the mythical figures she stumbles upon: A debaucherous wine god, an alluring nymph, and a three-headed dog. But one cannot escape fate\u00a0forever. As Perseus closes in, Medusa faces a choice: become the monster everyone expects her to be, or cling to the last piece of her humanity. "

Nine-year-old twins, Emma and Mart\u00edn, couldn't be more different in their personalities, interests, and even their looks. But one thing they absolutely agree on is that moving from Cuernavaca, Mexico, to Illinois is a terrible idea. Unfortunately, they're not given a choice when their dad lands his dream job as a middle school principal in Chicago. To help the twins stay connected to their Mexican heritage, their abuela gifts them a book of Mexican legends. The book turns out to be more than a going away present...it's a magical item that transports them directly into the legends!   In the first legend, Emma and Mart\u00edn encounter Tlaloc, the god of rain. Tlaloc is angry because his lightning bolt has been stolen, and his rage is manifesting as a torrential downpour over the ancient city of Texcoco. The rain won't stop until the lightning bolt has been returned, so Emma and Mart\u00edn set out to recover it.    Will they find Tlaloc's bolt in time to help the people of Texcoco save their home? Or will the wrath of the rain god mark the end of this legendary city?. "

The question stole my breath and burned my lungs in the silence that followed.\u00a0    I wanted to answer, to whisper yes into the space between us, but I was afraid.   All Gesela's life, her home village of Elk has been cursed. And it isn't a single curse\u2014it is one after another, each to be broken by a villager, each with devastating consequences. When Elk's well goes dry, it is Gesela's turn to save her town by killing the toad that lives at the bottom. Except...the toad is not a toad at all. He is an Elven prince under a curse of his own, and upon his death, his brothers come for Gesela, seeking retribution.  As punishment, the princes banish Gesela to live with their seventh brother, the one they call the beast. Gesela expects to be the prisoner of a hideous monster, but the beast turns out to be exquisitely beautiful, and rather than lock her in a cell, he offers Gesela a deal. If she can guess his true name in seven days, she can go free.  Gesela agrees, but there is a hidden catch\u2014she must speak his name with love in order to free him, too.  But can either of them learn to love in time?. "

                "A beautifully crafted, enriching saga inspired by East Asian mythology, The Melancholy of Untold History is Minsoo Kang's debut novel, steeped in history like R.F. Kuang's Babel, epic in scope like Anthony Doerr's Cloud Cuckoo Land, and lyrically exciting like David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, interweaving four complex yet entertaining stories as they shape and create a nation's literary narrative through the themes of love and grief.   A history professor mourning his wife. His young prot\u00e9g\u00e9's search for a path forward. Four witty mountain gods with much to say and not enough time to listen. A gifted storyteller bringing a world into being out of thin air...  Famous for his dispelling of the national myth, the Historian understands the power of narrative. He has inspired another young professor to search for her own truths, while trying to understand the way fiction creates fact and how sometimes the past can only be understood by filling in holes with a new narrative. Which is exactly what he needs when his wife passes away to parse meaning out of a world that no longer makes sense.   Together the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the Historian find comfort in each other. Yet they know their time together is fleeting, as time usually is. Only the gods have an abundance of time, and yet\u2014the two discover\u2014even that might not be so clear cut. Part of their homeland's myth tells of four gods who squabbled and argued and destroyed and rebuilt time and again.   Or did they?  Because, of course, even the gods need mouthpieces on earth. And the one the Historian knows of\u2014the elusive Storyteller\u2014may have just been spinning tales for his own amusement and, ultimately, revenge. By fabricating the exploits of the gods, he could have set a course for certain events to unfold and a particular story to survive today.   Spanning 3,000 years and multiple voices\u2014with tales within tales woven expertly together\u2014The Melancholy of Untold History reveals a people and its individuals who seek to confront the hardships of life through storytelling. Mixing the East Asian mythos with a postmodern approach to standard sci-fi/fantasy narrative tropes, Minsoo Kang has created a challenging, beautiful, sad, humorous, and ultimately unforgettable novel of love, grief, and myth-making.

Relics of a mysterious god, the Spice Gates connect the eight far-flung kingdoms, each separated by a distinct spice and only accessible by those born with a special mark.

As Amir makes his plan for freedom, he's drawn into a plot that threatens to unravel the power keeping the gates in balance. Gods, assassins and thronekeepers all have a vested interest in the spice trade, and Amir will have to decide what kind of world he wants to live in ... if the world survives at all.

Twelve-year-old Evie Mei Huang never did like helping in her mom's tailor shop. She hated helping to mend fraying clothes, how the measuring tape got all twisted up, and how pushy her mother's clients were. Most of all, she hates that her mother is dead and isn't here to help anymore. But when the universe sends a life preserver, Evie knows to grab it. So yes, it's weird when a talking monkey shows up and tells her that her plainspoken, hardworking tailor mother was actually the head of a Guild of magical weavers who can change the fate of a person with only a spool of thread. Very weird. But he also comes bearing news that her mother is trapped in Diyu, the Chinese underworld, and that only Evie can get her back. No pressure. The important thing is that Evie's mom isn't dead. And if she's got this one shot to bring her back and save her family, she's got to take it. Inspired by Chinese mythology, Aimee Lim's debut middle grade peers into the dark and gritty underworld, while showcasing the unbreakable bond between a family and the lengths we'll go to save them.

                "In Hawaii, a cast of women reckon with physical and emotional alienation, and the toll it takes on their psyches. A childhood encounter with a wild pua'a (boar) on the haunted Pali highway portends one woman's increasingly fraught relationship with her body during pregnancy. A woman recalls an uncanny experience, in which Elvis impersonators take centre stage, to an acquaintance who doesn't yet know just how intimately they're connected. An elderly widow begins seeing her deceased lover in the giant corpse flower a mourner has gifted her. Centering native Hawaiian identity, and how it unfolds in the lives, mind and bodies of kanaka women, the stories in Kakimoto's debut collection are speculative and uncanny, exploring themes of queerness, colonization and desire. Both a fierce love letter to mixed native Hawaiian and Japanese women and a searing dispatch from an occupied territory simmering with tension,  Every Drop is a Man's Nightmare  takes seriously the superstitions born of the islands. Kakimoto's characters seek pleasure and purpose even in absurd circumstances, often with a surprising sense of humor, and her stories treat Hawai'i as so much more than a postcard from paradise. "

I loved this book.\u201d \u2013 Kelly Link, Pulitzer Prize finalist and bestselling author of  Get in Trouble  and  The Book of Love  \u201cWhat\u00a0I love most about  Ninetails  is its fierce allegiance\u00a0to underdogs of all kinds, its careful\u00a0and myriad\u00a0empathy\u00a0for its characters, but also its pure and artisanal\u00a0delight in language and fictive possibilities.\u201d \u2014Ocean Vuong,  New York Times -bestselling author of  On Earth, We're Briefly Gorgeous  and  Time is a Mother  A \u201clyrical and virtuosic\u201d fabulist debut collection of stories re-imagining the nine-tailed fox spirit of Asian folklore (Gina Chung).  A fox spirit avenges a teen girl by seducing her abuser. A shapeshifting woman finds herself chased through the woods by fox hunters; meanwhile, an assassination plot called Operation Fox Hunt unfolds against the last Queen of Korea. Chinese migrants hoping to make new lives as \u201cpaper children\u201d in America find their pasts\u2014and their hopes for the future\u2014embodied in the foxes that haunt the harbor in 1900s Angel Island. In the nine tales of  Ninetails,  acclaimed poet Sally Wen Mao reimagines the fox spirit from Asian folklore\u2014a shapeshifter, shaman, and seductress\u2014as an icon of vengeance, solidarity and liberation. The characters of her stories are varied\u2014from silicone sex dolls who come to life with new purpose, to women whose crushes manifest as stones\u2014but they all reach for a common purpose: to find truth and belonging in a difficult world determined to consider them alien. With the fabulist vibrancy of Carmen Maria Machado, the sinuous world-building of Helen Oyeyemi, and the sensuous feminist rage of Han Kang,  Ninetails  is both timeless\u2014unearthing a cultural icon whose origins date back over a thousand years\u2014and timely in its contemporary political urgency.

                "Best-selling author Rick Riordan presents the sequel to Tehlor Kay Mejia's critically acclaimed own-voices novel about science-obsessed Paola Santiago.   \"Paola is a brilliant, furious girl who often trusts her brain but trips over her heart.\"\u2014Sarah Gailey, Hugo and Locus award-winning author of River of Teeth  Six months after Paola Santiago confronted the legendary La Llorona, life is nothing like she'd expected it to be. She is barely speaking to her best friends, Dante and Emma, and what's worse, her mom has a totally annoying boyfriend. Even with her chupacabra puppy, Bruto, around, Pao can't escape the feeling that she's all alone in the world.  Pao has no one to tell that she's having nightmares again, this time set in a terrifying forest. Even more troubling? At their center is her estranged father, an enigma of a man she barely remembers. And when Dante's abuela falls mysteriously ill, it seems that the dad Pao never knew just might be the key to healing the eccentric old woman.  Pao's search for her father will send her far from home, where she will encounter new monsters and ghosts, a devastating betrayal, and finally, the forest of her nightmares. Will the truths her father has been hiding save the people Pao loves, or destroy them?   Once again Tehlor Kay Mejia draws on her Mexican heritage to tell a wild and wondrous story that combines creatures from folklore with modern-day challenges.

The poor girl deserves a rest! But first she has to rescue Dante from the void, where he's been imprisoned by some unknown force. Even though Dante has turned against Pao, she can't just leave him there\u2014they've been friends for too long. Paola's prophetic dreams seem to have dried up, so she has to rely on one of her father's inventions to find a new rift where she can enter the void. His machine pinpoints a magical convergence in San Antonio,Texas\u2014but how is she going to get there from New Mexico? It just so happens that Emma's new group of politically active friends, the Rainbow Rogues, are planning a bus trip to New Orleans, which will take them through Texas. It's the perfect ruse for Paola, if she can stand being with the judgmental girls for that long. . . . With scientific assistance from her father, training from the Ninos de la Luz, and the emotional support of her best friend Emma, Pao makes it into the void. Once there she must face down not just one but two enemies: El Cucuy, the bogeyman . . . and someone even scarier who looks a lot like Pao herself. "

A goddess and a prince. A curse and an oath. A river whose course will change the fate of the world.   Ganga, joyful goddess of the river, serves as caretaker to the mischievous godlings who roam her banks. But when their antics incur the wrath of a powerful sage, Ganga is cursed to become mortal, bound to her human form until she fulfills the obligations of the curse.  Though she knows nothing of mortal life, Ganga weds King Shantanu and becomes a queen, determined to regain her freedom no matter the cost. But in a cruel turn of fate, just as she is freed of her binding, she is forced to leave her infant son behind.  Her son, prince Devavrata, unwittingly carries the legacy of Ganga\u2019s curse. And when he makes an oath that he will never claim his father\u2019s throne, he sets in motion a chain of events that will end in a terrible and tragic war.  As the years unfold, Ganga and Devavrata are drawn together again and again, each confluence another step on a path that has been written in the stars, in this deeply moving and masterful tale of duty, destiny, and the unwavering bond between mother and son.

Overworked, buried in debt, she senses the life she wanted slipping away\u2014while the world around her veers badly off course, hurtling toward economic and ecological collapse. She wants to find something better. But she has no idea where to start.\u00a0 In a sudden and unprecedented burst of rebellion, Jane decides to abandon everything she knows, leaving behind her relationships and responsibilities to go on the road. That\u2019s how she meets Barry, a brilliant and charismatic recluse living on an isolated homestead near New York\u2019s Canadian border. For years, in secret, Barry\u2019s chased an unlikely obsession: to build a pair of wings humans can fly in, with designs inspired by an obscure precursor to the Wright Brothers. It\u2019s no mere hobby. He\u2019s convinced his dream of flight will spark a revolution, delivering us from the degradation of modern capitalism and the climate chaos that awaits us.\u00a0 Jane is captivated by Barry\u2019s radical vision, even as his experiments become more dangerous. But she\u2019s equally drawn to the enigmatic Ike, Barry\u2019s gentle, thoughtful son, who\u2019s known no other reality\u2014and who only wants to keep his father alive, tethered to ground and to reason.\u00a0 So begins an inventive, dazzlingly beautiful story about the human desire for transcendence\u2014our longing to escape the mundane and glide into a euphoric future. Inspired by the myth of Daedalus and Icarus,  The Sky Was Ours  is a powerful and imaginative debut that explores the question: If you had access to technology that allowed you to escape the confines of your life, would you use it? And if Barry\u2019s wings really could change the world, would that be freedom?. "

                "\"Every once in a while, a book comes along that drops you into another world and takes you places you never could imagine. This is that book. An astounding accomplishment!\"  \u2014 R. L. Stine , author of\u00a0 Goosebumps  Set in 19th century Sri Lanka and inspired by local folklore, the daughter of a traditional demon-priest\u2014relentlessly bullied by peers and accused of witchcraft herself\u2014tries to solve the mysterious attacks that have been terrorizing her coastal village.  Being the daughter of the village Capuwa, or demon-priest, Amara is used to keeping mostly to herself. Influenced by the new religious practices brought in by the British Colonizers, the villagers who once\u00a0respected her father\u2019s craft have turned on the family. Yet, they all still seem to call on him whenever supernatural disturbances arise. Now someone\u2014or  something \u2014is viciously seizing upon men in the jungle. But instead of enlisting Amara\u2019s father\u2019s help, the villages have accused him of carrying out the attacks himself. As she tries to clear her father\u2019s name, Amara finds herself haunted by dreams that eerily predict the dark forces on her island. And she can\u2019t shake the feeling that it\u2019s all connected to the night she was recovering from a strange illness, and woke up, scared and confused, to hear her mother\u2019s frantic cries:  No one can find out what happened .

There lived a girl named Petra Pe\u00f1a, who wanted nothing more than to be a storyteller, like her  abuelita . But Petra's world is ending. Earth will soon be destroyed by a comet, and only a few hundred scientists and their children - among them Petra and her family - have been chosen to journey to a new planet. They are the ones who must carry on the human race. Hundreds of years later, Petra wakes to this new planet - and the discovery that she is the only person who remembers Earth. A sinister Collective has taken over the ship during its journey, bent on erasing the sins of humanity's past. They have systematically purged the memories of all aboard - or purged  them  altogether. Petra alone now carries the stories of our past, and with them, any hope for our future. Can she make them live again?. "

Thirteen years ago, Sylvia Gray's young daughter, Faye, attacked her babysitter in order to impress the Kingman, a monster she and her best friend had encountered on the Internet. When the now twenty-three-year-old Faye goes missing, leaving her toddler behind, Sylvia launches a search that propels her back into the past and back into the Kingman's orbit. With the help of her estranged husband and a sister she hasn't spoken to in years, Sylvia draws dangerously closer not only to Faye, but also to the truth about the monster that once inspired her. Will Sylvia be able to reach her daughter before history repeats itself? Or will it be Sylvia, this time, who loses her grip on reality and succumbs to the dark powers of this monstrous fiction? Both literary and suspenseful,  Monsters We Have Made  confronts the terrors of parenthood and examines the boundaries of love. Most importantly, it reminds us of the power of stories to shape our lives. "

A propulsive and piercing debut, set ten years before the events of Shakespeare\u2019s historic play, about the ambition, power, and fate that define one of literature\u2019s most notorious figures: Lady Macbeth.  Scotland, the 11th Century. Born in a noble household and granddaughter of a forgotten Scottish king, a young girl carries the guilt of her mother\u2019s death and the weight of an unknowable prophecy. When she is married, at fifteen, to the Mormaer of Moray, she experiences firsthand the violence of a sadistic husband and a kingdom constantly at war. To survive with her young son in a superstitious realm, she must rely on her own cunning and wit, especially when her husband\u2019s downfall inadvertently sets them free. Suspicious of the dark devices that may have led to his father\u2019s death, her son watches as his mother falls in love with the enigmatic thane Macbeth. Now a woman of stature, Lady Macbeth confronts a world of masculine power and secures the protection of her family. But the coronation of King Duncan and the political maneuvering of her cousin Macduff set her on a tragic course, one where her own success might mean embracing the very curse that haunts her and risking the child she loves.

This world of sea and storm runs deep with bargains and blood. On the remote isle of Rosevear, Mira, like her mother before her, is a wrecker, one of the seven on the rope who swim out to shipwrecks to plunder them. Mira's job is to rescue survivors, if there are any. After all, she never feels the cold of the frigid ocean waters and the waves seem to sing to her soul. But the people of Rosevear never admit the truth: that they set the beacons themselves to lure ships into the rocks. When the Council watch lays a trap to put an end to the wrecking, they arrest Mira's father. Desperate to save him from the noose, Mira strikes a deal with an enigmatic wreck survivor guarding layers of secrets behind his captivating eyes, and sets off to find something her mother has left her, a family secret buried deep in the sea. With just nine days to find what she needs to rescue her father, all Mira knows for certain is this: The sea gives. The sea takes. And it's up to her to do what she must to save the ones she loves. "
