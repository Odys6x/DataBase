The minute Principal Yee announces an epic competition for the golden B-B trophy, seventh-grader Frederick Douglass Zezzmer knows he has to win. But it won't be easy. The competition doesn't just include science, technology, engineering and math. It also has arts and sports. Not Doug's best subjects. Even worse, it's a TEAM competition. Instead of being in a superstar group, Doug gets paired with four middle school misfits no one else wants. Worst of all, Doug's dad has a horrible backup plan. If Doug doesn't win, he has to forget about becoming The World's Greatest Inventor and spend the summerin sports camp, with his scary stepbrother. "

Under the cover of night, twelve-year-old Homer flees Southerland Plantation with his little sister Ada, unwillingly leaving their beloved mother behind. Much as he adores her and fears for her life, Homer knows there's no turning back, not with the overseer on their trail. Through tangled vines, secret doorways, and over a sky bridge, the two find a secret community called Freewater, deep in the swamp. In this society created by formerly enslaved people and some freeborn children, Homer finds new friends, almost forgetting where he came from. But when he learns of a threat that could destroy Freewater, he crafts a plan to find his mother and help his new home. Deeply inspiring and loosely based on the history of maroon communities in the South, this is a striking tale of survival, adventure, friendship, and courage. "

But the First Lady of the United States\u2014some 80 years ago, that is\u2014 isn't a mystery for long when she starts spouting things like \"You must do the things you think you cannot do.\" Fresh off a visit from Ben Franklin, Nolan and Olive know what they're in for with this latest guest: an adventure.

Perfect for fans of Korman's Restart.    Mason and Ty were once the very best of friends, like two nerdy sides of the same coin . . . until seventh grade, when Ava Petrakis came along. Now Mason can trace everything bad in his life to that terrible fight they had over the new girl. The one thing he'd give anything for is a do-over. But that can't happen in real life\u2014can it?  As a science kid, Mason knows do-overs are impossible, so he can't believe it when he wakes up from a freak accident and finds himself magically transported back to seventh grade. His parents aren't yet divorced and his beloved sheepdog is still alive. Best of all, he and Ty haven't had their falling-out yet.  It makes no logical sense, but Mason is determined to use this second chance to not only save his friendship (and his dog!) but do other things differently\u2014like trying out for the football team and giving new friends a chance. There's just one person he'll be avoiding at all costs: Ava. But despite his best efforts, will he be able to stop the chain of events that made his previous life implode?. "

Ever since Corey Fletcher found out that he's the world's first \"throwback,\" with the power to not only visit history, but change it, he's been spending as much time in the past as possible. Corey loves using his skills to fix problems and help his friends and family. But as Corey becomes more and more addicted to rewriting history, he learns that time travel might change him in ways he may never be able to reverse.    Aware now that he can't keep going into the past forever, Corey decides to use the trips he still has to change history in the most meaningful way he can imagine: by stopping Adolf Hitler. But when Corey travels back to World War II-era Germany, he quickly learns that the forces of history are strong and that it's going to take a lot more than his good intentions to turn back the tides of evil\u2014or even to survive them.       Get ready for time-warping adventure with a historical twist in the second book of the Throwback trilogy from New York Times bestselling author Peter Lerangis, whose books have sold over five and a half million copies worldwide.

German Nazis occupy much of France. And twelve-year-old Miriam, who is Jewish, is not safe. With help and quick thinking, Miri is saved from the roundup that takes her entire Jewish neighborhood. She escapes Paris, landing in a small French village, where the spires of the famous Chateau de Chenonceau rise high into the sky, its bridge across the River Cher like a promise, a fairy tale.\u00a0 But Miri\u2019s life is no fairy tale. Her parents are gone\u2014maybe alive, maybe not. Taken in at the boarding school near the chateau, pretending to be Catholic to escape Nazi capture, Miri volunteers one night to undertake a deadly task, one that spans the castle grounds, its bridge, and the very border to freedom. Here is her chance to escape\u2014hopefully to find her parents. But will she take it? One thing is certain: The person Miri meets that night will save her life. And the person Miri becomes that night could save the lives of many more. In her return to the era of  The War that Saved My Life  and  The War I Finally Won , Kimberly Brubaker Bradley brings a new and different story, one with a mystical twist, that explores a little-known slice of World War II history, a highly unusual friendship, and the power of choosing courage even when\u2014especially when\u2014there are no good choices to be had.  * Map and detailed author's note included. *   \u201cCompelling [with] a hint of magic [that] becomes as satisfying as the whole of this fine novel.\u201d   \u2014 Booklist    \"Historical fiction at its finest.

So Matt ends up a pet sitting for his neighbor, Farmer Jed. Easy enough, right?    Wrong.      In fact, it's downright  baaaaaaad.     The \"pet\" in question is Nora, an old goat with glassy eyes and short tail. Farmer Jed says she's \"special.\" Matt's pretty sure, however, that the most impressive thing about Nora is how far her eyes can roll into the back of her head.  While trying to keep track of Nora and all her mysterious actions, Matt is  also  helping his girlfriend Grace with her Science Fair project, attending both soccer  and  Cross-Country practice, and, oh yeah, trying to avoid some scary guy named Jason who seemingly wants to enact perilous revenge on young Matt. More on  that  guy later.

By studying the Weston Farm Circles, her town's legendary crop circle phenomenon, she'll not only demonstrate the existence of extraterrestrial life, but also win the McMurray Youth Science Competition\u2014a feat she's sure will impress her distant NASA scientist father. Dani most certainly does not believe in aliens. How can she, when they go against every scientific principle she's been taught? So when Dani is paired with Cat to enter the McMurray Youth Science Competition\u2014which she has to win to avoid going to her parents' artsy summer camp\u2014she knows she's at a disadvantage. Her solution? Disprove Cat's theory, of course ... without telling her partner her true intentions. But as the girls bond over science, it becomes clear that there is something strange about the Weston Farm Circles. And when Dani and Cat's project is threatened by suspicious forces, they'll have to work together to expose the truth, once and for all. \"Crackling with wit, smarts, spunk, and surprises, this is a must-read for sciencelovers, alien-believers, and anyone who wants to get lost in a satisfying story.\"\u2014Corey Ann Haydu, author of The Widely Unknown Myth of Apple and Dorothy and One Jar of Magic.

This is the first book in the  Adventures in a Video Game  series, a new series by bestselling author, Dustin Brady, where each book contains its own adventure in a different type of thrilling video game. \u200b  Bentley Carmone's twelfth birthday party has been\u2014without question\u2014his worst. For one thing, no one wanted to come. That wouldn't be so bad if those that did come had a good time, but everyone seems to be bored stiff. Finally, (and arguably most importantly), the entire party has just been captured by video game aliens.   Now, Bentley must team up with Polly, a gas station girl mascot turned video game hero, to hunt down the aliens. Armed with a blaster and laser sword, Polly would be the perfect partner for this job if she could ever stop invading mini-golf courses and blowing up semi-trucks. Over time, Bentley learns that Polly may not only hold the key to saving his friends, but also solving a mystery that has haunted the Carmone family for years. Can Bentley get through to her before it's too late?. "

Sixth grade has been pretty disaster-free for aspiring astronaut Maple McNutt\u2014which is impressive, given the number of worries and possible catastrophes that run through her head every day. (So far, Earth hasn't been devoured by a black hole and a cockroach hasn't crawled out of her toothpaste mid-squeeze. Phew!) But then her best friend of seven-point-two years, Sunny Gwon, accuses her of being  unfun  and starts hanging around with a new group of friends.   In order to win Sunny back, Maple decides to undergo a serious scientific transformation to become fun by 1. Doing extensive research, 2. Applying research to self, and and 3. Repeating until fun. It's risky and groundbreaking research, but Maple has no choice if she wants to save her friendship. "

And one little boy is excited to work alongside his Papa as they collect eggs, plums, peppers and pumpkins to sell at their stand in the farmer's market. Of course, it's more than a farmer's market. Papa knows each customer's order, from Ms. Rosa's pumpkins to Mr. Johnny's peppers. And when Papa can't make it to the stand, his community gathers around him, with dishes made of his own produce. With lyrical text, this poignant picture book\u2014adapted for audio\u2014reveals a family's pride in their work, and reminds us to harvest love and hope from those around us. "

A touching ode to the homes\u2014and loved ones\u2014that raise us, perfect for fans of Christian Robinson, Oge Mora, and Ekua Holmes .    While her mother puts the finishing touches on her twists, a young girl asks what it means to be \"homegrown.\" Touring precious memories and lively rooms warmed by family, Mama and Granny explain that home isn't just a place, but rather a reflection of people who support and love one another.  Homegrown  is a beautiful debut audiobook that reminds us to lift up the places\u2014and people\u2014we call home.  A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt & Company. "

                "In this middle grade rom-com sprinkled with a dash of magic, a girl uses her newfound ability to make people fall in love to sabotage her rival.  Erin Johnson's thirteenth birthday unfolds like any other day, from her mom's quirky and embarrassing choice of outfit to racing her nemesis, Trevor Jin, to the best seat in class\u2014front row, center. But her gifts this year include something very out of the ordinary: magical powers.   Erin discovers her mysterious father is actually the love god Cupid and she's inherited his knack for romance. It's not the most useful ability for an overachiever with lofty academic and extracurricular goals...or is it? Erin desperately wants to be elected president of the Multicultural Leadership Club, and as usual, Trevor is her fiercest competition. He's never backed down from a challenge before, but if Erin makes him fall in love with her, maybe he'd drop out of the race and let her win.   With her magical pedigree, wrapping Trevor around her finger is a snap, and having him around all the time is a small price to pay for victory. But without their cutthroat rivalry bringing out the worst in each other, Erin realizes Trevor may not be as bad as she thought, and suddenly her first foray into love gets a lot more complicated...

                "A powerful contemporary novel about an aspiring 12 year-old filmmaker whose world is turned upside down when his grandfather is slain in a senseless and racist act of violence. From the author of the award-winning memoir,  Defiant: Growing Up in the Jim Crow South  and\u00a0co-editor of  Recognize! An Anthology Honoring and Amplifying Black Life.  \"A powerful reminder to never stop speaking the truth.\" - Kirkus Reviews   Lamar can\u2019t wait to start his filmmaking career like his idol Spike Lee.\u00a0 And leave behind his small town of Morton, Louisiana. But for now, Lamar has to learn how to be a filmmaker while getting to know his grandfather.\u00a0 When Gramps talks about his activism and Black history, Lamar doesn\u2019t think much about it. Times have changed since the old Civil Rights days! Right? He has a white friend named Jeff who wants to be a filmmaker, too, even though Jeff\u2019s parents never let him go to Lamar\u2019s Black neighborhood. But there\u2019s been progress in town. Right?
