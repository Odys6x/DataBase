                "\u201cThis wonderful book is a compass, a blueprint, a mirror, and a friend. Kohli gives language to what many of us feel but can\u2019t yet articulate.\u201d\u2014Erika L. S\u00e1nchez,  New York Times  bestselling author of  I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter   \u201cLoving, culturally informed, and holistic... [Kohli] compassionately shares her own story, and guides readers through the nuances and pain of assimilation, individuation, and mental health. How I wish I had this book back when I was trying to figure it all out for myself!\u201d \u2014Ramani Durvasula, PhD, author of  It\u2019s Not You  A deeply personal, paradigm-shifting book rethinking traditional therapy and self-care, creating much-needed space for those left out of the narrative  Writer and therapist Sahaj Kaur Kohli grew up knowing exactly what it means to straddle multiple cultures at once. Like many children of immigrants, she has often found herself plagued by questions: Can I establish my own values  and  embrace where I come from? Is prioritizing my mental health really rejecting my culture? How do I set boundaries and care for myself when family and community mean everything? Even after becoming a therapist herself, she saw those same gaps in the mental health world, leading her to wonder, like so many children of immigrants: what about us? While conversations around mental health are becoming increasingly open, our models remain largely Eurocentric and focused on individuality. Sahaj has sought to challenge these long-held models, using deep personal reflection, therapy, community building, and a whole lot of trial and error, eventually navigating her own way to understanding and acceptance. Here, she shows us how to get there, all the while reminding us that personal healing is inextricably connected to collective healing.  But What Will People Say?  elegantly weaves together personal narrative, anecdotal analysis, and comprehensive research. Sahaj offers advice and tools for everything from navigating generational trauma, guilt, and boundaries, to breaking down stigmas around therapy and celebrating cultural duality. Democratizing and decolonizing the way we think about mental health and self-help, Sahaj\u2019s incredible work is nothing short of a revolution.  *Includes a downloadable PDF of\u00a0tables and exercises from the book.

Instead, those books give you more to do and don't provide what you're looking for. They require you to use your mind when the key to finding inner peace, self-love, happiness, and fulfillment lies in connecting to the soul. How to Trust Your Inner Voice doesn't offer routines to add to your already busy schedule. Instead, it offers a simple and accessible explanation for how our mind blocks us from accessing our own personal GPS system, the soul. The soul knows what to do, always. But the events and conditioning from our childhood, the dominant values of our culture, and our habitual thought patterns pull us away, creating depression and anxiety and making it hard for us to hear our inner guidance. You don't have to live this way! Written for anyone who is struggling with confusion, depression, anxiety, or general unhappiness in life, How to Trust Your Inner Voice will empower and guide you to quickly and easily renew your natural connection to your true self and your inner guidance anytime and anywhere so that you can live in the state of peace and happiness that is your birthright.

Are you running on empty? Is it hard to pinpoint what's wrong? This is an experience millions of us are struggling with, and until now, we've lacked the vocabulary to understand it. But Dr Corey Keyes has identified this feeling as  languishing , and here he draws on the latest research and real-life case studies to trace its spread to a level of global epidemic, asking the fundamental question of how we find lasting wellbeing. Breaking down the science of emotional exhaustion, Keyes shows that our very obsession with happiness complicates the process of finding it. Only by shifting our focus from  feeling good  to  functioning well  can we unlock the key to flourishing. He reveals the choices and mental habits that inadvertently worsen the problem, and shares simple but powerful steps anyone can take to restore meaning, joy, and calm to their lives.   Languishing  is a must-read for anyone tempted to downplay the feelings of demotivation and emptiness they've been experiencing, to help them find true flourishing in our short time on earth.  \u00a92024 Corey Keyes (P)2024 Penguin Audio.

A Harvard-trained doctor draws on narrative therapy and her own multiple sclerosis diagnosis to offer chronic illness patients a way through anxiety, confusion, and trauma.   When Harvard-trained physician Dr. Annie Brewster was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2001, she realized firsthand that the medical system to which she\u2019d devoted her entire career was failing patients. The experience was dehumanizing. Her doctors weren\u2019t listening. And the confusion, fear, and shame she felt around her diagnosis was preventing her from truly healing, claiming her story, and living her fullest, richest life.  \u00a0  Here, Dr. Brewster and journalist Rachel Zimmerman each share their own personal stories, acting as expert guides as you move forward on your healing journey. With exercises, reflections, writing prompts, and stories from other real patients, Dr. Brewster and Zimmerman show how you can:  \u2022 Process the difficult emotions that come with life-changing diagnosis  \u2022\u00a0Move beyond being the hero of your own story to become the author of your own story  \u2022\u00a0Craft your narrative and share it in whatever medium speaks to you  \u2022\u00a0Integrate a traumatic health event into a new and evolving identity  \u2022\u00a0Use applied storytelling techniques to strengthen connections with loved ones and care providers  \u2022\u00a0Cultivate resilience to move forward amid uncertainty and fear  \u00a0  The fact is, doctors can give you a life-changing diagnosis, but they\u2019re not equipped to help you deal with the inner fallout: the confusion, anxiety, trauma, and dread that comes after \u201cI have some bad news.\u201d Dr. Brewster shows how writing your own unique healing story can help you process what comes next\u2014to come to terms, create new ways to thrive, and even reclaim your personal power amid fear, change, and uncertainty.

One of the pioneers of the use of an intense form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in severely depressed patients, Dr. Carreon was astonished by how quickly and dramatically most of them recovered. But he also saw very clearly that just eliminating the symptoms of depression wasn't enough. To live a truly fulfilling life, his patients needed to leave old habits behind and embrace the patterns of flourishing. In The Opposite of Depression, he draws on insights from his clinical experience, the latest research, and his Christian faith to point listeners to principles and practices that promote thriving in mind, body, and soul. Each chapter offers practical steps listeners can take to start moving in the direction of greater satisfaction, fulfillment, and purpose. "

Written with warmth and humor,  Underestimated  is the first book to invite us into a teenage girl's brain and heart, as told from the point of view of a beloved and trusted mentor. Chelsey Goodan is a highly sought-after academic tutor who has worked with hundreds of girls from all different backgrounds, earning their trust, confidence, and friendship. They in turn have shared with her their innermost concerns, doubts, and what they wish they could communicate to their parents and the world at large.   With topics and language directly chosen by the girls, Goodan reveals how the solutions to a girl's well-being lie within her. She offers parents the exact words they can use to help her discover these solutions and demonstrates how adults can better support a teenage girl's voice to create positive change.   Rather than dismissing teenage girls based on our own fears or treating them as problems that need to be solved, Goodan encourages us as parents, and as a society, to help girls unleash their power and celebrate their intrinsic wisdom, creating more healing and connection for everyone. With inspiring ease,  Underestimated  shows us how to do this with accessible advice, entertaining narratives, and profound wisdom. "

If you commit to self-care but find yourself exhausted, unhappy, or anxious, do you wonder what's missing? The fact is, we are all navigating an exhausting, disconnecting, do-more-buy-more culture that disproportionately harms those with marginalized identities and leads us to believe that our thriving depends solely on individual effort. Mainstream wellness culture doesn't account for the ways that social oppression and economic injustice intersect to make resilience diffi cult for many of us to access in the first place. So, where do we begin?  In this warm and accessible guide, Pakistani American therapist Anjuli Sherin provides a healing path to make thriving possible for everyone. Through compelling client stories and reflective exercises, she offers a culturally informed, body -centered model that shows us how cultivating self-nurturance, healthy boundaries, pleasure, and a soulful connection to the natural world can give us the generative energy needed to heal individual and collective trauma and shape our world from an inner magic called  joyous resilience .

In this brilliant guide he presents hands-on techniques for managing stress by rewiring our brains to approach potentially difficult situations through a lens of positivity. To do so, Dr. King explores what stress is, where it comes from, and what it does to our bodies and brains. He delves deep into how to address everyday stress-as well as anxiety, insecurities, repression, and negativity-and gives insight into resulting ailments such as anxiety disorders, depression, hypertension, obesity, substance abuse disorders, and more. Dr. King's techniques are chemical and cost free, and embrace humor, resilience, relaxation, optimism, gratitude, and acceptance. Instead of a dry medical approach to dealing with stress, this unique volume is filled with life-changing tips and instructions presented with humor and a wealth of memorable, smile-inducing anecdotes.

                "Many people who've experienced trauma tend to blame themselves. This tendency to self-blame often begins in childhood and is carried into adulthood and can manifest in a number of emotional and behavioral problems. You've probably tried to quiet your critical inner voice through avoidance and distraction, only to have the negative self-talk return time and time again to sabotage your self-esteem and interfere with your life. Fortunately, you possess the power to forgive yourself and discover your inner strength. With this workbook, you'll learn proven-effective skills that integrate self-forgiveness with acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), compassion-focused therapy (CFT), functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP), and relational frame theory (RFT). You'll develop the self-compassion and self-acceptance needed to overcome the sense of shame and guilt that's keeping you from a meaningful life. You'll also gain a new perspective on your life's story, empowering you to get in touch with your values and make an ongoing commitment to self-forgiveness. Forgiving yourself does not mean the pain of the past will go away forever, but it can reduce the burden you've placed on yourself. If you're ready to replace self-blame with self-empowerment and self-reliance, this book will be your guide on a journey toward healing and joy. "

Most of us were never taught how to effectively express our preferences, desires or deal-breakers. Instead, we hide our feelings behind passive-aggressive behavior, deny our own truths, or push our emotions down until we get depressed or so frustrated that we explode, potentially destroying hard-won trust and relationships.  The most successful and satisfied people on the planet have one thing in common: the ability to create and communicate clear, healthy boundaries. This ability is, hands down, the biggest game changer when it comes to creating a healthy, happy, self-determined life.  In  Boundary Boss , psychotherapist Terri Cole reveals a specific set of skills that can help you stop abandoning yourself for the sake of others (without guilt or drama) and get empowered to consciously take control of every aspect of your emotional, spiritual, physical, personal, and professional life.  Since becoming a Boundary Boss is a process, Cole also offers actionable strategies, scripts, and techniques that can be used in the moment, whenever you need them. You will learn:    How to recognize when your boundaries have been violated and what to do next    How your unique \"Boundary Blueprint\" is unconsciously driving your boundary behaviors, and strategies to redesign it    Powerful boundary scripts so in the moment you will know what to say    How to manage \"Boundary Destroyers\"\u2014including emotional manipulators, narcissists, and other toxic personalities    Where you fall on the spectrum of codependency and how to create healthy, balanced relationships   This book is for women who are exhausted from over-giving, overdoing, and even over-feeling. If you're getting it all done but at the expense of yourself, give yourself the gift of    Boundary Boss. "

                "Philosopher Myisha Cherry teaches us the right ways to deal with wrongdoing in our lives and the world Sages from Cicero to Oprah have told us that forgiveness requires us to let go of negative emotions and that it has a unique power to heal our wounds. In Failures of Forgiveness, Myisha Cherry argues that these beliefs couldn't be more wrong\u2014and that the ways we think about and use forgiveness, personally and as a society, can often do more harm than good. She presents a new and healthier understanding of forgiveness\u2014one that will give us a better chance to recover from wrongdoing and move toward \"radical repair.\" Cherry began exploring forgiveness after some relatives of the victims of the mass shooting at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, forgave what seemed unforgiveable. She was troubled that many observers appeared to be more inspired by these acts of forgiveness than they were motivated to confront the racial hatred that led to the killings. That is a big mistake, Cherry argues. Forgiveness isn't magic. We can forgive and still be angry, there can be good reasons not to forgive, and forgiving a wrong without tackling its roots solves nothing. Examining how forgiveness can go wrong in families, between friends, at work, and in the media, politics, and beyond, Cherry addresses forgiveness and race, cancelling versus forgiving, self-forgiveness, and more. She takes the burden of forgiveness off those who have been wronged and offers guidance both tothose deciding whether and how to forgive and those seeking forgiveness. By showing us how to do forgiveness better, Failures of Forgiveness promises to transform how we deal with wrongdoing in our lives, opening a new path to true healing and reconciliation. "

How do you enjoy a holiday without obsessing over your inbox?    Should you accept your colleague's request to follow you on Instagram?   The modern workplace can be an emotional minefield, filled with confusing power structures and unwritten rules. We're expected to be authentic but not too authentic. Professional but not stiff. Friendly but not an oversharer.  As organizational consultants and regular people, we know what it's like to experience uncomfortable emotions at work - everything from mild jealousy and insecurity to panic and rage. Ignoring or suppressing what you feel hurts your health and productivity but so does letting your emotions run wild.  In this book we'll help you figure out which emotions to toss, which to keep to yourself, and which to express in order to be both happier and more effective. We'll share the latest research and helpful tips, and reveal the surprising reason why you'll actually be more healthier and focused if you're less passionate about your job.  Drawing on what we've learned from behavioural economics, psychology and our own experiences at countless organizations, we'll show you how to bring your best self (and your whole self) to work every day.

Modern life can feel like an endless sequence of cancelled plans, last-minute meetings and delayed journeys. So how can we use unpredictability to our advantage? LSE and NYU academic Dr Christian Busch has spent a decade exploring how, if acted upon, unexpected encounters can enhance our worldview, expand our social circles and create new professional opportunities. In this book, he reveals the secrets behind the hidden force that rules the universe: serendipity. From social mobility in Sub-Saharan Africa to accidental energy-saving multinationals in the West, he has studied hundreds of subjects internationally who improved their lives by learning to see opportunities in the unexpected. We meet people from all backgrounds, from couples who first interacted during chance encounters to businesspeople who invented multi-million ideas after a best-laid plan misfired, learning the fundamental common denominators among lucky people.  The Serendipity Mindset  is a revolutionary exploration of a well-researched and essential life skill that we can all develop in a few simple steps. By learning to identify, act on and share it, we can use uncertainty as a pathway to more joyful, purposeful and successful lives.  \u00a9 Dr Christian Busch 2020 (P) Penguin Audio 2020. "

Is it possible to have hundreds of followers on social media but still feel isolated? To live in a city of millions of people but find yourself alone? No one really wants to admit it, but the answer is certainly 'yes'. So, let's talk about loneliness. Human connection specialist Simone Heng knows a lot about being lonely. She left an enviable career and social life to move back to her family home to care for her mother. All alone in a house filled with memories but devoid of people, she was faced with the realization that human connection is one of our most essential needs. There's a global loneliness epidemic. Every one of us has experienced feeling lonely, even if we don't realize it. The modern world has changed how we live and the 'village' environment with spontaneous connection has been replaced by remote work and contrived relationships. Most importantly, the old stereotypes of what loneliness looks like no longer hold true \u2014 in a world where technology has made us more 'connected' than ever before, people of all ages are feeling alone. Simone shares her journey to understanding the value of human connection and explains how to distinguish authentic relationships from fake substitutes. This definitive audiobook on loneliness shows us how to build meaningful relationships with those that matter the most, forge new friendships, and create the genuine connections we all crave. "

Or do you try to pretend that you're really not angry at all and just hope the feelings will go away? Most of us express anger in more than one way, but we also tend to be creatures of habit, falling back on a few predictable styles when we feel angry. Unfortunately, while some styles are appropriate in some situations, others are not-and consistently using an inappropriate style is a sure way to find yourself saddled with a huge anger problem. This book examines the eleven most common styles of anger expression and helps you learn how to communicate your anger in healthy ways. Learn which anger styles work for different situations-and which ones lead to certain disaster. Find out how to become more flexible and creative at expressing your anger. Once you understand the whole range of anger styles, you'll be able to better manage angry feelings and use your anger as a positive force for building a better life. "

You'll also discover powerful strategies to help you give voice to your unmet needs; and learn to cultivate clarity, security, and confidence in yourself and what you need.

                "An inspirational collection of letters, notes, and conversations among friends, celebrities, experts, and the September Letters community. A guide to help us clearly see that we are not alone, and that sharing your story is powerful and healing.   When actress and activist Brittany Snow was a teenager, she read an article about another woman's hardship that made her feel seen and less alone. She carried that story in her back pocket for a long time. This experience was a gift that Brittany then paid forward when she revealed her own experience in a published article. Brittany's story resonated with a young reader, who kept that story in her back pocket, where it was when the two crossed paths serendipitously.  In   September Letters, Brittany Snow and close friend and SL cofounder Jaspre Guest show us how sharing our stories reveals our greater connection. This book features a collection of original letters and notes from Hannah Bronfman, Lily Cornell Silver, Kid Cudi, Maria Menounos, and more, alongside interviews with mental health experts like David Kessler, Gretchen Rubin, Mark Epstein, Jay Shetty, and Wendy Suzuki.  Equal parts guide and resource, September Letters is for anyone seeking to feel more connected with themselves and others.      Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Drawing on the distinguished author's lifetime of accumulated insights and experience, Awaken guides listeners on a journey to achieve complete alignment between who they are, what they say, what they do, and how they relate to others. By healing our traumas, uniting the polarities in our lives, and connecting to our deepest purpose, we can attain personal power and amplify our positive impact on the world. Most people have chosen not to deal with their trauma; they conceal it, numb it, and relive it. Awaken shows us how to mine the ups and downs of our lives to experience \"post-traumatic growth.\" Written for anyone with even a passing interest in improving their inner life and making a difference in the world, Awaken provides proven tools and practical advice that allow listeners to know themselves, love themselves, be themselves, and express themselves. Listeners will learn how to grow their personal power by building self-trust, cultivating presence, drawing healthy boundaries, leaning into necessary conflict, and challenging orthodoxies. Awaken will help listeners see their lives differently to transform their experience of living. "

As there have been increases in violence against women, people of color, immigrants, and LGBTQI-identified people, there has been a corresponding demand for individual and community self-defense, boundary setting, and bystander trainings. Boundary setting can be used not just as a means for personal safety but as form of solidarity, resistance, and inspiration.  From saying no to a boss who always asks you to work late, to setting a boundary with a loved one, to navigating an uncomfortable situation at the bus stop, Cristien Storm offers a new approach to verbal boundary setting that is accessible for all bodies and identities. Practical in scope, the book includes tools, tips, and strategies from Storm's decades of experience leading boundary-setting workshops. Grounded in resiliency and trauma-informed theory, Storm pays particular attention to the experiences of women, people of color, immigrants, and LQBTQI-identified people, making this necessary reading for anyone looking to create healthier relationships and build stronger communities.

There is so much that worries us across our days and nights: whether our hopes will come true, whether others will like us, whether the people we care about will be OK, whether we can escape humiliation and grief...   Too often, we bottle up our anxieties or try to avoid looking at them directly. We are ashamed of how worried we are and end up feeling isolated and yet more worried. None of this is necessary. Anxiety is deeply normal and, like so much else that troubles our minds, it can be understood and brought under our control. We all deserve to wake up every day without a sense of foreboding.   This is a guide to anxiety: why we feel it, how we experience it when it strikes, and what we can do when we come under its influence. Across a series of essays that look at the subject from a number of angles, the tone is helpful, compassionate, and in the best sense practical. "

Michael Rosen has grieved the loss of a child, lived with debilitating chronic illness, and faced death itself when seriously unwell in hospital. In spite of this he has survived, and has even learned to find joy in life in the aftermath of tragedy. In  Getting Better , he shares his story and the lessons he has learned along the way. Exploring the roles that trauma and grief have played in his own life, Michael investigates the road to recovery, asking how we can find it within ourselves to live well again after - or even during - the darkest times of our lives. Moving and insightful,  Getting Better  is an essential companion for anyone who has loved and lost, or struggled and survived. \u00a92023 Michael Rosen (P)2023 Penguin Audio. "

                "Life is an unpredictable white-water ride of fast currents, beautiful scenery, rocky passageways, and calm waters. What Does It Matter? is a simple yet profound framework to be used when deciding priorities, curating possessions, making plans, and managing emotions. In this life-affirming book, the author shares what she has found undeniably helpful in her own life and offers it to you, the listener, to use in yours-however you want to. And the \"however you want to\" bit is crucial, because the best lesson you can take away from this book is to remember to think before you follow. Remember to think before you overreact. Remember to think before being so hard on yourself. Remember to ask, \"What does it matter?\" to help you see the funny side in any situation sooner. You are in charge of yourself; your life is yours. You can think for yourself-don't let anyone tell you that you can't. Happiness propaganda may imply that you are not enough or your life is sub-standard, but this book will serve as a direct torpedo hit against that commonplace assault. Use this book as part of your protection plan against self-destruction . . . and then use it to help others. Live life with less stress and more joy by asking yourself: \"What does it matter?\" (WDIM)-and have the courage to act on your answer. "

What would happen if a shy introvert lived like a gregarious extrovert for one year? If she knowingly and willingly put herself in perilous social situations that she'd normally avoid at all costs? Jessica Pan is going to find out.  When she found herself jobless and friendless, sitting in the familiar Jess-shaped crease on her sofa, she couldn't help but wonder what life might have looked like if she had been a little more open to new experiences and new people, a little less attached to going home instead of going to the pub. So, she made a vow: to push herself to live the life of an extrovert for a year. She wrote a list: improv, a solo holiday and... talking to strangers on the tube. She regretted it instantly.   Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come  follows Jess's hilarious and painful year of misadventures in extroverting, reporting back from the frontlines for all the introverts out there.  But is life actually better or easier for the extroverts? Or is it the nightmare Jess always thought it would be?. "

                "An inspirational guide to the 6 core qualities of healthy communities, for anyone looking to build community as a source of connection and a vehicle for social change  After two years meeting with different communities in the US, psychologist Lisa Kentgen identified 6 key traits of vibrant, healthy communities that we can all apply to our own lives and networks:  Commitment to care  Acceptance  Diversity  Skillful conflict resolution  Bonding rituals  Hospitality  Each chapter focuses on one of these traits, highlighting a particular community as a case study of how it can be put into practice. You\u2019ll learn about a wide range of successful community models, including a tiny-home village for people who had been chronically houseless in Austin, Texas; a study circle to build connection between Native and non-Native people in a small town in South Dakota; a 500-member community choir in Columbus, Ohio; and a Buddhist center in Barre, Massachusetts committed to bringing greater diversity to the Dharma. Throughout the book, you\u2019ll reflect: How can we cultivate these traits of vibrant community in our own lives? What would it look like to prioritize caring and acceptance in our interactions with others? How can we create a climate of true inclusivity, one where our differences both challenge and strengthen us? How can we learn to feel more comfortable with tension and acquire the skills to move through conflict toward creative solutions? What would happen if we incorporated meaningful rituals into our communities and made a point of celebrating each other?\u00a0 With intention and practice, we can transform our social relationships and build communities that appreciate difference, encourage authentic expression, and foster an environment of belonging and mutual care. This book will inspire you to make the transformative leap from \u201cme\u201d to \u201cwe,\u201d creating communal, loving spaces in which to connect\u2014and thrive\u2014together. "

In each chapter, Rose draws from her personal experience as a teacher and facilitator of creative mindfulness to share stories and examples that help ground exercises like sketching, creative writing prompts, and more. Rose carefully walks through the process each time, explaining how to set intention and arrive in the present moment before embarking on your mindful art session; how to use objects and thoughts as creative prompts; how to return your attention to your work as you move forward; and how to distill the wisdom you have found in the process.\u00a0 For seasoned artists, creative mindfulness offers a chance to slow down and rediscover the transformative power that art can offer when it is detached from the need to produce something beautiful or useful. For those coming to expressive arts with existing mindfulness practices or engaged in a therapeutic process, a mindful arts practice may reveal a passion for creation you didn\u2019t know existed. And for everyone, creative mindfulness can help us make sense of our feelings and find new ways of expressing ourselves\u2014in art and in life. "

Anxiety, they might add, is \"freaking out,\" a panic attack, or a frightening loss of control. But anxiety isn't always what we think it is, especially now. Anxiety has become the new normal, constant and simmering, disguising itself in patterns and responses we don't even recognize as anxiety. These patterns include: - Ruminating and worrying (and mistaking it for problem solving) - Going global, or seeing the world through an overwhelming, all-or-nothing lens - Isolating and disconnecting, all too common in our \"new normal\" - Creating chaos and \"busy-ness\" The Anxiety Audit is a guide for us all: with no overly scientific or diagnostic language-just real talk and time-tested tactics from a respected therapist-it is a relatable and practical guide to untangling yourself from the grips of worry and fear. Using stories, real-world examples, and helpful dialogues to retrain the way you think and react, trusted anxiety expert Lynn Lyons helps you recognize the sneaky ways these anxious patterns and cycles of worry take hold in your life.

                "Drawing upon his twenty-five years as a holistic psychotherapist, John Ruskan presents a brilliant self-therapy system for complete inner healing and well-being. Based on a unique synthesis of Eastern meditation-mindfulness principles and Western humanistic psychological insights, the DEEP CLEARING program will empower you with a feeling-based, holistic, inner process that will clear the subconscious, restore and maintain emotional balance, overcome inner and outer negativity, and spontaneously shift you into authentic unconditional joyfulness and Higher Consciousness. The book takes you through a series of consciousness shifts that gives you a new radical outlook and tools for emotional self-healing. It shows you how to use emotional pain as a means to heal and evolve yourself instead of merely being battered by it and stuffing it into the subconscious. As you learn how to release trapped subconscious emotional pain and trauma, your world experience effortlessly changes for the better. The DEEP CLEARING process trains you in how to apply the enlightened spiritual principles of acceptance, presence, and witnessing to negative states, thereby allowing them to integrate and naturally resolve themselves. You will learn how to relax and accept yourself deeply, calming the critical, self-blaming mind. "

                "Self-talk matters, but what methods of building healthy self-talk actually work? This how-to guide shares evidence-based techniques to go from being your own worst critic to your own best friend.  Perhaps you want to be nicer to yourself but don't really know how to get there. Or maybe you're someone who assumes self-criticism is a permanent part of your personality. Rest assured you're not alone. Millions of people struggle with the toll that excessive self-criticism takes on their minds, energy levels, jobs, and relationships. And problems with self-talk vary dramatically from one person to the next: they can appear as mild but persistent inner criticism, full-blown self-loathing, or the pain of internalized oppression or abuse.   After over twenty years of working with individuals, groups, and classes on self-criticism and related challenges, psychologist and mindfulness teacher Dr. Rachel Goldsmith Turow offers the \"self-talk workout\"\u2014six doable exercises that can help you replace self-criticism with self-kindness and self-encouragement.  Specific self-talk strategies such as \"Spot the success,\" \"Fail forward,\" and \"Allowing all feelings, skillfully,\" require just a few minutes a day. These skills can be practiced individually to transform your self-talk, or you can choose to combine two or more exercises to enhance your self-talk workout. Each chapter features a core exercise, variations on the strategy that might feel right for you, scientific studies supporting each approach, and success stories to inspire your own practice.  Turow includes examples from her own life and experiences as a psychotherapist, as well as lessons from her students and respected public figures such as Michelle Obama and Thich Nhat Hanh, to show that the burden of harsh self-criticism need not go on forever: the way that we relate to ourselves can be changed.

Excerpts from interviews with 50 parents who lost a child from five to forty-five trace the road from utter devastation to a revised view of life, resulting in a work that is a tribute to resilience and the indomitable human spirit.  Author Judith R. Bernstein, Ph.D., speaks from the dual perspectives of bereaved parent and psychologist. She weaves keen psychological insight with the voices of parents to achieve an intelligent volume that is at once heartbreaking and heartwarming. The wisdom of her science and her heart combine to result in a book that teaches the psychology of bereavement with profound tenderness. "

                "It's time to end your addiction to sugar. Before each binge comes a hollow feeling, like an invisible hand that pushes you to seek sugar. It manifests when you're stressed, bored, anxious. Addiction makes you the tennis ball in a match between self-loathing and depression. Every binge leads to self-loathing, the self-loathing leads to depression which in turn leads to more binging. It's time to break that cycle. As a former USA boxing coach and current certified CrossFit trainer with twenty years experience in the fitness industry and an equal amount of time spent battling sugar addiction, I'll share discoveries from my own experience. The Sugar Demons covers my entire journey from realizing I have an addiction, to the \"Ah-ha!\" moments that put me back in control of my life. Listeners will learn: the key breakthrough that gave me the edge I needed in my battle with addiction; my step-by-step plan for breaking sugar addiction; how I reduce cravings until they are silent; why \"discipline\" and \"willpower\" are ineffective strategies; a list of supplements to \"hack\" your body out of its dependence on sugar; meal prep advice; and how to control your food environment so it doesn't control you.

But what do you do when you face the big decisions of life\u2014the \"wild problems\" of who to marry, whether to have children, where to move, how to forge a life well-lived\u2014that can\u2019t be solved by measurement or calculation?  In  Wild Problems , beloved host of EconTalk Russ Roberts offers puzzled rationalists a way to address these wild problems. He suggests spending less time and energy on the path that promises the most happiness, and more time on figuring out who you actually want to be. He draws on the experience of great artists, writers, and scientists of the past who found creative ways to navigate life\u2019s biggest questions.\u00a0And he lays out strategies for reducing the fear and the loss of control that inevitably come when a wild problem requires a leap in the dark.    Ultimately, Roberts asks us to see ourselves and our lives less as a problem to be solved than a mystery to be experienced. There's no right decision waiting to be uncovered by an app or rational analysis. Reality is harder than that and, perhaps, a little more interesting. "

Many of us suffer from depression and anxiety, which impede our choices and quality of life, and despite the proliferation of prescription drugs, the numbers are growing across the globe. But there is another, proven way to achieve mental wellness, beyond antidepressants and talk therapy. Practicing psychiatrist Gregory Scott Brown believes that mental health begins with actionable self-care.  The Self-Healing Mind is a holistic approach to emotional and psychological healing that focuses on how evidence-based self-care strategies can be used to improve and sustain mental health. Dr. Brown challenges the current state of mental health care and the messaging around it, showing us how to move past outdated notions of \"broken\" brains and chemical imbalances. While he agrees that prescription drugs and talk therapy in many cases are important for healing, his personal and professional experience has taught him that lifestyle interventions are also key to sustainable mental wellness.  Dr. Brown's clinical philosophy supports an integrative approach that combines conventional treatments (medication and psychotherapy) with what he calls the Five Pillars of Self-Care: breathing mindfully, sleep, spirituality, nutrition, and movement. These purposeful lifestyle practices, backed by science and proven in his clinical practice, can be adopted by everyone. Dr. Brown's advice and insight put the power of healing back in your control.

                "With this life-changing companion workbook to I Am Here, entrepreneur, social media influencer, and author Ashley LeMieux guides you from pain to clarity and healing and inspires and empowers you to chart a course to the future you deserve.   The intense pressures of modern life have left too many of us feeing trapped or hopeless in our daily lives, and seemingly without a way forward. In this invaluable workbook, Ashley LeMieux teaches you how to use the insights she introduced in I Am Here to get yourself unstuck. Following her guidance, you will learn how to use the incredible tool she calls \"Clarity Mapping\" to define your own priorities and create a plan to get you moving toward your dreams.  Clarity Mapping brings meaningful change and inspiration to your daily life, helping you align yourself to your true purpose by focusing on five simple yet profound questions:   What is my intention?  Why am I worthy?  Who can I serve?  What can I set down?  Who is the truest version of myself today?  Ashley shows you how to establish a morning practice that will keep you accountable to the change you want to see in yourself and your world. Daily mantras such as, \"I have permission to love myself\" and \"I am full of goodness and courage,\" allow you to reframe your reality to align with your true values. Journal prompts like \"How would forgiveness set you free?\" and \"What does love feel like?\" lead you to discover your deepest truths. Combined with Ashley's wisdom, these nourishing daily practices are the foundation that will allow you to unlock your inner power and guide you on your journey of growth.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

This unique workbook takes on the seven emotions that plague problem eaters-guilt, shame, helplessness, anxiety, disappointment, confusion, and loneliness-and shows them how to embrace and learn from their feelings. Written with honesty and humor, the book explains how to identify and label a specific emotion, the function of that emotion, and why the emotion drives food and eating problems. Each chapter has two sets of exercises: experiential exercises that relate to emotions and eating, and questionnaires that provoke thinking about and understanding feelings and their purpose. Supplemental pages help identify emotions and chart emotional development. The final part of the workbook focuses on strategies for disconnecting feeling from food, discovering emotional triggers, and using one's feelings to get what one wants out of life. "

Demonstrating a powerful paradigm shift for finding solutions, Herman teaches us to see things differently, using art to challenge our default thinking and open up possibilities otherwise overlooked. Her unexpected, insightful, and often delightful methodology is sought after by leaders and professionals for whom failure is catastrophic. Luckily for us, these tactics work-no matter the problem's scale or complexity. And we don't need an art degree or previous knowledge about art to benefit from her approach, only a willingness to open our eyes and our minds. Yes, things go wrong all the time. What matters most is what we do to fix them. "

In the aftermath of stress, disappointment, and trauma, people often fall into survival mode, even while a part of them longs for more. Juggling multiple demands and responsibilities keeps them busy, but not healed. As a survivor of sexual assault, racism, and evacuation from a civil war in Liberia, Dr. Thema Bryant knows intimately the work involved in healing. Having made the journey herself, in addition to guiding others as a clinical psychologist and ordained minister, Dr. Thema shows you how to reconnect with your authentic self and reclaim your time, your voice, your life.    Signs of disconnection from self can take many forms, including people-pleasing, depression, anxiety, and resentment. Healing starts with recognizing and expressing emotions in an honest way and reconnecting with the neglected parts of yourself, but it can\u2019t be done in a vacuum. Dr. Thema gives you the tools to meaningfully connect with your larger community, even if you face racism and sexism, heartbreak, grief, and trauma. Rather than shrinking in the face of life\u2019s difficulties, you will discover in  Homecoming  the therapeutic approaches and spiritual practices to live a more expansive life characterized by empowerment, healthier relationships, gratitude, and a deeper sense of purpose.

While conventional medicine tends to view anxiety as a \"neck-up\" problem\u2014that is, one of brain chemistry and psychology\u2014the truth is that the origins of anxiety are rooted in the body.  In The Anatomy of Anxiety, holistic psychiatrist Dr. Ellen Vora offers nothing less than a paradigm shift in our understanding of anxiety and mental health, suggesting that anxiety is not simply a brain disorder but a whole-body condition. In her clinical work, Dr. Vora has found time and again that the symptoms of anxiety can often be traced to imbalances in the body. The emotional and physical discomfort we experience\u2014sleeplessness, brain fog, stomach pain, jitters\u2014is a result of the body's stress response. This physiological state can be triggered by challenging experiences as well as seemingly innocuous factors, such as diet and use of technology.  The good news is that this body-based anxiety, or, as Dr. Vora terms it, \"false anxiety,\" is easily treated. Once the body's needs are addressed, Dr. Vora reframes any remaining symptoms not as a disorder but rather as an urgent plea from within. This \"true anxiety\" is a signal that something else is out of balance\u2014in our lives, in our relationships, in the world. True anxiety serves as our inner compass, helping us recalibrate when we're feeling lost.  Practical, informative, and deeply hopeful, The Anatomy of Anxiety is the first book to fully explain the origins of anxiety and offer a detailed road map for healing and growth. "

                "An enlightening guide to success, fulfillment, wholeness, and plenty, offering\u00a0practical advice on how to cultivate a sense of abundance in times of fear and insecurity, from  New York Time s bestselling author Deepak Chopra    \u201cTo attain wealth of the lasting kind, the kind that gives your life meaning, value, and sustenance, base your daily existence on the generosity of spirit.\u201d\u2014Deepak Chopra   Many of us live and operate from a mind-set of lack, scarcity, and limitation. We focus on what we don\u2019t have\u2014financial security, confidence, an intimate relationship\u2014which keeps us feeling insecure and inadequate. We think \u201cif only I could have those things, I could be happy.\u201d But measuring wealth by money or material possessions leaves us feeling drained and spiritually empty. Constantly striving for  more  often means our ego is driving our thoughts, actions, and reactions, which prevents us from reaching something greater: a true sense of inner peace, acceptance, and fulfillment. \u00a0 Yet, there is an inner path to prosperity and wealth that, once charted and explored, provides access to the great riches of the universe and life\u2019s unbounded possibilities.  In  Abundance , international bestselling author Deepak Chopra illuminates this road to success and wholeness, helping readers tap into a deeper sense of awareness to become agents of change in their own lives. Mixing ancient teachings and spiritual practices with the wisdom he\u2019s garnered over four decades as the leading figure in mind-body medicine, Deepak demonstrates how to transcend self-generated feelings of limitation and fear in order to experience true abundance in all aspects of life. To do so, he offers a seven-step plan along with meditations and mindfulness techniques to help you focus and direct your attention, energy, and intuition so you can experience stability, affluence, insight, creativity, love, and true power.   *Includes a downloadable PDF of\u00a0surveys and quizzes from the book.

                "Identify, understand, and reframe your life story with this essential guide for self-acceptance from Lisa Olivera, a therapist, writer, and creator of a wildly popular Instagram account.  When Lisa Olivera was just a few hours old, her birth mother abandoned her behind a rock near Muir Woods in Northern California. She was found and later adopted.   Growing up, Lisa knew she was adopted. She later learned she was abandoned. Like with many adopted children, this led Lisa to wonder: why did her mother leave her behind? Without answers, Lisa came up with her own: something must be wrong with her. Lisa came to believe she was not enough. This story wasn't true, but it made sense of a confusing experience. It allowed her to move forward. It felt like the only way. Until, with the help of a therapist, Lisa began to tell herself a better story.   If you have ever felt like you didn't belong, or like you weren't worthy, or like you weren't enough, just as you are...it might be time for you to rewrite your story, too. Now a therapist herself, Lisa shows you how.   In  Already Enough , Lisa explores how our stories affect us\u2014often much more than we realize. She guides us through reframing our stories so we can remember that we are already enough, just as we are. And she invites us to join her on a transformative journey to healing. Tender, hopeful, and inspiring,  Already Enough  is a powerful reminder that we are the authors of our own stories. The sooner we decide to write a better story, the sooner we can live a more whole, more meaningful, more nourishing life. "

Fumio Sasaki changed his life when he became a minimalist. But before minimalism could really stick, he had to make it a habit. All of us live our lives based on the habits we've formed, from when we get up in the morning to what we eat and drink to how likely we are to actually make it to the gym. In Hello, Habits, Sasaki explains how we can acquire the new habits that we want\u2014and get rid of the ones that don't do us any good.  Drawing on leading theories and tips about the science of habit formation from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and sociology, along with examples from popular culture and tried-and-tested techniques from his own life, he unravels common misperceptions about \"willpower\" and \"talent,\" and offers a step-by-step guide to success. Ultimately, Sasaki shows how ordinary people like himself can use his principles of good habit-making to improve themselves and change their lives. "

                "You  can  build authentic social connections\u2014even while physically apart.  We are wired for social connection; our mental health depends on it. From a simple smile from a stranger on the street to a hug from a relative or close friend, we humans thrive when we feel connected to one another. And yet, loneliness is on the rise. The good news is, you don't have to continue suffering in silence. In this powerful audiobook, renowned mental health expert and addictions counselor Dr Bill Howatt drills into the root causes of isolation and loneliness\u2014including the double-edged sword of digital technology\u2014and shows you how to conquer them to achieve a more fulfilling, enriching life. Through a compelling mix of real-life case studies, self-reflection exercises, and cognitive behavioral techniques, you'll learn how to recognize your own self-limiting thoughts and behaviors, unlock your mental traps, and close the social connection gaps in all areas of your life\u2014from the personal to the professional. Employers will also find tips for boosting psychological safety in the workplace and among their virtual teams.  No single pill or exercise offers an escape from isolation; the cure for loneliness lies in a combination of realizing where you're stuck, and closing social connections gaps in meaningful ways. But if you commit to doing the work, you  can  become who you want to be. You  can  have more meaningful social connections. Ultimately, you'll see that  why  you feel isolated and lonely may not be as important as  what  you learn to do with it. "
