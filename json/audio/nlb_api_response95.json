                "MOST ANTICIPATED READS OF 2023: ELLE   The Millions   Essence / BEST SUMMER READS OF 2023: New York Times Book Review   USA Today   The Skimm   Bookpage   St Louis Post-Dispatch    \"Aisha Harris is one of our smartest, most entertaining modern cultural critics. The nine pieces offer insight on Stevie Wonder, the Spice Girls, Pen15, and New Girl\u2014among many other pop artifacts, of course\u2014which might as well be parlance for, 'Read me immediately.'\"     \u2014ELLE   Aisha Harris has made a name for herself as someone you can turn to   for a razor-sharp take on whatever show or movie everyone   is talking about. Now, she turns her talents inward, mining the benchmarks of her nineties childhood and beyond to analyze the tropes that are shaping all of us, and our ability to shape them right back.  In the opening essay, an interaction with Chance the Rapper prompts an investigation into the origin myth of her name. Elsewhere, Aisha traces the evolution of the \"Black Friend\" trope from its Twainian origins through to the heyday of the Spice Girls, teen comedies like Clueless, and sitcoms of the New Girl variety. And she examines the overlap of taste and identity in this era, rejecting the patriarchal ethos that you are what you like .  Whatever the subject, sitting down with her book feels like hanging out with your smart, hilarious, pop culture\u2013obsessed friend\u2014and it's a delight. "

                "A sharp-witted and deeply insightful look into the storied world of elite prep schools from the first African-American legacy student to graduate from The Taft School  Early on in Kendra James's professional life, she began to feel like she was selling a lie. As an admissions officer specializing in diversity recruitment for independent prep schools, she persuaded students and families to embark on the same perilous journey she herself had made\u2014to attend cutthroat and largely white schools similar to The Taft School, where she had been the first African-American legacy student only a few years earlier. Her new job forced her to reflect on her own elite education experience and to realize how disillusioned she had become with America's inequitable system.  In Admissions, James looks back at the three years she spent at Taft, chronicling clashes with her white roommate, how she had to unlearn the respectability politics she had been raised with, and the fall-out from a horrifying article in the student newspaper that accused Black and Latinx students of being responsible for segregation of campus. Through these stories, some troubling, others hilarious, she deconstructs the lies and half-truths she herself would later tell as an admissions professional, in addition to the myths about boarding schools perpetuated by popular culture.  With its combination of incisive social critique and uproarious depictions of elite nonsense, Admissions will resonate with anyone who has ever been \"the only one\" in a room, dealt with racial microaggressions, or even just suffered from an extreme case of homesickness.

                "As a 6'2\" dreadlocked black man, Tyler Merritt knows what it feels like to be stereotyped as threatening, which can have dangerous consequences. But he also knows that proximity to people who are different from ourselves can be a cure for racism.  Tyler Merritt's video \"Before You Call the Cops\" has been viewed millions of times. He's appeared on  Jimmy Kimmel  and  Sports Illustrated  and has been profiled in the  New York Times . The viral video's main point\u2014the more you know someone, the more empathy, understanding, and compassion you have for that person\u2014is the springboard for this book. By sharing his highs and exposing his lows, Tyler welcomes us into his world in order to help bridge the divides that seem to grow wider every day.In  I Take My Coffee Black,  Tyler tells hilarious stories from his own life as a black man in America. He talks about growing up in a multi-cultural community and realizing that he wasn't always welcome, how he quit sports for musical theater (that's where the girls were) to how Jesus barged in uninvited and changed his life forever (it all started with a Triple F.A.T. Goose jacket) to how he ended up at a small Bible college in Santa Cruz because he thought they had a great theater program (they didn't). Throughout his stories, he also seamlessly weaves in lessons about privilege, the legacy of lynching and sharecropping and why you don't cross black mamas. He teaches readers about the history of encoded racism that still undergirds our society today.By turns witty, insightful, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny,  I Take My Coffee Black  paints a portrait of black manhood in America and enlightens, illuminates, and entertains\u2014ultimately building the kind of empathy that might just be the antidote against the racial injustice in our society.

But when Issa Rae, the creator of the Shorty Award&#8211;winning hit series \"The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,\" is that introvert&#8212;whether she's navigating love, work, friendships, or \"rapping\"&#8212;it sure is entertaining. Now, in this debut collection of essays written in her witty and self-deprecating voice, Rae covers everything from cybersexing in the early days of the Internet to deflecting unsolicited comments on weight gain, from navigating the perils of eating out alone and public displays of affection to learning to accept yourself&#8212;natural hair and all. A reflection on her own unique experiences as a cyber pioneer yet universally appealing, The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl is a book no one&#8212;awkward or cool, black, white, or other&#8212;will want to miss.

Broke and eager to make a way for himself\u2014and away from the oppressively religious father wreaking havoc on his love life\u2014the affable, easy going, and quick-witted Stephen lands a much-coveted job as a doorman at a high-end building on Park Avenue.  Hilarity and drama soon abound as Stephen learns the dos and don'ts of being a doorman for the rich and famous and witnesses the antics going on behind the front entrance of this swanky building. In Building Material, he shares those entertaining tales and introduces an unforgettable cast of characters\u2014from Puerto Rican and Albanian doormen battling it out for turf to quirky one percenters to slimy sugar daddies to his peers, both friends and frenemies. Throughout, Stephen offers a glimpse into the unfathomable lives of the residents and a sharp portrait of an everyday man wanting more for himself.  Both poignant and laugh-out-loud funny, Building Material is a captivating true tale of class, failure, and redemption\u2014and how to come back swinging\u2014from a gifted young talent. "

'Part memoir and part masterclass in finding hope and joy in the face of unthinkable challenges. This isn't a book about cancer, it's a book about living'  \u2013 Jaquie Brown   Dai Henwood wanted to be a comedian even before he knew what a comedian was. He always knew there was something special in being able to make people laugh.  Over a 25-year career, the much-loved Kiwi entertainer and TV host has won every major comedy award in New Zealand. But in January 2023, Dai shared publicly that three years earlier he had been diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer.   Perhaps the ultimate teacher for what really matters, Dai's incurable cancer has shown him a new way of living that embraces small moments of perfection and cherishes things we often overlook.   As well as showing us how laughter can be a wonderful medicine \u2013 and there are many laughs in his book \u2013 Dai teaches us that often the gifts we've been searching for are right in front of us, if only we could see them.

I loved this and you will, too.\u201d\u2014Mindy Kaling, author of  Why Not Me?  and  Nothing Like I Imagined   What to do when you\u2019re the perpetual new kid, only child, and military brat hustling school to school each year and everyone\u2019s looking to you for answers? Make some shit up, of course!\u00a0And a young Jay Ellis does just that, with help from his imaginary friend, Mikey. A testament to the importance of invention, trusting oneself, and making space for creativity,  Did Everyone Have an Imaginary Friend (or Just Me)?  is a memoir of a kid who confided in his imaginary sidekick to navigate parallel pop culture universes (like watching  Fresh Prince  alongside John Hughes movies or listening to Ja Rule and Dave Matthews) to a lifetime of birthday disappointment (being a Christmas-season Capricorn will do that to you) and hoop dreams gone bad. Mikey also guides Ellis through tragedies, like losing his teenage cousin in a mistaken-target drive-by and the shame and fear of being pulled over by cops almost a dozen times the year he got his driver\u2019s license. As his imaginary friend morphs into adult consciousness,\u00a0Ellis charts an unforgettable story of looking inward to solve to some of life\u2019s biggest (and smallest) challenges, told in the roast-you-with-love voice of your closest homey.

Is she talking fondly of dictators? Has she suddenly started quietly muttering in the Aldi queue about the \"Jewish Space Lasers\" she's heard are setting wildfires around the world to make sure everyone believes in climate change? When was the moment the world began to believe anything?  Danny Wallace, million-copy bestselling author of  Yes Man  and  Join Me , has fallen down the modern rabbit hole of lies, conspiracies and disinformation. Along the way, he encounters families torn apart by accusations and fake news, journalists putting themselves on the frontline of the disinformation war, reformed conspiracy theorists, influencers who see profit in stoking paranoia, and the shadowy nameless, faceless trolls on the other side of our screens. He discovers how disinformation and well-told lies can ruin a year or a whole life, how they can affect our family, our street, our community. How they can spread across a country, a continent, even the world. How they take hold of our imaginations and make us feel both helpless and powerful. And Danny asks: can you do anything to stop it \u2013 even with the truth on your side? \u00a92024 Danny Wallace (P)2024 Penguin Audio. "

Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven audiobook offers clear, concrete language to introduce the concept of BODY LIBERATION. This audiobook serves to celebrate the uniqueness of your body and all bodies, and addresses the unfair rules and ideas that currently exist about bodies. It ends with motivational action points for making the world more fair for all! While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. "

With another 20 years of experience under his belt, bringing him to the half-century mark as a full-time farmer, he decided to build on that foundation with a sequel, a graduate level curriculum.   Everyone who reads (or listens to), and enjoys that previous work, will benefit from this additional information. In those 20 years, Polyface Farm progressed from a small family operation to a 20-person, 6,000-customer, 50-restaurant business, all without sales targets, government grants, or an off-farm nest egg.   As a germination tray for new farmers ready to take over the 50 percent of America's agricultural equity that will become available over the next two decades, Polyface Farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley stands as a beacon of hope in a food and farming system floundering in dysfunction: toxicity, pathogenicity, nutrient deficiency, bankruptcy, geezers, and erosion. Speaking into that fear and confusion, Salatin offers a pathway to success, with production, profit, and pleasure thrown in for good measure. This audio edition is wonderfully narrated by the author. Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont.  \u00a92017 Joel Salatin (P) "

                "The  New York Times  bestselling author of  Be the Bridge  calls people of faith to be a part of lasting change and help heal the racial disparity in our country\u2014together.   \u201cA journey that encourages us to love our neighbors in real time as we understand the history that has shaped us.\u201d\u2014Terence Lester, PhD, founder of Love Beyond Walls  We might think of systemic racism as an unfortunate part of American history, something that happened  back in the day.  But the systems were never truly dismantled in our country, leaving artifacts of injustice that continue to affect every aspect of life for Black and Brown Americans. \u00a0 Many of us feel overwhelmed by the problem, unsure how we can make a difference. Yet God calls the church to stand firmly committed to racial reconciliation\u2014and for each one of us to make choices that lead to healing. \u00a0 In  Brown Faces, White Spaces,  Latasha Morrison\u2014a speaker, bridge builder, and champion for unity\u2014explores nine aspects of American life where systemic racism still flourishes, including education, healthcare, the justice system, entertainment, and the church. Through story, historical context, and present realities, Morrison looks at what it means to recognize and confess the truth about inequities in the system (preparation), commit ourselves to changing the system (dedication), and move into true freedom as a society (liberation).\u00a0 \u00a0 Drawing on rich sociological insights, as well as experiences of family and friends and from her own life, Morrison asks:  How does knowing our country\u2019s history make a difference in how we live today? How does Jesus\u2019s divine act of reconciliation on the cross lead to human liberation from oppression? How might we create systems for all to flourish?  \u00a0 This honest, hope-filled book shows us how we can reform historically white spaces and create systems that work for the good of all. Join the bridge-building movement that is listening, learning, and working together for equity in every aspect of our lives.  Includes questions for personal reflection and group discussion. "

Challenging. Brave. Devastating. Hopeful.\" \u2014Rabbi Sharon Brous, IKAR, author of  The Amen Effect     A deeply insightful exploration of how to live with wisdom, resilience and love in our turbulent times  For the last quarter-century, author and activist Brian D. McLaren has been writing at the intersection of religious faith and contemporary culture. In  Life After Doom,  he engages with the catastrophic failure of both our religious and political leaders to address the dominant realities of our time: ecological overshoot, economic injustice, and the increasing likelihood of civilizational collapse. McLaren defines doom as the \"un-peaceful, uneasy, unwanted feeling\" that \"we humans have made a mess of our civilization and our planet, and not enough of us seem to care enough to change deeply enough or quickly enough to save ourselves.\" Blending insights from philosophers, poets, scientists, and theologians,  Life After Doom  explores the complexity of hope, the necessity of grief, and the need for new ways of thinking, becoming, and belonging in turbulent times. If you want to help yourself, your family, and the communities to which you belong to find courage and resilience for the deeply challenging times that are upon us \u2014 this is the book you need right now.

[a] bracing memoir.\u201d \u2014Kirkus Review    \u201cImportant. Riveting. Unforgettable . . . a profoundly captivating story that can profoundly change your own story.\u201d\u2014Ann Voskamp,  New York Times  bestselling author of  WayMaker   Born White in the heart of Zululand during the racial apartheid, Lisa-Jo Baker longed to write a new future for her children\u2014a longing that set her on a journey to understand where she fit into a story of violence and faith, history and race. Before marriage and motherhood, she came to the United States to study to become a human rights advocate. When she na\u00efvely walked right into America\u2019s own turbulent racial landscape, Baker experienced the kind of painful awakening that is both individual and universal, personal and social. Yet years would go by before she traced this American trauma back to her own South African past. Baker was a teenager when her mother died of cancer, leaving her with her father. Though they shared a language of faith and justice, she often feared him, unaware that his fierce temper had deep roots in a family\u2019s and a nation\u2019s pain. Decades later, old wounds reopened when she found herself spiraling into a terrifying version of her father, screaming herself hoarse at her son. Only then did Baker realize that to go forward\u2014to refuse to repeat the sins of our fathers\u2014we must first go back. With a story that stretches from South Africa\u2019s outback to Washington, D.C.,  It Wasn\u2019t Roaring, It Was Weeping  is a courageous look at inherited hurts and prejudices, and a hope-filled example for all who feel lost in life or worried that they\u2019re too off course to make the necessary corrections. Baker\u2019s story shows that it\u2019s never too late to be free. "

Waiting in the emergency room at Temple University Hospital in North Philadelphia where his eighteen-year-old nephew, Nasir, lay unconscious after being shot nine times, MK Asante began pouring his heart and soul into a series of letters to a beautiful, dying Black boy so full of life.  As Nasir fought for survival, MK realized there was so much\u2014too much\u2014that he had kept from his nephew, starting with the truth about his father, MK's brother, Uzi, whom Nasir had never met. MK could no longer remain silent because in many ways, his nephew was repeating the mistakes of the past. MK began his confessional to repair family bonds\u2014to save Nasir from the same streets that stole his father and to introduce him to the man and family history the young man had never known. The result is this beautiful, poignant, and honest family memoir.  Nephew introduces us to two men, strangers to each other, whose similarities are astonishing. Both have red hot tempers, both struggle with opioid addiction, and most profoundly, both are lyrical geniuses whose raps are raw, powerful, and autobiographical. Yet neither had ever heard the other's lyrics. As he tells his family's story, MK draws vivid portraits of both Nasir and Uzi through their songs\u2014lyrics that become the touchstone of their relationship. When father and son eventually meet, they confront each other and share a dialogue through their lyrics.  An explosive, innovative memoir of family, faith, poetry, secrets, love, race, poverty, redemption, addiction, Philadelphia, hip-hop, jail, purpose, mental health, and violence. Nephew is fast-paced, intimate, lyrical, educational, and inspirational. It is the epic, painful, poetic, and miraculous redemptive story of a new generation\u2014a new style of memoir for a new decade, the rhythmic story of a family in love, struggle, and verse. "

                "From award-winning actor and comedian Paul Scheer, a candid and hilarious memoir-in-essays on coming to terms with childhood trauma and finding the joy in embracing your authentic self,   featuring content exclusive to the audio edition, including excerpts from live shows and audio clips from home movies.   Paul Scheer has entertained countless fans and podcast listeners with stories about the odd, wild, and absurd details of his life. Yet these tales have pointed to deeper, more difficult truths that the actor and comedian has kept to himself. Now, he is finally ready to share those truths for the first time\u2014but, of course, with a healthy dose of humor.  Blending the confident, affable voice that has won him a dedicated following with a refreshing level of candor, Joyful Recollections of Trauma chronicles Paul's often shocking, admittedly tumultuous childhood and how the experiences of his youth have reverberated throughout his life. In his comedy, Paul has always been unafraid to \"go there,\" to play na\u00efve, cringeworthy characters, imbuing them with disarming charm and humanity. That daring openness is on display in the pages of this memoir, but in true Paul fashion, it is also surprising, eye-opening, and side-splitting.  In this madcap journey through the inner working of his mind and creative process, Paul Scheer demonstrates once again that the truth is often stranger\u2014and funnier\u2014than fiction. Joyful Recollections of Trauma offers a unique perspective on universal themes: growing up, working through a challenging childhood, staying true to yourself, and finding success, fulfillment, and happiness in often strange and difficult circumstances. Throughout, Paul shares both the hard-fought lessons and the laughter that can be found in the darkest parts of life, and reminds us that what matters is not what you've been through but who you are becoming. If you loved recent memoirs by Molly Shannon, Maria Bamford, RuPaul, and Jennette McCurdy\u2014or any book that moves you to both laughter and tears\u2014Joyful Recollections of Trauma is the perfect read for you.

No one has, not in many, many years. They used to be everywhere. You couldn't walk out of your front door in New York City in the 1930s without seeing dozens of those little guys scurrying around. Today, there are millions of grown up pigeons in New York, but not a baby pigeon to be seen. That's because they come out of the factory as adults. This is one of the many smoking guns of the bird drone surveillance crisis. Since 1959, the Deep State has mercilessly slaughtered over 12 billion birds and replaced them with identical drones that are designed to spy on private citizens and report their every action directly to the government. From pet canaries to  Sesame Street , the shadowy figures that pull the strings have infiltrated every aspect of our society, making a mockery of civil liberties while the American people live in blissful ignorance. Until now. In  Birds Aren't Real , whistleblowers Peter McIndoe and Connor Gaydos trace the roots of a political conspiracy so vast and well-hidden that it almost seems like an elaborate hoax. These hero Bird Truthers have risked life and limb to compile and disseminate a treasure trove of information about the origins of the surveillance crisis, its spread, and the patriots who are on the front lines today, raising awareness and working to reclaim America as the land of the free. This urgent manifesto features a host of useful illustrations, activities, and leaked classified documents that will convince even the most outspoken skeptic that birds aren't real. The truth is out there: will you stand and fight before it's too late?  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

We all want to live godly lives and navigate through the issues that arise with confidence, but so often we find ourselves wrestling with conflicting thoughts and feelings. I want to be a good daughter, but I can't trust my parent. I should pray more, but I'm frustrated with God. Instead of naming these thoughts and working through them, we try to force ourselves to act based on what we've been told. But this inevitably ends with us feeling stuck, trapped between the people we think we should be and the way we really feel.  What if this sidelining of our own thoughts and feelings is what's keeping us stuck? Building on psychological and spiritual insight, Dr. Alison Cook guides us through a practical strategy for acknowledging the tension and seeing the fuller truth. She shows us how to . . .  uncover the mixed emotions that keep us confused;  distinguish fact from fiction in our relationships;  make decisions that account for the entirety of a situation; and  start getting honest with ourselves, God, and other people.     As we learn to take a step back from our mixed emotions and see the fuller picture of the challenges we face, we stop feeling paralyzed and start seeing our way through the haze, moving forward with clarity and confidence.

We live on a planet infested with humans. They are a pernicious species, yet undeniably clever and capable\u2014even if the reasons behind their actions are often incomprehensible to us felines.  But while it is true that there have never been so many primates on Earth, in reality, they are quite simple to teach using well-practiced domestication techniques, such as loud vocalizations, strategic nighttime alarms, and selective displays of affection.  And if you choose your specimen carefully, you'll find that it can be completely tamed, and you'll end up with the best, most faithful companion you could possibly wish for.

Drawing on Scripture, story, and cutting-edge research into human behavior, pastor Craig Groeschel reveals the key to making the choices we want to make and experiencing the joy and freedom God has for us.   We all want to make great decisions. So what happens between our good intentions and the choices we actually make in the moment? If only we could make decisions ahead of time rather than when we're under stress, overwhelmed, or swayed by fear or emotion. In Think Ahead, we learn how to do just that.  Pastor Craig Groeschel knows from personal experience and as a counselor to others what being trapped in a cycle of poor decision-making is like. In Think Ahead, he shares what he has discovered about the power of \"pre-deciding.\"  With thought-provoking exercises and questions for reflection, this interactive book teaches us that the quality of our decisions determines the quality of our lives. Think Ahead will help you:  Understand the science behind your decision-making habits  Overcome decision fatigue and debilitating fears  Diminish the role of emotions in decision-making  See how your small choices shape the kind of person you become  Define and put into action the seven life-defining pre-decisions you can make today     Becoming the person you want to be starts before you even make a decision. In Think Ahead, you'll discover the power of making decisions today to help you live the life you want to have tomorrow. "

                "Scientist, physician, and pastor Stephen Ko explains how to live and worship incarnationally and glorify God with our bodies.   Many of us don't see much connection between spiritual and physical health. We say grace before digging into greasy, fatty meals we know are bad for us. We read Scripture on our phones before switching to social media feeds that hijack the neural circuitry in our brains. Or we take our physical health too seriously, distancing ourselves from the sick and the needy whom Jesus embraced.  On his journey from pediatrician to public health officer for the CDC to senior pastor of the largest New York Chinese Alliance Church, Stephen Ko has seen that these divisions between physical and spiritual health are artificial. In Faith Embodied, he reminds us that our \"bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit\" (1 Corinthians 6:19). Christ incarnate is deity in flesh, and His spirit is incarnate in us. Living and worshiping incarnationally is consciously embracing what the Creator has designed in His image, from the finest, microscopic details to vital organs within our body, enabling the Holy Spirit to work in us.  Faith Embodied will teach you to:  Understand subconscious ways that thwart the design of the Creator.  Embrace choices that invite incarnational health, living, and worship.  Experience God in every aspect of your life, from flesh and bone to heart and soul.  View the five senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste) in a different light  Reflect the image of God in the way you breathe, move, create, love, and rest.  Weaving together insights from faith, science, and medicine, Ko reveals the marvelous ways in which our physical and spiritual health can prepare us to become instruments of God's healing in the world.

Through focused alone time and question-driven journaling, Terri Savelle Foy will guide readers to discover how God has equipped them for purpose, hope, and success.   \"It's not one two-hour workout that shapes your body, it's twenty minutes of exercise daily.\" In The Alone Advantage, Terri Savelle Foy will show readers how a simple twenty-minute habit of listening to God can shape an entire life. Through practical steps and biblical truths, Terri will guide readers into action and help them learn the habits of successful people and how to do everything from cleaning up to waking up and writing their goals to becoming their own cheerleader in life.  Terri knows what it's like to live in a rut with no vision or goals for her life. For eleven years she existed on autopilot, repeating the same routine with no significant progress. Then she started carving out alone time, picked up a journal, and saw her life transform by applying the ten things successful people do behind closed doors. Now, Terri will prove how the greatest ideas can come in seclusion, strength will be found in solitude, and purpose will be discovered in privacy when nobody is around. Readers will  learn how to achieve success by starting with alone time, writing big questions to God;  discover why and how seclusion, even for just twenty minutes, yields great insight; and  understand the power of imagination to visualize and record dreams for the future.     The Alone Advantage reveals the five reasons successful people journal and how to mold a big dream into a daily to-do list that will inspire action. The key is a blank sheet of paper, time alone with God, and seeking his plan for your life. Through recording God's revelations and learning to listen, readers will see their doubts and anxiety about the future turn into hope and confidence! God has equipped each person with a unique passion, talent, and vision\u2014all it takes to put those in motion is twenty minutes of daily alone time with him. "

We suffer, we struggle, we grow weary. We wonder, Is God at work in my life? Is he near me? Is there any point to my suffering and any hope for change?  Though it's easy for our overwhelming pain to cloud our view of reality, the truth is that, even though we can't see it or feel it, God is at work in the darkness. Our Creator is in the business of bringing dead\u2014and nearly dead\u2014things to life.  Even now, no matter how fresh your wounds might be, he invites you to unearth his hidden treasures in your hurting, to reframe your darkness as a sacred space in which the light of hope can shine most brilliantly. Come join Katherine Wolf as she vulnerably shares her own places of wounding and the life-changing insights she has found there. Treasures in the Dark will guide you as you  find grace for the heartbreak of unmet expectations;  explore the surprising intersection of pain and purpose;  wholeheartedly embrace the life you never imagined living with perseverance and joy; and  recognize how your healing can be a part of the world's healing.

                "Brought to you by Penguin.   Hello there, come on in.   Firstly, I know what you're thinking, 'I'm not religious so I'm not sure if this is for me' but, the truth is, we can all benefit from having a little faith and it will look different to each of us. Granted, some of the stories   about a man who can walk on water and come back from the dead are anything but normal, but the point isn't about what we believe in, it's about believing in something. It's what humans have always done, it's in our DNA, because having faith in something makes us feel connected. It makes us feel like we matter. Faith means we are in it together, that we believe we will be OK.   So, yes, this book is about faith, but it's also about being human, because believing in things is just part of our existence. So, wherever you sit on the faith spectrum, I'm here to tell you it's okay. You don't have to sign up to all of something to get something out of some of it. You don't have to like every song on the album.   My belief has guided me through life's ups and downs, and I hope that sharing what I've learned will help you face your own challenges armed with hope, and plenty of lasagne.

This book is a call to manhood as designed by God. Masculinity is not only needed but necessary for a healthy home and society. James W. Bradford reflects upon the lessons he has learned from his life as he intricately weaves God's word into the messages. Through his unique storytelling, he calls men to rise up and assume their role as leaders in their families. "

Raised Catholic, she sang songs about Jesus as a child and lived in a house where nuns and priests were regular guests, yet she found herself questioning the faith of her family, examining the reasons none of it added up, and distancing herself from the God of Christianity.    Despite her questions\u2014or perhaps because of them\u2014she made a career out of trying to understand God, pursuing a PhD in religion. But even as she taught college students about mystics, theologians, and others who wrestled with God, she was never able to embrace a faith of her own.    In this searingly honest and deeply personal book, Freitas retraces her roundabout path up and out of the wilderness toward hope, and her dogged\u2014and ongoing\u2014search for faith. She talks about her experience with the Catholic abuse scandal, about being embraced as a speaker at evangelical colleges, about how the death of her mother and the loss of her marriage made her question everything she thought she knew about love, how she cannot reconcile the ways the concept of God makes absolutely no sense, and how she cannot stop trying to believe, despite it all.    Real, raw, and beautifully written,  Wishful Thinking  is a powerful story about the author's search for belief in God and about finding God in the most unexpected places. "

When it comes to navigating big decisions about when to stay and go, how can we know for sure when the time is right?

It's like he's crawling around inside your head opening file cabinets and telling you what the gibberish you've scribbled on each page in each file means. What a great, fun read.\"\"\u2014  Shea Serrano, #1 New York Times bestselling author    New York Times bestselling author Michael Arceneaux returns with a hilarious collection of essays about making your voice heard in an increasingly noisy and chaotic world.   In his books I Can't Date Jesus and I Don't Want to Die Poor, Michael Arceneaux established himself as one of the most beloved and entertaining writers of his generation, touching upon such hot-button topics as race, class, sexuality, labor, debt, and, of course, paying homage to the power and wisdom of Beyonc\u00e9. In this collection, Arceneaux takes stock of how far he has traveled\u2014and how much ground he still has to cover in this patriarchal, heteronormative society. He explores the opportunities afforded to Black creatives but also the doors that remain shut or ever-so-slightly ajar; the confounding challenges of dating in a time when social media has made everything both more accessible and more unreliable; and the allure of returning home while still pushing yourself to seek opportunity elsewhere.  I Finally Bought Some Jordans is both a corrective to, and a balm for, these troubling times, revealing a sharply funny and keen-eyed storyteller working at the height of his craft. "

                "A Most Anticipated Book of 2024: Elle, The Millions, LitHub, Nylon, BookPage, PureWow, and more    From the national bestselling novelist and essayist, a groundbreaking collection of brand-new pieces about the role of cultural criticism in our ever-changing world.   In her writing for Harper's, the London Review of Books, The New Yorker, and elsewhere, Lauren Oyler has emerged as one of the most trenchant and influential critics of her generation, a talent whose judgments on works of literature\u2014whether celebratory or scarily harsh\u2014have become notorious. But what is the significance of being a critic and consumer of media in today's fraught environment? How do we understand ourselves, and each other, as space between the individual and the world seems to get smaller and smaller, and our opinions on books and movies seem to represent something essential about our souls? And to put it bluntly, why should you care what she\u2014or anyone\u2014thinks?  In this, her first collection of essays, Oyler writes with about topics like the role of gossip in our exponentially communicative society, the rise and proliferation of autofiction, why we're all so \"vulnerable\" these days, and her own anxiety. In her singular prose\u2014sharp yet addictive, expansive yet personal\u2014she encapsulates the world we live and think in with precision and care, delivering a work of cultural criticism as only she can.  Bringing to mind the works of such iconic writers as Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, and Terry Castle, No Judgment is a testament to Lauren Oyler's inimitable wit and her quest to understand how we shape the world through culture. It is a sparkling nonfiction debut from one of today's most inventive thinkers. "

It is also a lighthearted way of having fun even through life's ups and downs. The Catholic Cowboy Way takes these same virtues and incorporates them into our walk with Christ. Following Jesus takes grit. By going all in with Him, Jesus teaches us how to fulfill the Father's will with passion and zeal. By learning from our Lord, we can also develop a childlike heart that can find peace and joy in the midst of the craziness of life in the twenty-first century. Incorporating two thousand years of Christian tradition, The Catholic Cowboy Way seeks to help cowboys practice the Catholic faith and Catholics discover their inner cowboy. Catholicism is about being fully human. The rawness and realness of the cowboy way can help Catholics discover God in depths never imaginable. The Catholic faith can help cowboys complete their ultimate quest for Heaven on earth. The world needs more Catholic Cowboys. If you're interested in fully becoming the person God created you to be, then saddle up. The Catholic Cowboy Way is an adventure of a lifetime!. "

                "#1 New York Times Bestseller    \"Medgar Evers deserves a place alongside Malcolm X and Dr. King in our historical memory. Evers, with Myrlie as his partner in activism and in life, was doing civil rights work in the single most hostile and dangerous environment in America.\"\u2014from Medgar and Myrlie    By MSNBC's Joy-Ann Reid, a triumphant work of biography that repositions slain Civil Rights pioneer Medgar Evers at the heart of America's struggle for freedom, and celebrates Myrlie Evers's extraordinary activism after her husband's assassination in the driveway of their Mississippi home.    \"\"I love this book. The empathic, brilliant, and wise Joy Reid has brought us the poignant, fascinating inside story of Medgar and Myrlie Evers, transformational leaders who confronted pure evil and risked their lives to ensure that all American children might grow up in a United States that was more just. As Reid shows us, that painful task is now more urgent than ever.\" \u2014 Michael Beschloss   Myrlie Louise Beasley met Medgar Evers on her first day of college. They fell in love at first sight, married just one year later, and Myrlie left school to focus on their growing family.  Medgar became the field secretary for the Mississippi branch of the NAACP, charged with beating back the most intractable and violent resistance to black voting rights in the country. Myrlie served as Medgar's secretary and confidant, working hand in hand with him as they struggled against public accommodations and school segregation, lynching, violence, and sheer despair within their state's \"black belt.\" They fought to desegregate the intractable University of Mississippi, organized picket lines and boycotts, despite repeated terroristic threats, including the 1962 firebombing of their home, where they lived with their three young children.  On June 12, 1963, Medgar Evers became the highest profile victim of Klan-related assassination of a black civil rights leader at that time; gunned down in the couple's driveway in Jackson. In the wake of his tragic death, Myrlie carried on their civil rights legacy; writing a book about Medgar's fight, trying to win a congressional seat, and becoming a leader of the NAACP in her own right.  In this groundbreaking and thrilling account of two heroes of the civil rights movement, Joy-Ann Reid uses Medgar and Myrlie's relationship as a lens through which to explore the on-the-ground work that went into winning basic rights for Black Americans, and the repercussions that still resonate today.

The Little House on the Prairie  was a childhood TV classic for a generation of kids, and Laura Ingalls Wilder's novels have never gone out of style for young bookworms. Her stories of her family's life in the 1870s offer countless gems of wisdom, and many facets of their lifestyle and the skills they relied on have become some of the hottest trends of today, from sourdough bread and modern pioneering to DIY prairie dresses and needlepoint.    Little House Life Hacks  playfully compiles the most crucial takeaways from that world, practical enough to work for pioneering stock and updated for today's evolving world. The Ingalls are the perfect reminders of what's important: love, family, community, honest work, and integrity. Alongside the life advice are selected inspirational quotes from the  Little House  books and show and fun pop culture tidbits (like that The Rock's first celebrity crush was original mean girl Nellie Oleson), as well as with meaningful takeaways for creating more balance, wellness, and fun in all aspects of your life.

                "Founder and CEO of consulting firm Change Cadet Dr. Akilah Cadet shares a powerful, incisive look at where we are in the fight to dismantle white supremacy\u2014and what we urgently need to do next\u200b.   This is the story of how I became an unapologetic Black disabled woman in a white world. This book is for people who look and live structurally like me to be valued, seen, heard and perhaps some advice on how to navigate life amongst white supremacy. This book is also for white people who have been \"doing the work\" since the murder of George Floyd to read my story and be able to clearly see systemic oppression, racism, and ableism. There are books sharing the historical context of white supremacy, providing tips on how to be an ally or anti-racist, and firsthand experiences from Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) which are important. I push the conversation that leads to real change through my story. This book is for the Black woman who is looking to been seen and soft in shared lived experience. It is for the white person who is immersing themselves in the community they want to advocate for. It is for anyone who understands that learning and unlearning is lifelong.     White Supremacy Is All Around  arrives as the U.S.'s ongoing racial reckoning has left readers searching for voices they can trust. BIPOC, disabled people, and other intentionally ignored Americans want to feel heard and empowered; organization leaders and allies invested in dismantling white supremacy want a framework for how best to contribute. Dr. Akilah Cadet speaks to all these needs, drawing from her life experiences and work helping leading brands build inclusive and equitable cultures to offer an informed perspective that prioritizes belonging. In a series of personal stories told with her trademark candor and wit, Dr. Cadet explores the long-term work required to combat structural oppression from her unique vantage point as a Black disabled woman. She tackles everything: from the 2020 \"summer of allyship \"  and depression caused by workplace discrimination to navigating disability and building a consulting business, all with a little inspo from Beyonc\u00e9.    A powerful call for true accompliceship for non-Black people, and a way for Black people to see and celebrate themselves,  White Supremacy Is All Around  ushers in a new voice that is timely, urgent, and essential\u2014and a vision we all need now.

                "Throughout personal essays spiked with humor and natural science, archaeologist R. E. Burrillo widens his range beyond his popular Behind the Bears Ears. After an upstate New York childhood and a bartending stint in New Orleans's French Quarter, seasonal resort work led R. E. Burrillo to the desert Southwest, whose redrock landscapes were a source of stability through mental and physical illness. In The Backwoods of Everywhere, archaeologist Burrillo excavates his past, examining Indigenous and tourist cultures, the complexities of American archaeology, and what it means to be a local. From the ancient canal systems of Phoenix, Arizona, to the modern Mayan communities of the Yucatan Peninsula, to the depths of the Grand Canyon, Burrillo brings listeners on an entertaining romp chock-full of history, ecology, cultural preservation, and personal stories. In the vein of Bill Bryson, Tim Cahill, and Ellen Meloy, Burrillo's is a fresh voice in humor-spiked nature writing and cultural commentary. Running throughout the wide-ranging topics of The Backwoods of Everywhere are themes of place and locality, and how these vary between cultures and individuals. Marrying the intensely personal with the complex and technical, Burrillo's candid voice brings humor, wonder, irony, and wit to each thought-provoking essay. "

While it contains sixty-six individual books written over thousands of years, it reveals one unified message\u2014the story of how God redeems humanity from sin and death and makes all things new. Scripture is God-breathed. Opening its pages, we discover who we are, why we are here, what happened to us, our eternal destiny, and how we live and breathe from day to day through God's redeeming love and His unconquerable grace.    In  Garden to Garden , readers discover how God moved through human history\u2014from the garden of Eden to the promise of eternity\u2014to restore us to His presence. Marian Jordan Ellis, the founder of This Redeemed Life Ministry, walks alongside readers as they journey through the Bible in an entirely fresh and unique way through this collection of short devotional readings that lead the reader through the story arc of God's great redemptive plan. Readers will come to understand that although the weeds of sin, shame, and blame grow wild in the human heart, our longing for Eden\u2014our true home\u2014always remains.    A holy invitation to know and be known by the Living God,  Garden to Garden  will enhance your knowledge of God's Word, provide you with a greater understanding of how to flourish in His grace, and reveal how Jesus makes all things new! While echoes of Eden fill the human heart,  Garden to Garden  points us home, to abide in the glorious and beautiful garden distinguished by the Presence of God. "

As she saw it, disorganization was one of her countless character flaws\u2014that is until she was diagnosed with ADHD at age 35. Like many girls who go undiagnosed, Emily grew up internalizing criticisms about her impulsivity and lack of follow-through. She held onto that shame as she tried (and often failed) to fit into a world designed for neurotypical brains.    I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is a personal essay collection of laugh-out-loud-funny, tear-jerking, and at times cringey true stories of Emily's experiences as a neurodivergent woman. With the newfound knowledge of her ADHD, Emily candidly reexamines her complicated relationships (including one with a celebrity stalker), her money problems, the years she spent unknowingly self-medicating, and her hyperfixations (two words: decorative baskets).     A memoir-in-essays both entertaining and enlightening,  I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is for people with ADHD, as well as those who know and love them. This is a powerful collection of deeply relatable, wide-ranging stories about a woman's right to control her own body, about overwhelm and oversharing, about drinking too much and sleeping too little, and about being misunderstood by the people closest to you. At its heart,  I'll Just Be Five More Minutes  is about not quite fitting in and not really understanding why\u2014something we've all felt whether we're neurodivergent or not. "

Through forty slices of the story of Calvary, master storyteller and vivid Bible teacher Charles Martin, will walk you back to the cross to look up at it from a different angle each day and ask the Father to reveal to you:  What exactly did he mean when the dying Jesus said, \"It is finished\"\u2014what was finished at the cross?  When did what Jesus finish at the cross even begin?  What does this man's death 2,000 years ago have to do with me today?  What is God offering at the cross that I so easily forget and take for granted?  What do I not realize about myself that the Father God has never forgotten?     Whether it is your first, tenth, or ten thousandth time looking up at the cross of Christ, you can trust New York Times bestselling author Charles Martin, to wrap an arm around your shoulder, come alongside and walk with you as a fellow pilgrim headed in the same direction and answering the same question: \"What will I do with this man, Jesus?\"  Because before we can celebrate the resurrection, we need to backtrack to where Jesus has been, how He got there, and what His presence there accomplished. And while Satan can't change what happened on that Friday, he has been working ever since to hide what happened there. To obscure the work of the Cross. To avert our eyes. But on this 40-day pilgrimage your eyes will open wide and your heart will race as you discover the answer to the question that can change your life, Lord, why me? Why would you endure the cross and despise the shame, for me?. "

But even when we achieve them, we still end up unhappy, unfulfilled, or lonely.  God wants us to be successful, but His definition of success is not the same as the world's definition. The truth is, God's way of achieving the dreams and desires that truly fulfill us and bring genuine joy to our lives is very different\u2014and that is what we need.  In  The Pathway to Success , you will discover a deeper understanding of what it means to seek success God's way. Through her practical, relatable insights based on God's Word, beloved Bible teacher Joyce Meyer reveals how to actively pursue the keys to true, lasting success. Full of rich encouragement and timeless wisdom,  The Pathway to Success  will allow you to refocus your life and fulfill your God-given destiny as you walk out the purpose He's planned for you. "

Lisa Whittle amplifies the solution to the heart cry of the \"sick of me\" life.   It is in the heart of every person to want God, but life gets loud, and we forget Him. We get consumed by our problems, our desires, ourselves. We forget our first encounter with the Savior and how much we once wanted Him. But Lisa Whittle believes that if we calibrate our attention, refocusing on God determines the perspective for everything in our life:  what we fight for,  what we tolerate,  how we make decisions,  what we choose,  what we love,  what we chase,  what we let go of, and  what we are willing to change.     A guidebook, a teacher, and a resource, all in one, I Want God brings rich simplicity to life-altering principles, perfect for your personal Lenten reflection. With her signature boldness and raw authenticity, author and podcast host of The Jesus Over Everything podcast, Lisa Whittle inspires with bottom line truth when we want Him and experience a soul revival, there is no limit to what we will do for Him.

                "In his own voice,  New York Times  bestselling author and pastor Steven Furtick helps listeners find their God-given identity and grow into the person God designed them to be, recorded at Elevation Church and including bonus content exclusive to the audiobook.     Do you ever get a glimpse of yourself that is exactly who you want to be, but always seems just out of reach? The happier, kinder, less stressed, more courageous you? The ideal version of you isn't imaginary at all. It's actually the authentic you trying to break through. And it's not a future version of yourself you have to chase. The true you may be new to you, but it's not new to God. It's the you he knew all along.    In   Do the New You  ,   New York Times   bestselling author and pastor Steven Furtick speaks directly to the challenge of living out your God-given identity and calling. He explores and unpacks six practical mindsets everyone can adopt to get from who you are today to where God is taking you. These six statements are truths you can speak over yourself any time and anywhere:     \u2022 I'm not stuck unless I stop.  \u2022 Christ is in me. I am enough.   \u2022 With God there's always a way and by faith I will find it.  \u2022 God is not against me, but he's in it with me, working through me, fighting for me.  \u2022 My joy is my job.  \u2022 God has given me everything I need for the season I'm in.     These simple, powerful, memorable phrases will shift your focus, feelings, and actions to align with God's vision of you. God isn't just calling you to do you. He's calling you to do the new you\u2014the unique and powerful person he created you to be.     Audiobook bonus content includes scripture passages to go with each of the six mindsets, set against original music; a motivational track read by the pastor called \"By Faith I Will Find It;\" and a live performance of the song \"God Is Not Against Me.\"     A Study Guide is also available for purchase. A Spanish edition, \u00a1  Renu\u00e9vate!  , is also available for purchase. "

                "A hilarious and incisive exploration of the joys of reading from a teacher, bibliophile, and Thurber Prize Semifinalist  We read to escape, to learn, to find love, to feel seen. We read to encounter new worlds, to discover new recipes, to find connection across difference, or simply to pass a rainy afternoon. No matter the reason, books have the power to keep us safe, to challenge us, and perhaps most importantly, to make us more fully human. Shannon Reed, a longtime teacher, lifelong reader, and New Yorker contributor, gets it. With one simple goal in mind, she makes the case that we should read for pleasure above all else. In this whip-smart, laugh-out-loud-funny collection, Reed shares surprising stories from her life as a reader and the poignant ways in which books have impacted her students. From the varied novels she cherishes (Gone Girl, Their Eyes Were Watching God) to the ones she didn't (Tess of the d'Urbervilles), Reed takes us on a rollicking tour through the comforting world of literature, celebrating the books we love, the readers who love them, and the ways in which literature can transform us for the better.

                "The debut memoir from award-winning journalist Morgan Campbell: an incredible history of a family\u2019s battles across generations, a hilarious and emotional coming-of-age story, and a powerful reckoning with what it means to be Black in Canada\u2014particularly when you have strong American roots.  Morgan Campbell comes from \u201ca fighting family,\u201d a connection and clash that reaches back to the south side of Chicago in the 1930s. His father\u2019s and mother\u2019s families were both part of the Great Migration from the U.S. rural south to the industrial north, but a history of perceived slights and social-class differences solidified a great feud that only intensified over the course of the century after the families came together in marriage and split up across the border. Morgan\u2019s maternal grandfather, Claude Jones\u2014a legendary grudge-holder, as well was an accomplished musician, peer of Oscar Peterson, and fixture of the Chicago jazz scene\u2014was recruited to play some shows in Toronto, fell in love with the city, and eventually settled in Canada in the mid-1960s, paving the way for Morgan\u2019s parents to join him amid the tumult of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement. Morgan\u2019s paternal grandmother, Granny Mary, however, remained stateside, a distance her schemes and resentments would only grow to fill.\u00a0 That fighting spirit wasn\u2019t limited to the family\u2019s own squabbles, though\u2014it animated the way every generation moved through the world. From battling back as a group against white supremacist newcomers who violently resisted Black neighbours, to Morgan\u2019s pre-teen mother burnishing her own legend by cold-cocking some racist loudmouth bullies, the lesson was clear: sometimes words weren\u2019t enough. In Canada, the Campbells started a family of their own, but the tensions between in-laws never ceased, even as divorce and disease threatened the very foundations of the life they\u2019d built. Bearing witness to all of this was young Morgan, an aspiring writer, budding star athlete, and slow-jam scholar, whose deep American roots landed him an outsider status that led to its own schoolyard scraps and exposed the profound gap between Canada\u2019s utopian multicultural reputation and the very different reality.\u00a0 Having grown up bouncing between these disparate identities and nationalities, real or imagined\u2014Black and Canadian, Canadian and American, Campbell and Jones\u2014 My Fighting Family  is a witty, wise, rich, and soulful illumination of the journey to find clarity in all that conflict.

Our shiny social media feeds and skin-deep smiles certainly give off a happy illusion. But we are not fine. Taylor has heard countless stories from her generation of our fetal positions on cold tile floors, immobilized by anxiety. She personally knows this place well. At eighteen, she too found herself in an anxiety-induced fetal position behind a locked bathroom stall, wondering, \"What did Jesus mean when he promised me full life?\" Stop Saying I'm Fine is a generational call to honesty, healing, and a spiritual hunger that defies superficial Christianity. We'll dig beneath the bedrock of our anxiety into the pain of our experiences, and together we'll learn how to connect to the stillness that exists beneath the chaos, finding that the wholeness and healing we long for isn't as distant as it may seem. - For the young adult who feels trapped inside their anxiety - For the parent or caregiver who aches to understand - For the wounded heart that can't seem to move on - For the weary one who has tried and failed a thousand other ways.

Kate is a pop culture commentator and host of the popular millennial-focused podcast  Be There in Five . Part-funny, part-serious, Kate navigates the complicated nature of celebrating and criticizing the culture that shaped her as a woman, while arguing that great depths can come from surface-level interests. With her trademark style and vulnerability,  One In a Millennial  is sharp, hilarious, and heartwarming all at once. She tackles AOL Instant Messenger, purity culture, American Girl Dolls, going out tops, Spice Girl feminism, her feelings about millennial motherhood, and more. Kate's laugh-out-loud asides and keen observations will have you nodding your head and maybe even tearing up.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

In the 1980s, their mother headed an organization of Black women physicians, and for years the girls watched these fiercely intelligent women in white coats tend to their patients and neighbors, host community health fairs, cure ills, and save lives. What Dr. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock did not understand as a child\u2014or learn about at Harvard Medical School, where she and her sister had followed in their mother\u2019s footsteps, making them the first Black mother-daughter legacies from the school\u2014were the profound and long-standing systemic inequities that mean just 2 percent of all U.S. physicians today are Black women; the racist practices and policies that ensure Black Americans have far worse health outcomes than any other group in the country; and the flawed system that endangers the well-being of communities like theirs. As an ER physician, and later as a professor in academic medicine, Dr. Blackstock became profoundly aware of the systemic barriers that Black patients and physicians continue to face.  Legacy    is a journey through the critical intersection of racism and healthcare. At once a searing indictment of our healthcare system, a generational family memoir, and a call to action,  Legacy  is Dr. Blackstock\u2019s odyssey from child to medical student to practicing physician\u2014to finally seizing her own power as a health equity advocate against the backdrop of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.

                "In the revised and updated edition of Falling Upward, Richard Rohr seeks to help listeners come to terms with the two halves of life. In this book, Rohr teaches us that we can't understand the meaning of \"up\" until we have fallen \"down.\" More importantly, Rohr describes what \"up\" can look like in the second half of life. Most of us tend to think of the second half of life in chronological terms, but this book proposes a different paradigm. Spiritual maturity is found \"when we begin to pay attention and seek integrity\" through a shift from our \"outer task\" to the \"inner task.\" Falling Upward is an invitation to living the gospel and a call to ongoing transformation. - Gain a spiritual perspective on the \"the common sequencing, staging, and direction of life's arc\" and learn how to bring forth your gifts in the second half of life - Grapple with difficult feelings, fears, and emotions associated with \"great love and great suffering\" - Learn how we \"grow spiritually much more by doing it wrong than by doing it right\" - Understand why so many of us resist falling into the second half of life.

                "Even on the days you struggle to stay strong, you can live a resilient and hopeful life.   After receiving a devastating brain cancer diagnosis, Jay Hewitt had a decision to make: Should he give up on faith or practice what he preached and trust that with God all things are possible? In I Am Weak, I Am Strong, Jay chronicles his journey of turning toward Jesus even when circumstances urged him to turn away. Faith in action for Jay included competing in an IRONMAN triathlon while undergoing cancer treatment. His race was a grand gesture of love for his young daughter\u2014and a call to resilience for all of us.  I Am Weak, I Am Strong reminds us that our true \"superpower\" comes from God. As you read Jay's honest and inspiring words, you will:  Understand the counterintuitive wisdom of strength in weakness  Learn to discern the voice of God and his calling for your life  Live with resilience in the face of any trial  Discover how God moves mountains\u2014even when you least expect it  Feel empowered to pray authentically, boldly, and continually     For anyone who is searching for hope in anxiety and grief, needs validation and compassion in times of doubt, is curious about faith in the face of death, or longs for a more authentic relationship with God, I Am Weak, I Am Strong will teach you that faith grows from the freedom to doubt.  Strength grows from realizing how weak we are on our own. And light grows when we follow God's dreams for us, even through the darkness. "

There is messiness in each of our stories, but we can use that mess intentionally to craft a life that points to God and proclaims his glory. In Restored, prominent pastor and speaker Chris Brown recounts some of the extraordinary tragedies and trials he has experienced, including homelessness, violence, abuse, drugs, and the loss of loved ones. Reflecting on these difficult times in his own story, Chris shares his hard-won countercultural perspective on pain, offering practical tips to inspire those of us who feel disqualified or discouraged by our circumstances. No matter how messy it was, our past is a gift because it paves the way for us to develop the unique Christ-honoring message the world needs us to share. "

He knew it and so did everyone else. He was grumpy, increasingly boring, mostly joyless. So, he joined a lawn bowls club. A week later, he doubled down on the doldrums by learning to dance like they do in Bollywood. Then - with an almost entirely reformed selfhood winking appealingly just around the corner - he started swimming in cold water and was back to square one. Despite the setbacks (and hyperventilation), it was becoming clear to him that the very pursuit of fun was a great way of not feeling naff. And so he made a vow to have as much of the f-stuff as he possibly could. Taking a liberal approach to the subject, he sought out things that he used to find fun a long time ago (i.e. food fights and wrestling); things that he'd never done before but reckoned could be fun (boozy French cooking classes, tantric sex); things whose fun-factor was less obvious and more down to earth (nostalgia, volunteering, edible gardening, watching chickens); and things that he wasn't at all sure about but were fun according to other people (gym classes, caving, TikTok). Unsurprisingly, the results were mixed, but he was undoubtedly left feeling ... better. Which left him asking, if fun is the finest medicine, why do we stop doing it?. "

Richardson and his wife, Lori, retraced the steps of his ancestor, George Richardson (1824-1911), across nine states, uncovering letters, diaries, and more memoirs hidden away. Their journey brought them to the brink of the racial divide in America, revealing how his great-great-grandfather Richardson played a role in the Underground Railroad, served as a chaplain to a Black Union regiment in the Civil War, and founded a college in Texas for the formerly enslaved. In narrating this compelling life, The Abolitionist's Journal explores the weight of the past as well as the pull of one's ancestral history. The author raises questions about why this fervent commitment to the emancipation of African Americans was nearly forgotten by his family, exploring the racial attitudes in the author's upbringing and the ingrained racism that still plagues our nation today. As America confronts a generational reckoning on race, these important perspectives add a layer to our larger national story. "

                "A tribute to and exploration of the magic behind one of Hollywood's most legendary and unknowable stars, Keanu Reeves, and the profound lessons we can learn from his success  There can be no doubt: Keanu Reeves is a phenomenon. He's at once a badass action star, a hunky dreamboat who People magazine has called \"the Internet's boyfriend,\" a vintage motorcycle enthusiast, a niche art book publisher, a living meme, and a legend. He seems to upend every rule governing celebrity in the twenty-first century. But how?  In Keanu Reeves: Most Triumphant, cultural critic Alex Pappademas attempts to address Keanu's unmatched eternality and the other big questions raised by his career arc. Sharp, funny, deeply researched, and fully celebratory of the enigmatic actor, this is the first book to take Keanu's whole deal as seriously as it deserves. Yes, even Johnny Mnemonic, where Keanu mind melds with a dolphin. Along the way, Pappademas reveals the lessons we can learn from Keanu about Hollywood, our broader culture, and even life itself. "

At ten months old, Holly Marie was brought to the door of a church by three barefoot women in white robes and head coverings. Adopted by the pastor and raised in a loving Christian home, Holly nevertheless struggled with the ache of not knowing what had happened to her biological parents. She still felt their absence even as she married and started a family of her own.     When two detectives showed up at the restaurant where she worked and informed her that she had a large family in Florida who had been searching for her for over 40 years, Holly's past became the reality of her present, and she began the sometimes painful journey of discovering the truth about her origins: Her parents had been brutally murdered, their case still unsolved.    With the help of law enforcement across four states, forensic genealogists, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and her newly discovered family members, the missing pieces began to come together. Except these\u2014 why had her parents been murdered? And who had murdered them?  She soon found out that the truth leads not always to answers but sometimes to more questions, that it also brings healing and restoration, and that we must surrender our unknowns to God until, in His perfect timing, all truths are revealed.    Finding Baby Holly  is the true, inspiring story of a wife and mother who was \"missing\" for over forty years after her parents' murders, the persistent detectives who never stopped investigating, and the birth family who never lost hope in finding her.

Jodi M. Savage was raised in Brooklyn, New York, by her maternal grandmother. Her whip-smart, charismatic mother struggled with addiction and was unable to care for her. Granny\u2014a fiery Pentecostal preacher who had a way with words\u2014was Jodi's rock, until Alzheimer's disease turned the tables, and a 28-year-old Jodi stepped into the role of caretaker. It was up to Jodi to get them both through the devastations of a deteriorating mind. After Granny passed away, Jodi spent years trying to reckon with her grief. Jodi and her mother were both diagnosed with breast cancer nearly a decade later, and then Jodi lost her too.  In this searing, candid collection of essays, Jodi illuminates the roles that identity and memory play in preserving those we love. Jodi explores the lives of modern Black women and communities through the prism of her personal experiences. With grace, creativity, and insight, she looks at femininity, family, race, mental illness, grief, healthcare, and faith. Jodi deftly portrays how trauma is inherited, and how the struggle to break a generational curse can last a lifetime.  The Death of a Jaybird is a thoughtful examination of complicated family love, loss, and the liberating power of claiming our stories. "

In conversation with each of these, Malcolm's sonnets offer profound insights into the nature of communion with God in all circumstances and conditions. Recognising that all poetry is a pursuit of prayer, After Prayer also includes forty five more widely ranging new poems, including a sonnet sequence on the seven heavens. "

Our home and our duties can, just like a monastery, teach us those things. The vocation of monastic men and women is to physically withdraw from the world. But the principle is equally valid for those of us who cannot go off to monasteries. Certain vocations offer the same kind of opportunity for contemplation, and provide a desert for reflection. In ten brief and powerful chapters, Fr. Ron explores how monastery life can apply to those who don't live in a cloister:    Monasticism and Family Life    The Domestic Monastery    Real Friendship    Lessons from the Monastic Cell    Ritual for Sustaining Prayer    Tensions within Spirituality    A Spirituality of Parenting    Spirituality and the Seasons of Our Lives    The Sacredness of Time    Life's Key Question.

                "In her quest to live a vibrant spiritual life, Karen Wright Marsh had a revelation: she didn't need to find and follow the perfect plan; she needed people she could follow. In Wake Up to Wonder, Marsh introduces us to those people-faithful yet oh-so-human Christians from across centuries and cultures. Inspired by their example, she offers playful, simple practices that bring deeper meaning and purpose to everyday life. In the company of diverse spiritual companions-from Dorothy Day, Francis of Assisi, and Fannie Lou Hamer to Patrick of Ireland, Wangari Maathai, and Henri Nouwen-listeners journey through physical health, prayer, activism, Scripture reading, creativity, and beyond. Each chapter includes hands-on invitations such as writing prompts, space for personal reflection, and \"Try This,\" a collage of spiritual and personal experiments anyone can do. As listeners wake up to wonder, they'll discover what these twenty-two historical figures already knew: that a life of spiritual depth, amazement, and connection is within reach-today and every day.

                "Welcome to Bryson City, a small town tucked away in a fold of North Carolina's Smoky Mountains. The scenery is breathtaking, the home cooking can't be beat, the Maroon Devils football team is the pride of the town, and you won't find better steelhead fishing anywhere. But the best part is the people you're about to meet in the pages of Bryson City Seasons.  In this joyous sequel to his bestselling Bryson City Tales, Dr. Walt Larimore whisks you along on a journey through the seasons of a Bryson City year. On the way, you'll encounter crusty mountain men, warmhearted townspeople, peppery medical personalities, and the hallmarks of a simpler, more wholesome way of life. Culled from the author's experiences as a young doctor settling into rural medical practice, these captivating stories are a celebration of this richly textured miracle called life.  A map is included in the audiobook companion PDF download.  \"The whole book is delightful. My only criticism: there wasn't enough of it!\" Margaret Brand, MD, co-laborer with Dr. Paul Brand in leprosy work in India. "

                "The football coach who fought all the way to Supreme Court for his right to pray shares his inspiring story of courage, redemption, and grace.  When Coach Joe Kennedy started offering a prayer on the field after each high school football game, the school district tried to shut him down, launching a seven-year legal battle that went to the Supreme Court\u2014twice. In June 2022, he won.  Average Joe is the story of an unlikely champion of religious freedom. A former atheist, Kennedy never imagined he'd lead the defense of Americans' First Amendment rights. He certainly didn't intend to be at odds with his wife, who was the school district's personnel director. But his love for God and country and his never-say-die courage landed this former Marine in the fight of his life.  The victory in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District opened the door for thousands of previously settled cases regarding public prayer to be reexamined with a friendlier eye to personal religious expression.  Average Joe: The Coach Joe Kennedy Story is a compelling personal account of his troubled youth, what he learned in the Marines, the lessons he instills in his players, his faith in God, and his love for his family. It's a story that will inspire readers to live more boldly. "
