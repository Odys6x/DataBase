                "Hope for the future lies with a new generation of regenerative farmers.  Within a decade, nearly half of all American farmland will change hands as an older generation of farmers steps aside. In their place, a groundswell of new growers will face numerous challenges, including soil degradation, insufficient income, and investors devouring farmland at a staggering pace. These new farmers are embracing regenerative agriculture\u2014the holistic approach to growing food that restores the soil and biodiversity\u2014in the movement to reclaim our health and the planet's. But can their efforts help reverse an epidemic of diet-related disease, food inequality, and even climate change? To answer that question and more, award-winning journalist Jennifer Grayson embedded herself in a groundbreaking farmer training program, then embarked on this investigative journey. The diverse array of farmers, graziers, and food activists whom she profiles here are working toward better, more sustainable foodways for all. From a one-acre market garden in Oregon to activists reviving food sovereignty in South Carolina,  A Call to Farms  tells the captivating story of these new agrarians finding hope and purpose in reconnecting to the land and striving to improve the future of American food.

When Jessica Chen entered the workforce, she felt like everything she had been taught growing up in a Quiet Culture household\u2014where deference, humility, harmony, and dogged hard work were praised \u2014 failed to set her up for success in the \u201creal world.\u201d Her ingrained values were in direct contrast with what was actually needed to stand out in a Loud Culture workplace. The result? Feeling underappreciated, passed over for opportunities and promotions, and completely stuck. Building on the lessons she learned as an award-winning TV news journalist, Chen \u2014 who now speaks at Fortune 100 companies and whose LinkedIn Learning courses have been watched by over 2 million people \u2014 introduces a new way of getting noticed at work, without being loud, aggressive, or boastful. In  Smart, Not Loud , Chen teaches readers how they can look within, to the values they already hold, to more effectively show up. Through instructive anecdotes and research-backed principles, readers will learn to:  speak up at meetings using the 4A Sequence (active listening, acknowledging, anchoring, and answering);\u00a0  advocate for themselves with tact;  build strategic relationships to enhance credibility and get picked for the best projects;  and master the five elements of voice\u2014pitch, rate, intensity, inflection, and quality\u2014to be the kind of communicator others want to listen to.  Packed with actionable tips,  Smart, Not Loud  unveils a new path to getting noticed and getting ahead at work. This is the road map readers need to authentically show up in the workplace and truly feel seen. "

It introduces the Head, Heart, and Hands Listening model as a vital tool to amplify effective listening in coaching practice. Accessible and applicable, the book explores the three listening modalities of Head, Heart, and Hands as active, though largely unconscious, lenses that inform the potency of our listening. Dakin-Neal argues that once coaches identify \"how\" they listen, they can assist their clients in more targeted ways to positively impact their personal and professional lives. Chapters are divided into the three listening modalities, Head, Heart, and Hands, and are filled with case studies, stories, reflective questions, and exercises from the author's experience to help coaches strengthen their listening skills. The book also includes a comprehensive listening assessment for coaches to use in practice. This book is essential for coaches in practice and in training as well as organizational psychologists, HR professionals, and those working within corporations. "

How-to's, exercises, and journal prompts interweave with Jessica's powerful personal story to create a guidebook to a more inclusive, loving, and Light-filled life. Within this audiobook lies radical self-empowerment, because\u2014as Jessica says\u2014when you can claim all parts of yourself (your dark and your light, your power and your shame, your sh*t  and  your shine), you become... unstoppable.

The company had been humiliated by headlines, painted as complicit in the manipulation of democratic voting and an assault on the global social fabric. Their stated mission was to connect people, but they couldn't afford to destroy society in the process. And so they hired a small team to make sure they didn't repeat the same mistakes. From the Wall Street Journal reporter whose explosive stories have rocked Facebook and its leadership, this is the story of the Civic Integrity Team: a select band of engineers, coders, economists, and experts hired to peer inside the company's secretive algorithms for the first time and find out what exactly was going wrong. They were successful. Too successful. The Integrity unit discovered proof that Facebook distorted and amplified the basest of human impulses. The company was not merely providing a platform for bad actors but amplifying their power for profit. Enduring personal trauma and professional resistance in their often lonely and dark investigations, the Integrity team nevertheless isolated many of Facebook's worst problems, complete with tentative and hopeful steps to solve them - only to discover that they were set up to fail, and would have to take matters into their own hands. \u00a92023 Jeff Horwitz (P)2023 Penguin Audio.

And WIN where it matters most!  When you think of success, what comes to mind? Career, public achievements, diplomas, degrees? We work hard to find a job, gain promotions, and develop skills to become a peak performer. We're continually striving to win at work. But does winning at work mean we have to lose at home? In all our \"winning,\" are we neglecting what matters most?  Through advances in technology, the rise of social media, and the growing shift to working from home, our personal and professional lives are becoming increasingly intertwined. Struggles at home cause struggles at work and vice versa. Unfortunately, too many leaders achieve career success, only to find they have critically damaged their relationships with the people closest to them.  Winning Begins at Home will help you change all that. The book features a man who may be on a path similar to yours\u2014having a thriving business while a chasm grows between his family and himself. When our businessman meets a mentor who guides him through an action plan for getting his family back on track, he finds hope. And you will too! Part story, part assessment and workbook, this book will lead you through exercises, writing prompts, and action steps that will help you create a blueprint for the family you want. You've developed a growth plan to win at work. It's time to develop one for the place that matters most. It's time to start winning at home!. "

                "A thoroughly researched and deeply personal examination of how women unintentionally condone workplace abuse in a post-#MeToo world\u2014and what we can do to change things for the better.   When Reah Bravo began working at the  Charlie Rose  show, the open secret of Rose's conduct towards women didn't deter her from pursuing a position she thought could launch her career in broadcast journalism. She considered herself more than capable of handling any unprofessional behavior that might come her way. But she soon learned a devastating truth: we don't always react to abusive situations as we imagine we will.   When we live in a society where many feminist ideals are mainstream and women hold positions of power, how is it possible that sexual misconduct remains so prevalent? When many employers mandate trainings to prevent harassment of all kinds, why is workplace abuse still so rampant?   Weaving her own experience with those of other women and insights from experts, Bravo reveals the psychological and cultural forces that make us all enablers of a sexist and dangerous status quo. By bringing these hard truths into the light,  Complicit  charts an accessible path toward a better future. "

                "This program is read by the author. The ultimate playbook for crushing it at work, from the former CEO of Barstool Sports.  She worked hand-in-hand with a founder who was a lightning rod for controversy\u2014OK, for stepping in it. She grew a chaotic company (Vanity Fair called it a \"pirate ship\") housed over a dentist's office outside of Boston that published giveaway papers into a juggernaut with more than 5 billion monthly video views and 225 million followers valued at 550 million dollars. Erika Ayers Badan calls herself a \"token CEO\", the rare female employee in the highest rank of a bro-roar sports and new media culture.  She's also a massive student of work: how to do it, how to be effective at it, how to get noticed, how to crush it, how to figure out what you love and do it as a job. She's figured it out, after big marketing jobs in large traditional corporations like Microsoft and AOL, for herself; she's figured it out for friends; she figured it out for the thousands of people who listened to her Barstool podcast, \"Token CEO\" every week. And in this book, she's figuring it out for everybody else.  With the verve and motivation of books like YOU ARE A BADASS and the smart, specific ideas of titles like ATOMIC HABITS, NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR CAREER is a real playbook. It's about how work really works and how you can get work to work for you. It's about thank you notes and thankless tasks, the energy in meetings and energy vampires, how to pick a boss and how to get a boss to pick you. It's about being all in (but not bringing your whole self to work\u2014some of you is better left at home) and becoming valuable to your workplace. It's about participating\u2014with your brain, your skills, your experience, and your willingness to pitch in and offer yourself up for something you may not even know how to do yet. It's about making your own luck at work.  NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR CAREER is for first-time job seekers who think no company will ever want them, people stuck in second or third jobs who don't know how to move on to the next thing, people who have the job they thought was their brass ring but who discovered it's not all that.  Her chapter titles include:  - Do Whatever Makes You Happy and F*ck Anyone Who Says Otherwise  - Know What Your Company is Paying You to Do  - Don't Be an Asshole at Work  - The Messy Stuff: Being Human, Getting Drunk, Sex, and Other Disaster Scenarios at Work  - Feedback is a Gift.

Jaime Rogozinski and Jordan Zazzara were not what anyone would mistake for traditional financial power players. But they turned WallStreetBets, a subreddit focused on risky financial trading, into one of the most disruptive forces to bubble up from the fringes of the internet. This crude and unassuming message board harnessed the power of memes and trolling to create a new kind of online community. The group intertwined with the distrust and turmoil of our times and spoke to a generation of young men who were struggling to find their place in the world.   Deeply reported and fast moving, The Trolls of Wall Street is the suspenseful story of the people who made and lost millions, battling with each other\u2014and with Wall Street\u2014for power and status. It is a sobering account of how millions of young Americans became obsessed with money and the markets, casting a long and lasting influence over finance, politics, and popular culture. "

                "\"Entertaining and informative. Desai takes us on a journey through the fundamentals of finance, from asset pricing to risk and risk management, via options, mergers, debt, and bankruptcy.\"- John Lanchester, The New Yorker  \"A fascinating new perspective on modern finance,\" \u2014Oliver Hart, 2016 Nobel Laureate in Economics   \"Lucid, witty and delightfully erudite...From the French revolution to film noir, from the history of probability to Jane Austen and The Simpsons, this is an astonishing intellectual feast.\" \u2014Sebastian Mallaby, author of The Man Who Knew: The Life and Times of Alan Greenspan   Longlisted for 2017 Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year    A 2017 AMAZON PICK IN BUSINESS & LEADERSHIP   A WealthManagement.com BEST BUSINESS BOOK OF 2017   In 1688, essayist Josef de la Vega described finance as both \"the fairest and most deceitful business . . . the noblest and the most infamous in the world, the finest and most vulgar on earth.\"  The characterization of finance as deceitful, infamous, and vulgar still rings true today \u2013 particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But, what happened to the fairest, noblest, and finest profession that de la Vega saw?   De la Vega hit on an essential truth that has been forgotten: finance can be just as principled, life-affirming, and worthy as it can be fraught with questionable practices. Today, finance is shrouded in mystery for outsiders, while many insiders are uneasy with the disrepute of their profession. How can finance become more accessible and also recover its nobility?  Harvard Business School professor Mihir Desai, in his \"last lecture\" to the graduating Harvard MBA class of 2015, took up the cause of restoring humanity to finance. With incisive wit and irony, his lecture drew upon a rich knowledge of literature, film, history, and philosophy to explain the inner workings of finance in a manner that has never been seen before.  This book captures Desai's lucid exploration of the ideas of finance as seen through the unusual prism of the humanities. Through this novel, creative approach, Desai shows that outsiders can access the underlying ideas easily and insiders can reacquaint themselves with the core humanity of their profession.  The mix of finance and the humanities creates unusual pairings: Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope are guides to risk management; Jeff Koons becomes an advocate of leverage; and Mel Brooks's The Producers teaches us about fiduciary responsibility. In Desai's vision, the principles of finance also provide answers to critical questions in our lives. Among many surprising parallels, bankruptcy teaches us how to react to failure, the lessons of mergers apply to marriages, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model demonstrates the true value of relationships.  THE WISDOM OF FINANCE is a wholly unique book, offering a refreshing new perspective on one of the world's most complex and misunderstood professions. "

                "Part memoir, part searing revelation, Seen Yet Unseen takes readers behind the scenes of some of the world's biggest tech companies and exposes the way their exclusion of and, at times, hostility toward Black women have lasting impacts on the technology we use every day.  Over the years the products of big tech companies and Silicon Valley have become indispensable to our lives. They impact the way we socialize, make purchases, and even our medical decisions. But what happens when a major segment of the population\u2014in this case Black women\u2014isn't included in these companies?  For over a decade, B\u00e4r\u00ed A. Williams has worked to carve a space for herself as a Black woman in the incredibly white male sphere of major tech companies, eventually becoming a lead counsel at Facebook and architect of their supplier diversity program. However, she also experienced the peculiar feeling familiar to Black women in the workforce: being both unseen and too seen. In raw and personal stories, Williams recounts balancing on glass cliffs while battling the burnout that so often forces Black women out of these companies, and how the industry's lack\u2014and loss\u2014of Black women not only harms the businesses themselves but has troubling ramifications for their products, particularly as the promises of AI and the Metaverse loom large.  In a tone both forthright and revealing, Williams dissects how a culture that has largely excluded Black women\u2014and people of color more generally\u2014is at a tipping point and that only through embracing and listening to Black women can we prevent the further weaponization of these technologies against marginalized communities. From fledgling in-house diversity initiatives to gentrification and the rise of AI, Seen Yet Unseen takes the reader inside the obscured machinations of big tech companies and makes a case for why diversity is essential to the future of technology.

                "Globally recognized expert on learning and leadership, Jeff Wetzler offers a hands-on, surprisingly effective way to find out what others really think, know, and feel. Ask leads to smarter decisions, more creative solutions, and deeper relationships.       Too often, we don't find out what's truly on others' hearts and minds because we don't know how to ask the right questions in the right ways. Co-founder of Transcend and former international business consultant and Teach for America executive Jeff Wetzler wants to show you how to fix that. In Ask, he brings you a powerful method called The Ask Approach\u2122, based on a simple premise: that tapping into what other people truly think, know, and feel is a game-changing superpower.     In Section I, Wetzler reveals the most common things that people think and feel but often keep to themselves, as well as the key reasons why they choose to withhold information that could be valuable to you and your organization.    Section II delves into the five steps of the Ask Approach, each answering an essential question:     Choose Curiosity: How can you awaken your curiosity to make new discoveries and unexpected connections?      Make it Safe: How do you make it easier for people to tell you hard things?      Pose Quality Questions: What questions will best tap into the wisdom of anyone you ask?      Listen to Learn: How can you hear what someone is really trying to tell you?      Reflect & Reconnect: How do you turn talk into action?     Section III helps you make asking an everyday superpower \u2013 not only for yourself but also for your team and organization, as well as for the next generation and society at large.    The skills and messages of Ask could not be more timely. In a fast-changing world where AI is supplanting an increasing range of skills, the ability to learn from and connect with other people is one of the most important, fulfilling and uniquely human capabilities to master.

                "A stirring, comprehensive look at the state of women in the workforce\u2014why women's progress has stalled, how our economy fosters unproductive competition, and how we can fix the system that holds women back.   In an era of supposed great equality, women are still falling behind in the workplace. Even with more women in the workforce than in decades past, wage gaps continue to increase. It is the most educated women who have fallen the furthest behind. Blue-collar women hold the most insecure and badly paid jobs in our economy. And even as we celebrate high-profile representation\u2014women on the board of Fortune 500 companies and our first female vice president\u2014women have limited recourse when they experience harassment and discrimination.     Fair Shake: Women and the Fight to Build a Just Economy  explains that the system that governs our economy\u2014a winner-take-all economy\u2014is the root cause of these myriad problems. The WTA economy self-selects for aggressive, cutthroat business tactics, which creates a feedback loop that sidelines women. The authors, three legal scholars, call this feedback loop \"the triple bind\": if women  don't  compete on the same terms as men, they lose; if women  do  compete on the same terms as men, they're punished more harshly for their sharp elbows or actual misdeeds; and when women see that they can't win on the same terms as men, they take themselves out of the game (if they haven't been pushed out already). With odds like these stacked against them, it's no wonder women feel like, no matter how hard they work, they can't get ahead.    Fair Shake  is not a \"fix the woman\" book; it's a \"fix the system\" book. It not only diagnoses the problem of what's wrong with the modern economy, but shows how, with awareness and collective action, we can build a truly just economy for all. "

According to recent studies, barely a third of American workers feel \"engaged\" at work, and for many people around the world, happiness is lowest when earning power is highest. After a global pandemic that changed why, how, and what people do for a living, many workers find themselves wondering what makes their daily routine worthwhile.  In  Is Your Work Worth It? , two professors \u2013 a philosopher and organizational psychologist \u2013 investigate the purpose of work and its value in our lives. The book explores vital questions, such as:    Should you work for love or money?    When and how much should you work?    What would make life worth living in a world without work?    What kind of mark will your work leave on the world?    This essential book combines inspiring and harrowing stories of real people with recent scholarship, ancient wisdom, arts, and literature to help us clarify what worthy work looks like, what tradeoffs are acceptable to pursue it, and what our work can contribute to society.

From the self-made businesswoman and founder of the global platform  Build Like A Woman  comes the essential resource to unleash your business, take up space, and create your dream life.  In a world of hustle culture and burnout, women don't want to lean in, they want to lie down. Now more than ever, women are looking to leave the corporate grind to break out into their own entrepreneurial ventures in a way that feeds their life rather than consumes it. But they don't know exactly where to start. Kathleen Griffith has been in these exact shoes. When she set out to launch her own business she found that the women's business space was big on \"go, girl\" messages, but short on the gritty details of actually building a business. So she taught herself everything she could, learned from the best minds in business and coached with personal growth experts. She realized, shockingly, that all the \"mindset\" work paid the highest dividends of all in her business, and that through this process she had developed a proven method for success. Blending foundational  mindset  tenets with the practical, actionable, business-building  skillsets ,  Build Like A Woman  is for aspiring and existing entrepreneurs who want to start and scale a business AND life they love. From corporate dropouts to side hustlers to recent college grads to full-fledged founders. This is not a regular business book, but an unconventional blueprint for creation. It will shake up any belief that's holding you back, remove any barriers standing in your way and unlock your full potential.  Tools you'll get to break ground in business and break through in life: \u25cf Life Design \u25cf Wellness Practices  \u25cf Personal Power  \u25cf Mindful Leadership  \u25cf Money Management  \u25cf Customer Target \u25cf Brand Strategy \u25cf Marketing Plan \u25cf Sales Pitch   Are you ready to BUILD?

                "What explains the massive worldwide success of video games such as Fortnite, Minecraft, and Pokemon Go? Game companies and their popularity are poorly understood and often ignored from the standpoint of traditional business strategy. What lessons can we draw from its major successes and failures about the future of entertainment? One Up offers a pioneering empirical analysis of innovation and strategy in the video game industry to explain how it has evolved from a fringe activity to become a mainstream form of entertainment. Joost van Dreunen analyzes how game makers, publishers, and platform holders have tackled strategic challenges to make the video game industry what it is today. Using more than three decades of rigorously compiled industry data, he demonstrates that video game companies flourish when they bring the same level of creativity to business strategy that they bring to game design. Filled with case studies of companies such as Activision Blizzard, Apple, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nexon, Sony, Take-Two Interactive, Tencent, and Valve, this book forces us to rethink common misconceptions around the emergence of digital and mobile gaming. One Up is required for investors, creatives, managers, and anyone looking to learn about the major drivers of change and growth in contemporary entertainment. "

                "Build financial literacy, improve your money management skills, and make the  dinero  work for you!    In many immigrant households, money isn't often a topic of discussion, so financial education can be minimal\u2014especially when a family is just trying to survive the day-to-day. Despite being the largest minority group in the United States, the Latino community still faces cultural and systemic barriers that prevent them from building wealth. As a first-generation Latina, Jannese Torres, award-winning money expert, educator, and podcaster, knows these unique challenges well. She set out to pursue the traditional American Dream, becoming the first woman in her family to graduate from college, climb the corporate ladder, and secure the six-figure paycheck, only to find herself miserable and unfulfilled. She soon realized that everything she'd been taught about money and success wasn't as it seemed. After discovering the true meaning of wealth, Torres resolved to pave her own path, leaving the life she was told she should want for one of entrepreneurship, autonomy, and financial freedom.    In  Financially Lit!  Torres offers you culturally relevant and relatable personal finance advice that will allow you to finally feel seen, heard, and understood. Whether it's the guilt you feel from being the first person to \"make it\" while members of your family are still struggling, or the way financial trauma manifests itself in negative and limiting beliefs around money, Torres is here to guide you through it all.    With the warmth and no-nonsense wisdom of someone who's been there before, Torres will teach you how to:   set boundaries with your dinero    protect yourself from financial abuse    navigate the complicated relationship between amor and money    invest like a white dude\u2014or better!     With  Financially Lit!  at your side, you'll harness the powerful ways money can be used to create the life of your dreams, and be empowered to step into financial freedom. "

                "The author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller Ultralearning explores why it's so difficult for people to learn new skills, arguing that three factors must be met to make advancement possible, and offering 12 maxims to improve the way we learn.   Life revolves around learning\u2014in school, at our jobs, even in the things we do for fun. Yet learning is often mysterious. Sometimes it comes fairly effortlessly: quickly finding our way around a new neighborhood or picking up the routine at a new job. In other cases, it's a slog. We may spend hours in the library, yet still not do well on an exam. We may want to switch companies, industries, or even professions, but not feel qualified to make the leap. Decades spent driving a car, typing on a computer, or hitting a tennis ball don't reliably make us much better at them. Improvement can be fickle, if it comes at all.  In Get Better At Anything, Scott Young argues that there are three key factors in helping us learn:  See\u2014Most of what we know comes from other people. The ease of learning from others determines, to a large extent, how quickly we can improve.  Do\u2014Mastery requires practice. But not just any practice will do. Our brains our fantastic effort-saving machines, which can be both a tremendous advantage and a curse.  Feedback\u2014Progress requires constant adjustment. Not just the red stroke of a teacher's pen, but the results of hands-on experience.  When we're able to learn from the example of other people, practice extensively ourselves, and get reliable feedback, rapid progress results. Yet, when one, or all, of these factors is inhibited, improvement often becomes impossible. Using research and real-life examples, Young breaks down these elements into twelve simple maxims. Whether you're a student studying for an exam, an employee facing a new skill at work, or just want to get better at something you're interested in, his insights will help you do it better.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Companies need to adopt a new mindset and build distributed teams with a unique set of skills to succeed in new markets. A new strategic approach and revision to the agile methodology are necessary to better balance the need to localize with the complexity that localization creates. To date, business leaders have had to learn how to scale globally the hard way-through trial, error, and failure-since no guidebook existed to light the way . . . until now. Enter Global Class. Global Class is the playbook that teaches you how to build teams, manage a diverse international footprint, and balance cultural differences to scale globally by focusing locally. Through case studies and insights from more than 250 of the world's fastest growing companies, Aaron McDaniel and Klaus Wehage illuminate what this new class of business (\"Global Class Companies\") does to succeed, and who are the catalysts of their growth (\"Interpreneurs\") and how they do it. From market entry to international growth, Global Class introduces a comprehensive tool kit of practical frameworks that provide a blueprint for how to build and manage a global business. "

Through the help of a special teacher, he and his classmates learn to overcome challenges and harness the power of seeking to understand new perspectives and viewpoints. The class experiences the power of connection inside the activities during puzzle week, and along with their new student, finds the confidence to embrace their unique traits and appreciate and celebrate the uniqueness in each other. In Superpower, you'll find: games to help you discover common interests and get to know those around you on a deeper level; exercises to learn about what it means to have different perspectives and learn from the stories of others; and discussion questions for deeper reflection and for group book studies. An eye-opening and thought-provoking journey through difference, self-acceptance, and understanding, Superpower shows us how to impact the world for good using our very own, built-in superpowers. "

                "An essential guide to protect yourself from burnout by learning to develop and master key emotional intelligence skills   Why do some people in the world's most stressful careers avoid burnout while countless others are overwhelmed by the demands of ordinary jobs? What can we learn from these resilient role models who seem to be naturally resistant to the psychological hazards of work?  After extreme stress caused a life-threatening health cri\u00adsis in her own life, Dr. Kandi Wiens left a lucrative career in management consulting and enrolled in a doctoral pro\u00adgram at the University of Pennsylvania to understand why work was leaving millions of us sick, exhausted, unmoti\u00advated, and feeling stuck and ineffective. In her research, she discovered something remarkable: Despite dangerous levels of work-related stress, some people seemed to be naturally \"immune\" to burnout.  So what did these people have that Dr. Wiens and mil\u00adlions of others did not? In digging further, she uncovered one key difference: Regardless of their role, industry, or experience, all these professionals exhibited a high degree of emotional intelligence (EI). EI is the ability to clearly perceive, understand, and productively manage emo\u00adtions, thoughts, and behaviors in service of one's overall well-being and performance. The people with burnout immunity were relying on specific EI skills to successfully cope with stressful work environments and experiences. The result is that they were more productive; had happier careers and lives; and were free from the physical and men\u00adtal ravages of exhaustion, negativity, and inefficacy that characterize burnout.  The good news is that everyone can build and boost emotional intelligence and use EI-based skills to manage workplace stress before it leads to breaking down or burn\u00ading out. Burnout Immunity shows readers how to develop and master the EI skills, principles, and strategies Dr. Wiens uncovered in her research, including  Awareness  Regulation  Meaningful Connections  Mindset  Recover, Reconnect, and Reimagine  and bring them to bear on their own unique roles and work environments.  Bolstered with research, exercises, self-assessments, and real-life stories from people with natural burnout immu\u00adnity and those who've cultivated it, Burnout Immunity teaches workers how to positively cope with stress and to enjoy healthier and happier relationships with work.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

If we struggle, it's because we're weak and uncertain. Bruce Daisley thinks this is simply untrue, and in his new book the  Sunday Times  bestselling author of  The Joy of Work  takes the notion of resilience apart, explains how it really works, and puts forward a new programme for building self-confidence and tenacity. He calls it Fortitude. In this book, Daisley disproves the myth that only extraordinary people are successful, shows how to achieve a sense of control through simple mind exercises, and, above all, demonstrates how we can draw on those around us to empower ourselves and build our inner-strength. Offering empirically tested advice,  Fortitude  sets out a practical path to greater self-confidence and courage, not just for the elite few, but for us all. \u00a9 Bruce Daisley 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022.

Growing up on New York's Upper West Side in a bustling family of Jewish immigrants, Joshua Benaim discovered the power of place as he learned from his grandfather the art of minimizing risk while pursuing value in the world's toughest business\u2014New York City real estate. And when a chance encounter in a cab led him to study opera, Benaim's time as a touring baritone inspired him to bring the poetry, passion, and historical authenticity of music to the world of business.  In urban real estate, Benaim sees unique opportunities\u2014the chance for us to follow our dreams, find love, nurture one another, and experience art in the everyday.  But when Covid-19 disrupted our lives, radically changing the way we use our private and public spaces, he faced a question: Are cities\u2014and the real estate industry that sustains them\u2014obsolete?  Benaim says no. The city is not dead. It is being reborn. Guided by a set of traditional values that prize fairness, honor, beauty, and respect for the communities in which he works, Benaim shares his wisdom through this lyrical story in four parts: I.

                "Wall Street Journal reporters and authors of The Club, Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg tell the riveting saga of how Formula 1 broke through in America, detailing the eclectic culture of racing obsessives, glamorous settings, gearheads, engineering geniuses, dashing racers, and bitter rivalries that have made F1 the world's fastest growing sport.    For decades in America, car racing meant NASCAR, and to a lesser extent IndyCar, with Formula 1\u2014the wealthiest racing league in the world\u2014a distant third. Fast forward to 2023, and F1 has emerged at the front of the pack powered by a passionate yet nascent American fanbase. The F1 juggernaut has arrived, but this checkered flag was far from inevitable.  In The Formula, Wall Street Journal reporters Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg tell the epic story of how F1 saved itself from collapse and finally conquered America through guile, fearlessness, and above all, reinvention. With fast cars, big money, glamorous locales, and beautiful people as the backdrop, The Formula reveals how F1's sudden arrival in the US was actually decades in the making, a product of the sport's near-constant state of transformation and experimentation. Bringing unique insight and access to F1's most storied teams and personalities\u2014from Ferrari to Bernie Ecclestone to Christian Horner to Lewis Hamilton\u2014The Formula offers a riveting portrait of the drivers, corporations, cars, rivalries, and audacious gambles that have shaped the sport for half a century.  The end result is a high-octane history of how modern F1 racing came to be\u2014the first book to tell the story of the outrageous successes and spectacular crashes that led F1 to this extraordinary yet precarious moment. More than just a sports story, The Formula is the tale of a disrupter that broke into the crowded American sports marketplace and claimed its place through cash, personality, and a new understanding of what a sport needs to be in the age of wall-to-wall entertainment.

In Individual Influence, authors Brian and Mary Smith go far beyond this axiom, making a persuasive case that even a company or team of individual players is still an \"Individual\" at its core\u2014expressing the collective influence of all those who play a role in it. Thus, there is not just one \"I\" in team, but many.  In the first installment of this series, readers will be led on a far-from-typical journey of self-discovery punctuated by often humorous stories and tangible steps to put the wisdom into practice.  Demonstrated through real-life experience working with and leading teams, the authors cover many transformative concepts, including:  How to be your best self so that your unique influence radiates from you  Reaping the benefits of slowing down and existing within the moment  How to delegate, hold accountable, define values, and achieve balance  Setting realistic success criteria for yourself and learning to celebrate small victories  Gaining more significant influence over your own conscious thoughts and reshaping your reality  Individual Influence revolutionizes the paradigm of traditional self-help books, presenting a clear, logical flow in implementing solutions to everyday challenges we face. It is a call for readers to discover who they are, and in doing so, there is a new world filled with unlimited possibilities waiting to be explored. "

                "Learn how to perform at your very best, from the psychologist who has advised elite military operators, Olympic medalists, big wave surfers, neurosurgeons, cliff divers, first responders, Cirque du Soleil acrobats, professional athletes and coaches, Fortune 500 business executives, and CIA analysts.    Learned Excellence is a comprehensive and practical guide to the mental disciplines of high performance, from the expert who developed the US Navy SEALs mental toughness curriculum and has worked with thousands of top athletes, elite military personnel, business executives, and first responders.   These stars perform across a wide variety of fields, but they all have something in common: when they are at work they know how to think clearly, stay focused, and shrug off setbacks under very high levels of stress. They may have superb physical and intellectual traits, but it is the stuff going on above the neck and between the ears that makes them excellent. The difference between settling and achieving, between good and great, between contentment and fulfillment, is based entirely on their mental approach.   This approach isn't innate; it is 100% learned. The world's top performers aren't born that way, they learn excellence. So can everyone else, and Dr. Eric Potterat can teach us.   One of the world's leading performance psychologists and a retired US Navy Commander, Dr. Potterat has spent over three decades helping thousands of top performers from the military, sports, first responder, and business worlds improve. He served as the lead psychologist for the US Navy SEALs and the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has consulted with the US Women's National Soccer team, the Miami Heat, Red Bull athletes, NASA astronauts, and dozens of Olympic medalists.  In Learned Excellence, Eric distills the insights he's learned into five mental disciplines for high performance\u2014Values & Goals, Mindset, Process, Adversity Tolerance, and Balance & Recovery. Illustrated with numerous stories and quotes, Learned Excellence features clear principles and practices that anyone can use to raise their game.   We are all performers, at work, at school, at home, and at life. Learned Excellence provides the roadmap to help each of us perform at our very best.

                "Positive influence (without authority) is the superpower that most people never learn to use at work.  Millions of subject-matter experts, functional leaders, requirements gatherers, and problem solvers have opportunities to influence every day. Instead, too often they merely respond to requests and take orders from their stakeholders. By not exercising their unknown superpower, they miss opportunities to break down silos, improve collaboration, and accelerate the best decisions for the organization. Organizations desperately need more positive leadership and influence to innovate, solve big challenges and develop healthy culture. If more people could discover how to use their superpower, they'd not only drive impact, but they would elevate their own perceived self-worth, leading to higher engagement and better mental and emotional wellbeing. What do people do instead of using their untapped superpower? When attempting to influence without much leverage, most people employ logical arguments and repeated pressure. They build a rational case and keep asking. But that rarely works. Facts, arguments and pressure don't work well trying to influence social/emotional creatures. As Dale Carnegie said, \"When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.\" This book is designed to help people discover the most impactful approach to influencing without authority, coercion, manipulation or force. It is a practical guide to influence that builds trust and relationships. It provides clear patterns and mental models, grounded in neuroscience, for communicating in a way that generates engagement, buy-in and cooperation. Anyone trying to influence without using \"leverage\" or \"control\" will benefit from this book. It's especially suited for influencing in today's fast-paced organizations where so many people have the ability to influence change, even if they don't have the biggest title or the most political capital. Other books on leadership, influence and trust, offer broad strategies, theories and truisms, but this book provides something more practical and applicable:  Proven mental models and communication patterns that can be utilized in nearly every communication.   It's based on Dale Carnegie Training's over 10-years of workshop, laboratory, and field testing with thousands of professionals across the world in multiple cultures and languages, from small organizations to large multi-national, from non-profit to for-profit, from government to the private sector.   It provides hands on structure and guidance for things like what to write in an email, how to ask the best question in a conversation to unlock new thinking, how to explain a controversial idea, and how to communicate when someone pushes back on you. If you want to learn to utilize your superpower of influence, you have to figure out how to. It's not self-help, it's how-to. "

Taylor Jr., SHRM-SCP, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)    A groundbreaking guide to mastering the job interview, offering proven advice and techniques to discover your unique interview style that is key to interviewing better\u2014for those on either side of the table.   Conventional interviewing advice doesn't work. That's what Anna Papalia learned through years of experience as an HR professional, consultant for Fortune 500 companies, and teacher at the Fox School of Business. None of the existing tools work for one simple reason: they don't get to the heart of what actually makes a great interview\u2014self-awareness. At its core, an interview is a set of questions about you. If you don't know yourself, you won't do well.  Determined to make the process better, more inclusive, and less obscure, Anna spent years researching how people interview and uncovered a new science to interviewing, rooted in the finding that there are four main styles people exhibit in an interview: you can be a Charmer, a Challenger, an Examiner, or a Harmonizer. Your style influences how you view and approach interviews, and ultimately how you perform in them. In Interviewology, Anna teaches you how to identify your individual style (and that of who you are interviewing with) and offers pragmatic tips for using this knowledge to nail your next interview.  Packed with wisdom, Interviewology offers clarity and a dynamic, scientifically validated approach that challenges everything you thought you knew about interviewing, providing unique insight into the process, debunking some of the most common myths, and explaining how you can perform better, whether you're applying for the job or looking for the right candidate.  Going beyond generic advice that isn't useful in the real world\u2014such as memorizing rote answers or strict guidelines\u2014Interviewology is a revolutionary approach that focuses on self-awareness\u2014and how to develop it\u2014to help everyone master their own unique interview style. It's about the power of knowing yourself and how that insight can lead to a more successful career and life.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

These are only a few titles Izek Shomof, the so-called King of Spring Street, has carried throughout his fascinating life. Each of these monikers tells a part of Izek's unbelievable tale, but the whole story has never been told\u2014until now.  Dreams Don't Die is not your typical, run-of-the-mill immigrant story. It is the memoir of a man who had every opportunity to take unethical and often-illegal shortcuts but who instead chose the lesser-trod path of honesty and integrity. It's the story of a young man who poured his blood, sweat, and tears into the city he loved, transforming not only buildings but lives in the process\u2014starting with his own.  From serving drinks in backroom Israeli casinos to buying an entire city block of downtown Los Angeles, Izek's life has been anything but traditional. Between flipping burger joints, building tract homes, and renovating historic California high-rises, Izek has come face-to-face with some particularly problematic elements of his family tree\u2014including organized crime, Mob enforcers, hit men, drug cartels, bank robbers, and history-making embezzlement schemes. The sordid adventures of Izek's family have even become the subject of not one but two film productions\u2014a major Hollywood motion picture starring James Caan and a blockbuster Israeli documentary series. Izek's life proves that even in the face of dream-killing obstacles, with hard work, steadfastness, and tenacity, dreams don't have to die. "

                "From small indignities to unconscious slights, women experience situations at work every day that may seem small or unimportant but that effectively differentiate and exclude them. These are micro-offenses; the small, awkward, or uncomfortable moments that slow-build until the unwelcome environment takes hold and women disengage. Situations the authors address range from things like use of the term \"girl\" versus \"woman,\" watching male colleagues leave work for a social event where women colleagues were left off the invite list, or hearing that a qualified woman shouldn't be offered an assignment because she has small children at home. You Should Smile More shows witnesses, allies, supervisors, and women at every level in their careers how to dismantle everyday gender bias, based upon the latest research, personal accounts, and interviews with professionals, both women and men. Widely known as a meme, the title itself is now a call-to-action against the very advice women so frequently hear from male colleagues or bosses. The authors spotlight these all-too-familiar moments, offering realistic strategies every witness can use to confront and productively address them. The information in this book finally advances women in the corporate workplace as equals and advances organizations on the path to creating cultures of true inclusion. "

Now, he reveals practical methods for using these inner resources to more readily enter an optimal state of high performance and satisfaction while avoiding burnout.    There are moments when we achieve peak performance: An athlete plays a perfect game; a business has a quarter with once-in-a-lifetime profits. But these moments are often elusive, and for every amazing day, we may have a hundred ordinary and even unsatisfying days. Fulfillment doesn't come from isolated peak experiences, but rather from many consistent good days. So how do we sustain performance, while avoiding burnout and maintaining balance?    In  Optimal, Daniel Goleman and Cary Cherniss reveal how emotional intelligence can help us have a great day, any day. They explain how to set a realistic, attainable goal of feeling satisfied that you've had a productive day \u2014 to consistently work at your 'optimal' level. Based on research of how hundreds of people build the inner architecture of having a good day, they sketch what an optimal state feels like, and show how emotional intelligence holds the key to our best performance.  Optimal is the culmination of decades of scientific discoveries bearing on emotional intelligence. Enhanced emotional intelligence pays off in improved engagement, productivity, and more satisfying days. In this book, you'll find the keys to competence in emotional intelligence, and practical methods for applying this skill set more readily. It will equip you to become a highly effective leader and enable you to build an organizational culture that empowers workers to sustain high performance. "

                "The Omnivore's Dilemma  meets  Fast Food Nation  from a global perspective in this game-changing look at the science, economics, and history of ultra-processed food and the industry's effect on our health and planet.  It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the food. How much of our daily caloric intake comes from ingesting substances that, technically speaking, do not meet traditional definitions of \u201cfood\u201d? Chances are, if you\u2019re eating something that came wrapped in plastic and contains a funky ingredient you don\u2019t have in your kitchen, it's most likely\u2014almost definitely\u2014ultra-processed food, or UPF. More than the principal obstacle to \u201ceating right,\u201d UPF has been linked to metabolic disease, depression, inflammation, anxiety, and cancer, while the production, distribution, and disposal of UPF and related products globally is known to cause devastating environmental damage. At the same time, UPF represents the dominant, nigh-unavoidable food culture for millions upon millions of eaters. Medical doctor and broadcaster Chris van Tulleken has spent his career trying to reframe the conversation around eating right, balancing the hard (and sometimes shocking) facts about what we're putting into our bodies with empathy for the natural desire to keep eating what we like, have time for, and can afford. As he argues in this book, we are all participants in an experiment we didn't consent to, one to determine how to get us to buy as much ultra-processed food as possible. It\u2019s not as simple as stumbling across the right diet trend, finding time to meal plan, or avoiding over-indulging in sugar, fat, or carbs or any other culprit. Nor is it a matter of individual will. It\u2019s about learning to live in \u201cthe third age of eating\u201d\u2014defined by the overwhelming abundance of ultra-processed eating options\u2014and arming yourself with the simple and not-so-simple facts that will help you make the choices that are right for you.
