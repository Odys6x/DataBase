Completed at the dawn of a new millennium, the feat electrified both the scientific community and the general public with its tantalizing promise of new and better treatments for countless diseases, including Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, and Parkinson's. Yet what is arguably the most important discovery of our time has also opened a Pandora's box of questions about who we are as humans and how the unique information stored in our genomes can and might be used, making it all the more important for everyone to understand the new science of genomics. In the CURIOSITY GUIDE TO THE HUMAN GENOME, Dr. John Quackenbush, a renowned scientist and professor, conducts a fascinating tour of the history and science behind the Human Genome Project and the technologies that are revolutionizing the practice of medicine today. With a clear and engaging narrative style, he demystifies the fundamental principles of genetics and molecular biology, including the astounding ways in which genes function, alone or together with other genes and the environment, to either sustain life or trigger disease. In addition, Dr. Quackenbush goes beyond medicine to examine how DNA-sequencing technology is changing how we think of ourselves as a species by providing new insights about our earliest ancestors and reconfirming our inextricable link to all life on earth. Finally, he explores the legal and ethical questions surrounding such controversial topics as stem cell research, prenatal testing, forensics, and cloning, making this volume of the Curiosity Guides series an indispensable resource for navigating our brave new genomic world.

What's gone wrong with our media? The answer: its owners. From William Randolph Hearst to Elon Musk, from the British press barons to colonial upstarts Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch, media proprietors have manipulated the news to accumulate wealth and influence as they meddled with democracy.   Eric Beecher knows the news business from bottom to top. He has been a journalist, editor and media proprietor (of Text Media and  Crikey ), with the rare distinction of having both worked for and been sued (unsuccessfully) by the Murdochs.   This book reveals the distorted role of the media moguls of the past two centuries: their techniques, strategies, behind-closed-doors machinations, and indulgent lifestyles. It explains how they have exploited the shield of the freedom of the press to undermine journalism \u2013 and truth.   In an era of fake news, AI and misinformation, this is democracy's chillingly important story: how a small coterie of flawed and narcissistic moguls created a shadow of power that has contributed to making the media an agent of mistrust.

But he demanded that the pilots stay on-board, refuel, and fly him to Mexico City. Just thirty minutes after the plane took off, the man jumped out of the aircraft and parachuted away...never to be seen or heard from again. Did he escape with the money? Did he even survive the jump? Over fifty years later, the FBI still does not know what happened to the man they call \"D. B. Cooper.\" Find out what we do know about one of America's most famous, unsolved mysteries in this book for young readers. "

                "At the first Boy Scout camp held by founder Robert Baden-Powell on Brownsea Island in 1907, the pioneer Boy Scouts were organised into four patrols and presented with a brass fleur-de-lis badge. They were then taught practical outdoor activities, such as knotting, tracking and camping, and tested on these skills. Upon passing the tests, each boy received a bronze badge in the shape of a scroll, featuring the words \u201cBe Prepared\u201d. The fleur-de-lis badge would later become the Scout\u2019s membership badge, also known as Tenderfoot, while the scroll badge became the Second Class Scout badge. This book compiles various collections of badges over the past century, from Boy Scouts and Wolf Cubs to Rover/Venture Scouts and adult Scouters. It also contains the collections of related accessories such as hat plumes and medals, as well as information about the history of Scouting. Informative and extensive, A Century of Scouting Badges is required reading for anyone with an interest in the Scouting movement and its story. "

                "This book is about the importance of nuclear disarmament and the work pursued by Alva Myrdal, a pioneering social activist, diplomat, cabinet minister, and disarmament negotiator. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982 together with Alfonso Garc\u00eda Robles \"for their work for disarmament and nuclear and weapon-free zones\". Prominent academics, politicians and practitioners have contributed reflections on Myrdal's achievements and their impact on the world today. Furthermore, a sample of Myrdal's own writings on nuclear disarmament are included, as well as significant speeches and a bibliography of her publications on nuclear matters.   Alva Myrdal was born in Uppsala,\u00a0Sweden, in 1902, graduated from college in Stockholm in 1924, and continued higher education at Uppsala University in the 1930s. She was a prolific author and reformer, specializing in social affairs, women's roles and nuclear disarmament. She was Sweden's Ambassador to India in the 1950s, for Nuclear Disarmament in the 1960s and 1970s, and a member of the Cabinet 1967-1973. Her most well-known works are \"The Game of Disarmament\" (1976), \"Nation and Family\" (1941), and \"Women's Two Roles\" (1956, with Viola Klein). Her book \"The Game of Disarmament\" (1976) is a key work in disarmament.   The Alva Myrdal Centre for Nuclear Disarmament was set up at Uppsala University in 2021 to contribute new ideas and concrete measures towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. Both editors are associated with the Centre, Professor Peter Wallensteen as a member of the board\u00a0and leader of one of its working groups,\u00a0and Dr. Armend Bekaj as a researcher.    - This book is relevant for students of international relations and policy-makers on issues of peace and conflict.    - It provides background documentation on the difficulties in achieving disarmament.   - It illustrates the significant role women can play to infuse new ideas into a men's world.  - It displays the importance of persistence, rationality, ingenuity and knowledge in furthering nuclear disarmament.    - It shows that Alva Myrdal's efforts can be an inspiration for new generations.

For many photographers, the results of their wide-angle attempts are a disappointment and they just can't seem to achieve that \"Wow\" they are hoping for in their images.   Whether you're new to wide-angle lenses or you've been frustrated by them for a long time, expert photographer, teacher, and author Chris Marquardt is here to help. Wide-Angle Photography is packed with information\u2014as well as beautiful and inspiring photography\u2014that will help you take your wide-angle image making to the next level.  In a friendly, accessible manner Chris walks you through in-depth discussions of both the advantages and the pitfalls of wide-angle photography, the fundamentals you need to know, composition and design principles, and the specific genres in which wide-angle lenses can be used to create outstanding images\u2014not only for landscape photography, but for portrait, street, architectural, and interior photography, as well. Throughout the book, Chris offers hands-on exercises that drive home the concepts being taught so you can learn by doing. Chris also dedicates two full chapters to tilt-shift lenses for those who are interested in exploring and maximizing the fascinating capabilities these kinds of lenses offer.  Topics include:  Types of lenses and filters  Understanding depth of field  Angles of view, crop factors, and focal lengths  Handling distortion and aberrations  Composition, design, and context  Point of view and perspective  Wide-angle for various genres  Panoramas and stitching images  Tilt-shift lenses  Hands-on exercises  And much more...

Bridging different literatures and reviewing in detail the impact of European regulation on the evolution of risk tolerance assessment, this book discusses the intersection of scholarly research, practitioner experience and current and likely normative developments.   In particular, the book focuses on the evolution of the debate on the suitability questionnaire - a key tool introduced with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and further developed with MiFID's successor - comparing it with empirical evidence on financial risk tolerance determinants, spanning from sociodemographic to behavioral components and life events.    The book also looks at the future evolution of the normative framework post MiFID2 addressing in detail two key trends that are already affecting the way in which risk tolerance is dealt with in European financial markets - sustainable development and fintech and roboadvisory.   The book includes an original survey run with financial market experts to assess the perceptions regarding these two trends and includes commentaries by a professional financial advisor on the key topics discussed.

                "Looking at a variety of armament sectors, the book examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts the fields of armament and arms control, how existing arms control measures will be affected by AI, and what new approaches based on AI have been or are currently developed.\u00a0 The significant increase in computing power, the increasing reliance on software, and the advent of (narrow) AI and deep-learning algorithms all have the potential to lead to disruptive changes for military operations and warfare, rendering many classical arms control instruments less effective, or even useless. On the other hand, AI might lead to completely new arms control approaches, raising the effectiveness and reliability of new verification measures. To provide a common understanding, the book starts by presenting a general introduction to the state of the art in artificial intelligence and arms control, and how the two topics are interrelated. The second part of the book looks at examples from various fields of weapon technology, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), conventional armament, and emerging technologies. The final section offers a cross-cutting perspective based on the examples presented in the second part. This volume will appeal to students and scholars of international relations, as well as policy-makers and practitioners interested in a better understanding of peace and security studies in general, and armament and arms control in particular with a strong focus on AI.

                "A celebration of trucks and trucking, from the first motorised wagons to the advent of driverless freight vehicles.  Charting decade after decade of innovation and change,  The Truck Book  is a beautifully illustrated history of trucks, trucking culture, and the romance of the open road. Trucks, lorries, and vans share their origins in the steam wagons of the late 1800s and the invention of the modern combustion engine in the 1870s. As steam power gave way to petrol and diesel engines, trucks evolved and diversified according to their desired purpose - becoming everything from panel vans and pick-up trucks to heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) or construction trucks like log carriers or concrete transporters. They have played a defining role in the wars of the last 100 years, saved lives as ambulances and fire engines, and even provided entertainment in the form of monster trucks.  In this book, you will find:   -Chapters showcasing every era's most important and iconic marques and models - from the Ford TT to the Bedford TM Turbo 92 Series to the Toyota Hilux. -Information about trucking culture, showing how trucks or trucking companies, such as UPS or Eddie Stobart, have won a place in fans' hearts. -Gallery pages providing a historical and global overview of key vehicles, from micro vans and pickups to American big rigs and earthmovers Weaving together photographic catalogues with specially commissioned \"visual tours\", feature pages on truck models, designers, and manufacturers, and milestone events or technological developments over the last 120 years,  The Truck Book  is the best-illustrated title available.

It's also a memoir, a love story, and a tale of high-flying stunts . . . An adventure toward and through fear.\"  \u2014   Southern Living     Tessa Fontaine's astonishing memoir of pushing past fear,  The Electric Woman , follows the author on a life-affirming journey of loss and self-discovery\u2014through her time on the road with the last traveling American sideshow and her relationship with an adventurous, spirited mother.   Turns out, one lesson applies to living through illness, keeping the show on the road, letting go of the person you love most, and eating fire:  The trick is there is no trick.   You eat fire by eating fire.   Two journeys\u2014a daughter's and a mother's\u2014bear witness to this lesson in  The Electric Woman .  For three years Tessa Fontaine lived in a constant state of emergency as her mother battled stroke after stroke. But hospitals, wheelchairs, and loss of language couldn't hold back such a woman; she and her husband would see Italy together, come what may. Thus Fontaine became free to follow her own piper, a literal giant inviting her to \"come play\" in the World of Wonders, America's last traveling sideshow. How could she resist?  Transformed into an escape artist, a snake charmer, and a high-voltage Electra, Fontaine witnessed the marvels of carnival life: intense camaraderie and heartbreak, the guilty thrill of hard-earned cash exchanged for a peek into the impossible, and, most marvelous of all, the stories carnival folks tell about themselves. Through these, Fontaine trained her body to ignore fear and learned how to keep her heart open in the face of loss.  A story for anyone who has ever imagined running away with the circus, wanted to be someone else, or wanted a loved one to live forever,  The Electric Woman  is ultimately about death-defying acts of all kinds, especially that ever constant: good old-fashioned unconditional love.
