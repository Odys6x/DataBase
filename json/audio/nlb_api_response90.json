                "Brought to you by Penguin.  Years have passed since the clash of shieldwalls echoed across the land. The Saxons are now the lords of Britain. And yet the bards still sing of Arthur - 'In our darkest time, when we need him most, shall he come again.' Yet old Beran has no love of bards' songs. Nor of people, unless they are paying him to steal or kill. He is a mercenary, in the employ of the cutthroat Nabor ap Nabor, and he has been ordered to murder a boy fleeing a burning city. No ordinary boy either. No, this boy is the son of King Constantine and the grandson of High King Ambrosius. And he could be the hope of Britain . . . if he lives. Betraying his companions and returning to a world he thought he had left forever, Beran gives his word that he will take the boy to the one place that still holds out against the Saxons: Camelot. Crossing a hostile land, they will meet the runaway lovers, Tristan and Isolde. They will seek the help of Guivret, called the Little King, and the Saracen, Palamedes, who once rode beneath Arthur's banner. Hunted by Saxons, Nabor ap Nabor, and Queen Morgana, this unlikely band must fight for their lives and for each other. For if there's to be any hope for Britain, Beran must deliver the boy to Camelot. But to do that, he must also face his own past . . . \u00a92024 Giles Kristian (P)2024 Penguin Audio. "

It\u2019s been five weeks since Io left Alante to follow the golden thread, and she\u2019s no closer to finding the god on the other end. She spends her days in constant, grueling travel and her nights worrying over the fate-thread she shares with Edei\u2014which seems to be fraying. Making matters worse, she and Bianca soon realize that their only lead has shaken them off, snapped the golden thread, and disappeared. But not before Io gathers some crucial clues. Her investigation leads her to a new mystery, a rash of sibling disappearances across the Wastelands that seems to be connected to the murders in Alante. And all signs point to Nanzy, the golden city, as the center of the whole conspiracy. As Io and Bianca make their way to Nanzy, they face powerful enemies, find allies new and old, and uncover a horrifying plot that traces back centuries. The more Io learns, the more she begins to suspect that the future of the world may truly rest on her shoulders. But she will have to determine how much of the future is her choice\u2014and how much is simply her fate. "

Ava Baldwin has always tried to keep her anger in check, just like her mom taught her. But when know-it-all classmate Owen King tries to speak over her yet again, Ava explodes . . . and Owen freezes, becoming totally unresponsive.  Although Owen recovers, Ava's parents whisk her off to her mother's alma mater, the Accademia del Forte, a mysterious international boarding school in Venice. There, Ava and her brother, Jax, discover that the Olympian gods founded the Accademia to teach the descendants of mythological monsters how to control their emotions and their powers and become functioning, well-adjusted members of society.  But not everything at the Accademia is as it seems. After her friend Fia is almost expelled for challenging a teacher, Ava realizes the school is hiding a dangerous secret. To uncover the truth, Ava and her new friends embark on an adventure that could change the way they view history, mythology\u2014and themselves\u2014forever...or end their lives.

A touch cozy fantasy and a touch horror, The Dollmakers is perfect for fans of Studio Ghibli films, the works of TJ Klune and Travis Baldree, and readers of Juniper & Thorn and The Goblin Emperor.   In the country called One, dollmakers are vital members of the community. An artisan's doll is the height of society's accomplishments, while a guard's doll is the only thing standing between the people of One and the Shod: vicious, cobbled monstrosities that will tear apart any structure\u2014living or dead, inanimate or otherwise\u2014to add to their horde.  Apprentice Shean of Pearl is a brilliant dollmaker. With her clever dolls, she intends to outsmart and destroy the Shod, once and for all\u2014a destiny she's worked her whole life toward accomplishing. But when the time comes for her dolls to be licensed, she's told her work is too beautiful and delicate to fight. A statement that wounds and infuriates her; the Shod killed everyone she loved. How could her fate be anything but fighting them?  In an attempt to help her see a new path for herself, Shean's mentor sends her on a journey to the remote village called Web, urging her to glean some wisdom from Ikiisa, a reclusive and well-respected guard dollmaker. But Shean has another plan: if she can convince the village of Web of her talents, the Licensor Guild will have to reconsider and grant her a guard's license. And what better way to convince them than challenging Ikiisa and instating herself as the official dollmaker of Web? Once she's done that, proving her dolls' worth in the fight against the Shod will be simple.  As simple, that is, as calling the Shod to Web... "

                "In this sly and dazzling contemporary fantasy, the most notorious nine-tailed fox in Korea pairs up with a trickster god\u2013turned\u2013detective to track down a wrathful demon\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0before it can destroy the mortal world.    \u201cEnchanting fantasy . . . With an intoxicating mix of action, mystery, and deliciously angsty romance, this reads like the most bingeable K-drama.\u201d\u2014 Publishers Weekly  (starred review)  Kim Hani has retired from a life of devouring souls. She is, simply put, too full. Once known as the infamous Scarlet Fox, she now spends her days working in a coffee shop and annoying a particularly irritating, if unfairly handsome, trickster god as often as she can.  That god is Seokga the Fallen. Exiled from the heavenly kingdom of Okhwang, he now begrudgingly resides in the mortal realm, working toward his redemption and suffering through his interactions with the particularly infuriating, if sneakily charming, gumiho barista at his favorite caf\u00e9.\u00a0  But when a powerful demon escapes from the underworld and threatens to end all of humanity, Okhwang\u2019s emperor offers Seokga an enticing bargain: Kill this rogue creature, as well as the legendary and elusive Scarlet Fox, and he will be reinstated as a god. Hani, however, has no intention of being caught. Seokga might be a trickster god, but she has a trick of her own that he\u2019ll never see coming: teaming up. As Seokga\u2019s assistant, Hani will undermine and sabotage his investigation right under his overly pointy nose. Sure, she\u2019ll help him kill the demon, but she certainly won\u2019t allow him to uncover her secret identity while they\u2019re at it.  As the bickering partners track their case down a path of mayhem and violence, the god and the gumiho find themselves inescapably drawn to each other. But will the unlikely couple stand together to prevent the apocalypse, or will they let their secrets tear them\u2014and the world\u2014apart?. "

Many years ago, Odysseus sailed to war and never returned. For twenty years his wife Penelope and the women of Ithaca have guarded the isle against suitors and rival kings. But peace cannot be kept forever, and the balance of power is about to break . . .  A beggar has arrived at the Palace. Salt-crusted and ocean-battered, he is scorned by the suitors - but Penelope recognises in him something terrible: her husband, Odysseus, returned at last. Yet this Odysseus is no hero. By returning to the island in disguise, he is not merely plotting his revenge against the suitors - vengeance that will spark a civil war - but he's testing the loyalty of his queen. Has she been faithful to him all these years? And how much blood is Odysseus willing to shed to be sure?  The song of Penelope is ending, and the song of Odysseus must ring through Ithaca's halls. But first, Penelope must use all her cunning to win a war for the fate of the island and keep her family alive, whatever the cost... "

I loved this book.\u201d \u2013 Kelly Link, Pulitzer Prize finalist and bestselling author of  Get in Trouble  and  The Book of Love  \u201cWhat\u00a0I love most about  Ninetails  is its fierce allegiance\u00a0to underdogs of all kinds, its careful\u00a0and myriad\u00a0empathy\u00a0for its characters, but also its pure and artisanal\u00a0delight in language and fictive possibilities.\u201d \u2014Ocean Vuong,  New York Times -bestselling author of  On Earth, We're Briefly Gorgeous  and  Time is a Mother  A \u201clyrical and virtuosic\u201d fabulist debut collection of stories re-imagining the nine-tailed fox spirit of Asian folklore (Gina Chung).  A fox spirit avenges a teen girl by seducing her abuser. A shapeshifting woman finds herself chased through the woods by fox hunters; meanwhile, an assassination plot called Operation Fox Hunt unfolds against the last Queen of Korea. Chinese migrants hoping to make new lives as \u201cpaper children\u201d in America find their pasts\u2014and their hopes for the future\u2014embodied in the foxes that haunt the harbor in 1900s Angel Island. In the nine tales of  Ninetails,  acclaimed poet Sally Wen Mao reimagines the fox spirit from Asian folklore\u2014a shapeshifter, shaman, and seductress\u2014as an icon of vengeance, solidarity and liberation. The characters of her stories are varied\u2014from silicone sex dolls who come to life with new purpose, to women whose crushes manifest as stones\u2014but they all reach for a common purpose: to find truth and belonging in a difficult world determined to consider them alien. With the fabulist vibrancy of Carmen Maria Machado, the sinuous world-building of Helen Oyeyemi, and the sensuous feminist rage of Han Kang,  Ninetails  is both timeless\u2014unearthing a cultural icon whose origins date back over a thousand years\u2014and timely in its contemporary political urgency.

Now he's tasked with a deadly mission: find the legendary witch Baba Jaga. To reach her, Dymitr must ally with the ones he's sworn to kill. Pain is Ala's inheritance. A fear-eating zmora with little left to lose, Ala awaits death from the curse she carries. When Dymitr offers her a cure in exchange for her help, she has no choice but to agree. Together they must fight against time and the wrath of the Chicago underworld. But Dymitr's secrets\u2014and his true motives\u2014may be the thing that actually destroys them.  \"Lovely, lush, and full of otherworldly longing, this modern fairytale about righteousness and the weight we bear for love is Roth at her most imaginative and ethereal.\"\u2014Olivie Blake,  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Atlas Six    A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books.

                "The very first thriller from Rick Riordan Presents! Drawing from the darkest corners of Caribbean mythology, acclaimed author Sarah Dass crafts a chilling tale of magic, murder, and how far we'll go to protect what's ours\u2014perfect for fans of Angeline Boulley and Tiffany D. Jackson. Unlike the other residents of the small Caribbean Island of St. Virgil, Selina DaSilva does not believe in magic. With a logical mind and a knack for botany, Selina used to dream of leaving the island to study Pharmacology\u2014until a vicious, unsolved attack left her father dead and her mother in a coma. Now her guilt over her mother's condition keeps her tethered to the island, relegated to conning gullible tourists with useless talismans and phony protection rituals. But when one of those tourists ends up at the center of a string of strange murders, the truth that Selina has been denying can no longer be avoided: there is evil lurking in the forests that surround St. Virgil. Another thing that can't be avoided? Selina's ex-boyfriend Gabriel, newly employed at the local newspaper and eager to put his investigative skills to use. Desperate to put an end to the killings and claim justice for Selina's family, these two former lovers race to find answers. But evil bides its time. And as long-buried feelings and long-hidden secrets about Selina's family's past begin to reveal themselves, only one answer remains\u2014and it waits in the forest.

Overworked, buried in debt, she senses the life she wanted slipping away\u2014while the world around her veers badly off course, hurtling toward economic and ecological collapse. She wants to find something better. But she has no idea where to start.\u00a0 In a sudden and unprecedented burst of rebellion, Jane decides to abandon everything she knows, leaving behind her relationships and responsibilities to go on the road. That\u2019s how she meets Barry, a brilliant and charismatic recluse living on an isolated homestead near New York\u2019s Canadian border. For years, in secret, Barry\u2019s chased an unlikely obsession: to build a pair of wings humans can fly in, with designs inspired by an obscure precursor to the Wright Brothers. It\u2019s no mere hobby. He\u2019s convinced his dream of flight will spark a revolution, delivering us from the degradation of modern capitalism and the climate chaos that awaits us.\u00a0 Jane is captivated by Barry\u2019s radical vision, even as his experiments become more dangerous. But she\u2019s equally drawn to the enigmatic Ike, Barry\u2019s gentle, thoughtful son, who\u2019s known no other reality\u2014and who only wants to keep his father alive, tethered to ground and to reason.\u00a0 So begins an inventive, dazzlingly beautiful story about the human desire for transcendence\u2014our longing to escape the mundane and glide into a euphoric future. Inspired by the myth of Daedalus and Icarus,  The Sky Was Ours  is a powerful and imaginative debut that explores the question: If you had access to technology that allowed you to escape the confines of your life, would you use it? And if Barry\u2019s wings really could change the world, would that be freedom?. "

Ganga, joyful goddess of the river, serves as caretaker to the mischievous godlings who roam her banks. But when their antics incur the wrath of a powerful sage, Ganga is cursed to become mortal, bound to her human form until she fulfills the obligations of the curse.

But in a cruel turn of fate, just as she is freed of her binding, she is forced to leave her infant son behind.  Her son, prince Devavrata, unwittingly carries the legacy of Ganga's curse. And when he makes an oath that he will never claim his father's throne, he sets in motion a chain of events that will end in a terrible and tragic war.  As the years unfold, Ganga and Devavrata are drawn together again and again, each confluence another step on a path that has been written in the stars, in this deeply moving and masterful tale of duty, destiny, and the unwavering bond between mother and son.

Thirteen years ago, Sylvia Gray's young daughter, Faye, attacked her babysitter in order to impress the Kingman, a monster she and her best friend had encountered on the Internet. When the now twenty-three-year-old Faye goes missing, leaving her toddler behind, Sylvia launches a search that propels her back into the past and back into the Kingman's orbit. With the help of her estranged husband and a sister she hasn't spoken to in years, Sylvia draws dangerously closer not only to Faye, but also to the truth about the monster that once inspired her. Will Sylvia be able to reach her daughter before history repeats itself? Or will it be Sylvia, this time, who loses her grip on reality and succumbs to the dark powers of this monstrous fiction? Both literary and suspenseful,  Monsters We Have Made  confronts the terrors of parenthood and examines the boundaries of love. Most importantly, it reminds us of the power of stories to shape our lives. "

Elmore Trent is a professor of Indigenous studies who finds himself entangled in an affair that's ruining his marriage; Paul North plays in the IHL (Indigenous Hockey League), struggling to keep up with the game that's passing him by; Detective Ruby Birch is chasing a string of gruesome murders, with clues that conspicuously lead her to both Elmore and Paul. And then there's Fabiola Halan, former journalist-turned-author and famed survivor of a plane crash that sparked a nationwide tour promoting her book.\u00a0 What starts off as a series of subtle connections between isolated characters quickly takes a menacing turn, as it becomes increasingly clear that someone\u2014or something\u2014is hunting them all. Taking tropes from the murder mystery, police procedural, thriller, and horror genres, Drew Hayden Taylor weaves a pulse-pounding and propulsive narrative with an intricate cast of characters, while never losing the ability to make you laugh.

                "Best-selling author Rick Riordan presents best-selling author Stacey Lee's modern reimagining of a classic Chinese folktale\u2014replete with magic, boba, and lots of trash talking. Twelve-year-old Winston Chu is supposed to learn impulse control at the cooking academy his mom enrolled him in. But learning to think before he acts won't happen overnight. While skateboarding home with a pie in hand, Winston inadvertently stops a robbery at Mr. Pang's Whimsies, an oddities shop in Chinatown. As a reward, Mr. Pang invites Winston to choose any item in the store. But the strange old man warns Winston to browse carefully, for the first thing Winston touches will be the thing he gets. Before Winston can decide, a magpie flies under a shelf, and he impulsively grabs an old broom to sweep it out. Mr. Pang hands him the broom, along with a dustpan. \"Two for one. Congratulations.\" Deflated, Winston returns home, determined to put the broom incident behind him. Or at least in the closet. But when some of his most beloved possessions go missing, all Winston can think about are the broom and dustpan. Did they somehow take his stuff? And what\u2014or who\u2014will they dispose of next? It's time to break into Mr. Pang's Whimsies, where clearly there's more going on than meets the far-seeing eyeball. It's time to fight magic with magic. And this time, Winston better have a plan. Endorsed by Rick Riordan, author of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, soon to be a series on Disney+.

                "\"Every once in a while, a book comes along that drops you into another world and takes you places you never could imagine. This is that book. An astounding accomplishment!\"  \u2014 R. L. Stine , author of\u00a0 Goosebumps  Set in 19th century Sri Lanka and inspired by local folklore, the daughter of a traditional demon-priest\u2014relentlessly bullied by peers and accused of witchcraft herself\u2014tries to solve the mysterious attacks that have been terrorizing her coastal village.  Being the daughter of the village Capuwa, or demon-priest, Amara is used to keeping mostly to herself. Influenced by the new religious practices brought in by the British Colonizers, the villagers who once\u00a0respected her father\u2019s craft have turned on the family. Yet, they all still seem to call on him whenever supernatural disturbances arise. Now someone\u2014or  something \u2014is viciously seizing upon men in the jungle. But instead of enlisting Amara\u2019s father\u2019s help, the villages have accused him of carrying out the attacks himself. As she tries to clear her father\u2019s name, Amara finds herself haunted by dreams that eerily predict the dark forces on her island. And she can\u2019t shake the feeling that it\u2019s all connected to the night she was recovering from a strange illness, and woke up, scared and confused, to hear her mother\u2019s frantic cries:  No one can find out what happened .

Her tone and words transport us.\" \u2014 San Francisco Chronicle  on  The Night Tiger  Some people think foxes are similar to ghosts because we go around collecting  qi ,   but nothing could be further than the truth. We are living creatures, just like you,   only usually better looking . . .  Manchuria, 1908. In the last years of the dying Qing Empire, a courtesan is found frozen in a doorway. Her death is clouded by rumors of foxes, which are believed to lure people by transforming themselves into beautiful women and handsome men. Bao, a detective with an uncanny ability to sniff out the truth, is hired to uncover the dead woman's identity. Since childhood, Bao has been intrigued by the fox gods, yet they've remained tantalizingly out of reach\u2014until, perhaps, now. Meanwhile, a family who owns a famous Chinese medicine shop can cure ailments but can't escape the curse that afflicts them\u2014their eldest sons die before their twenty-fourth birthdays. When a disruptively winsome servant named Snow enters their household, the family's luck seems to change\u2014or does it? Snow is a creature of many secrets, but most of all she's a mother seeking vengeance for her lost child. Hunting a murderer, she will follow the trail from northern China to Japan, while Bao follows doggedly behind. Navigating the myths and misconceptions of fox spirits, both Snow and Bao will encounter old friends and new foes, even as more deaths occur.  New York Times  bestselling author Yangsze Choo brilliantly explores a world of mortals and spirits, humans and beasts, and their dazzling intersection. Epic in scope and full of singular, unforgettable characters,  The Fox Wife  is a stunning novel about old loves and second chances, the depths of maternal love, and ancient folktales that may very well be true.

The stories in  Fifty Beasts to Break Your Heart  are about the abomination that resides within us all. That churning, clawing, ravenous yearning: the hunger to be held, and seen, and known. And the terror, too: to be loved too well, or not enough, or for long enough. To be laid bare before your sweetheart, to their horror. To be recognized as the monstrous thing you are. Two teenage girls working at a sinister roadside attraction called the Eternal Staircase explore its secrets\u2014and their own doomed summer love. A zombie rooster plays detective in a missing persons case. A woman moves into a new house with her acclaimed artist boyfriend\u2014and finds her body slowly shifting into something specially constructed to accommodate his needs and whims. A pack of middle schoolers turn to the occult to rid themselves of a hated new classmate. And a pair of outcasts, a vampire and a goat woman, find solace in each other, even as the world's lack of understanding might bring about its own end. In these lush, strange, beautifully written stories, GennaRose Nethercott explores human longing in all its diamond-dark facets to create a collection that will redefine what you see as a beast, and make you beg to have your heart broken.

                "For fans of  Ariadne  ,  a spellbinding debut fantasy about a human who gets trapped with the god of Autumn, who brings with him life-threatening danger and a forbidden romance.   Under the right circumstances, would even a god fall?   Tirne is one of four humans rigorously selected to usher the turn of the seasons into the mortal world. Every year, she escorts the taciturn god Autumn between the godly and human realms. Autumn's seasonal stay among mortals brings cooler weather, changing leaves, and the harvest of apples and gourds until Winter takes his place. This year, the enchanted Mirror that separates their worlds shatters after Tirne and Autumn pass through, trapping both of them in the human realm. As the endless autumn stretches on, crops begin to fail and the threat of starvation looms. Away from the magic of the gods' home, Tirne suffers debilitating headaches that return with a vengeance. Worse, Autumn's extended stay in the human realm turns him ever more mortal and vulnerable, stirring a new, forbidden attraction to Tirne. While the priesthood scrambles to find a way to reassemble the Mirror, Tirne digs into the temple's secrets and finds an unlikely ally\u2014or enemy\u2014in the enigmatic sorcerer and master of poisons, Sidriel. Thrown into a world of mystery, betrayal, and espionage as she searches for the truth, might Tirne lose her morals, her hard-earned position, and the illicit spark between her and Autumn?

                "In this middle grade rom-com sprinkled with a dash of magic, a girl uses her newfound ability to make people fall in love to sabotage her rival.  Erin Johnson's thirteenth birthday unfolds like any other day, from her mom's quirky and embarrassing choice of outfit to racing her nemesis, Trevor Jin, to the best seat in class\u2014front row, center. But her gifts this year include something very out of the ordinary: magical powers.   Erin discovers her mysterious father is actually the love god Cupid and she's inherited his knack for romance. It's not the most useful ability for an overachiever with lofty academic and extracurricular goals...or is it? Erin desperately wants to be elected president of the Multicultural Leadership Club, and as usual, Trevor is her fiercest competition. He's never backed down from a challenge before, but if Erin makes him fall in love with her, maybe he'd drop out of the race and let her win.   With her magical pedigree, wrapping Trevor around her finger is a snap, and having him around all the time is a small price to pay for victory. But without their cutthroat rivalry bringing out the worst in each other, Erin realizes Trevor may not be as bad as she thought, and suddenly her first foray into love gets a lot more complicated...

                "An action-filled reimagining of the famous Greek myth, Jason and the Golden Fleece, brilliantly told by classicist Mark Knowles. He has come to take what is yours... Iolkos, Thessaly. 1230 BC. King Pelias has grown paranoid, tormented by his murderous past and a prophecy of the man who will one day destroy him.When a stranger arrives to compete in the Games of Poseidon, Pelias is horrified, for this young man should never have grown to manhood. He is Jason, Pelias' nephew, who survived his uncle's assassins as a child. Now Jason wants his revenge \u2013 and the kingdom.But Pelias is cunning as well as powerful. He gives his foe an impossible challenge: to claim the throne, Jason must first steal the fabled Golden Fleece of Colchis.Jason assembles a band of Greece's finest warriors. They are the Argonauts, named for their trusty ship. But even with these mighty allies, Jason will have to overcome the brutal challenges hurled his way. His mission and many lives depend on his wits \u2013 and his sword.PRAISE FOR 'ARGO' AND MARK KNOWLES: 'Mark Knowles has taken the legend of Jason and the Golden Fleece, and stripped it down to its bare bones... What is left is a deeply researched historical epic, so brilliantly brought to life I could taste the salt air on my tongue... Epic battles, well-rounded characters sailing through a brilliantly described world' -Adam Lofthouse, author of 'The Centurion's Son''What a spectacular triumph! Knowles has taken a reassuringly familiar legend and elevated it into a new, realistic and engrossing story' -Sam Taw'[Knowles] has teamed his love of learning classics and childhood love of sword-and-sandals epics to accomplish something remarkable' -Boarding Schools' Association- "

Shadow bruja Ren Santiago was relentlessly pursued by the evil Aztec Lords of Night, who claimed that she was destined to be their queen, a destiny she wasn't willing to accept. So she chose death instead. Too bad death wasn't the answer to her problems. Ren soon realizes she must return to the land of the living to make things right. Unfortunately, that means negotiating with Ixtab, queen of the underworld. Ixtab offers her ten days aboveground in exchange for the discarded crown of jade and shadow. If Ren fails, she will return to the darkness for eternity. Ren agrees, knowing full well that she also has to save her friends Marco, Monty, and Edison and, while she's at it, put those pesky Lords of Night back to sleep forever. The only problem is, Ren lost her shadow magic and time rope when she lost her life. How will Ren manage to accomplish what feels impossible? The answer lies not in manipulating shadows or time, but in recognizing the awesome power that has always been inside her. J. C. Cervantes's trademark humor, incredibly high stakes, fascinating characters, and shocking plot twists are on full display in this epic conclusion of an unputdownable duology. "

Goyer, executive producer of  Sandman  and  Foundation   When Byron Kidd\u2019s twelve-year-old daughter vanishes, the only clue is a note claiming that she\u2019s taken off to explore the Hidden World, a magical land from a series of popular novels. She is not the only child to seek out this imaginary realm in recent years, and Byron\u2014a cynical and hard-nosed reporter\u2014is determined to discover the whereabouts of dozens of missing kids.  Byron secures a high-profile interview with Annabelle Tobin, the eccentric author of the books, and heads off to her palatial home in the Hollywood Hills.

On the isle of Ithaca, queen Penelope maintains a delicate balance of power. Many years ago, her husband Odysseus sailed to war with Troy and never came home. In his absence, Penelope uses all her cunning to keep the peace\u2014a peace that is shattered by the return of Orestes, King of Mycenae, and his sister Elektra.  Orestes' hands are stained with his mother's blood. Not so long ago, the son of Agamemnon took Queen Clytemnestra's life on Ithaca's sands. Now, wracked with guilt, he is slowly losing his mind. But a king cannot be seen to be weak, and Elektra has brought him to Ithaca to keep him safe from the ambitious men of Mycenae.  Penelope knows destruction will follow in his wake as surely as the furies circle him. His uncle Menelaus, the battle-hungry king of Sparta, longs for Orestes' throne\u2014and if he can seize it, no one will be safe from his violent whims.  Trapped between two mad kings, Penelope fights to keep her home from being crushed by a war that stretches from Mycenae and Sparta to the summit of Mount Olympus itself. Her only allies are Elektra, desperate to protect her brother, and Helen of Troy, Menelaus' wife. And watching over them all is the goddess Aphrodite, who has plans of her own.  Each woman has a secret. And their secrets will shape the world. "

We were taught how to get everything we wanted in this world, everything men always kept for themselves: power, wealth, and prestige. And with a touchingly tragic past and the help of some highly illegal spells, I would become a princess, secure our fortunes, and we would all live happily ever after.  But there\u2019s always more to the story. With my magic running out, war looming, and a handsome hostage prince\u2014the  wrong  prince\u2014distracting me from my true purpose with his magnetic charm and forbidden flirtations, I\u2019m in danger of losing control of the delicate balance I\u2019ve created . . . and that could prove fatal.  There\u2019s so much more riding on this than a crown. "

                "A brilliant new voice brings a brilliant new novel: debut author Ehigbor Okosun's first book in an action-packed, poignant duology inspired by Nigerian mythology\u2014full of magic and emotion and set in a highly atmospheric, complex world in which a young woman fights to survive a tyrannical society, having everything stripped away from her, and seeks vengeance for her mother's murder and the spilled blood of her people.   In the midst of a tyrannical regime and political invasion, D\u00e8mi just wants to survive: to avoid the suspicion of the nonmagical Ajes who occupy her ancestral homeland of Ife; to escape the King's brutal genocide of her people\u2014the darker skinned, magic wielding Oluso; and to live peacefully with her secretive mother while learning to control the terrifying blood magic that is her birthright.  But when D\u00e8mi's misplaced trust costs her mother's life, survival gives way to vengeance. She bides her time until the devious Lord Ekwensi grants her the perfect opportunity\u2014kidnap the Aje prince, Jonas, and bargain with his life to save the remaining Oluso. With the help of her reckless childhood friend Colin, D\u00e8mi succeeds, but discovers that she and Jonas share more than deadly secrets; every moment tangles them further into a forbidden, unmistakable attraction, much to Colin's\u2014and D\u00e8mi's\u2014distress.  The kidnapping is now a joint mission: to return to the King, help get Lord Ekwensi on the council, and bolster the voice of the Oluso in a system designed to silence them. But the way is dangerous, D\u00e8mi's magic is growing yet uncertain, and it's not clear if she can trust the two men at her side.  A tale of rebellion and redemption, race and class, love and trust and betrayal, Forged by Blood is epic fantasy at its finest, from an enthusiastic, emerging voice.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

The end of the story is only the beginning\u2026  Even before they were transformed into Gorgons, Medusa, Stheno, and Euryale were unique among their immortal family.\u00a0Curious about mortals and their lives, Medusa and her sisters entered the human world in search of a place to belong, yet quickly found themselves at the perilous center of a dangerous Olympian rivalry and learned\u2014too late\u2014that a god's love is a violent one. \u00a0Forgotten by history and diminished by poets, the other two Gorgons have never been more than horrifying hags, damned and doomed. But they were sisters first, and their journey from lowly sea-born origins to the outskirts of the pantheon is a journey that rests, hidden, underneath their scales. \u00a0Monsters, but not monstrous, Stheno and Euryale will step into the light for the first time to tell the story of how all three sisters lived and were changed by each other, as they struggle against the inherent conflict between sisterhood and individuality, myth and truth, vengeance and peace.

This is why farmers have daughters. A fifteen-year-old teenager is the backbone of her small Midwestern family, budgeting the household finances and raising her younger brother while her mom, a talented artist, weaves beautiful tapestries. For six years, it's been just the three of them\u2014her mom has brought home guests at times, but none have ever stayed. But when her mom brings home a six-foot-tall crane with a menacing air, the girl is powerless to stop him forcing his way into their lives and her mom's heart. Utterly enchanted and numb to his sharp edges, she abandons the world around her to weave the masterpiece the crane demands. In this stunning contemporary retelling of \"The Crane Wife\" by the author of When Women Were Dragons and The Girl Who Drank the Moon, a fiercely pragmatic teen forced to grow up faster than was fair will do whatever it takes to protect her family\u2014and change the story.

This is a golden treasury of over one hundred English folktales captured in the form they were first collected in past centuries. Listen to these classic tales as they would have been told when storytelling was a living art-when the audience believed in boggarts and hobgoblins, local witches and will-o'-the-wisps, ghosts and giants, cunning foxes and royal frogs. Find \"Jack the Giantkiller\", \"Tom Tit Tot\", and other quintessentially English favorites, alongside interesting borrowings, such as an English version of the Grimms' \"Little Snow White\"-as well as bedtime frighteners, including \"Captain Murderer\", as told to Charles Dickens by his childhood nurse. Neil Philip has provided a full introduction and source notes on each story that illustrate each tale's journey from mouth to page, and what has happened to them on the way. These tales rank among the finest English short stories of all time in their richness of metaphor and plot and their great verbal dash and daring. "

Schwab   Who said true love is a myth?  A prophecy claims that Psyche, princess of Mycenae, will defeat a monster feared even by the gods. Rebelling against her society's expectations for women, Psyche spends her youth mastering blade and bow, preparing to meet her destiny.  When Psyche angers the love goddess Aphrodite, she sends Eros, god of desire, to deliver a cruel curse. After eons watching humanity twist his gifts, the last thing Eros wants is to become involved in the chaos of the mortal world. But when he pricks himself with the arrow intended for Psyche, Eros finds himself doomed to yearn for a woman who will be torn from him the moment their eyes meet.  Thrown together by fate, headstrong Psyche and world-weary Eros will face challenges greater than they could have ever imagined. And as the Trojan War begins and divine powers try to keep them apart, the pair must determine if the curse could become something more . . . before it's too late.  A joyous and subversive tale of gods, monsters, and the human heart and soul, Psyche and Eros dazzles the senses while exploring notions of trust, sacrifice, and what it truly means to be a hero.

                "Brought to you by Penguin.    As for queens, they are either hated or forgotten. She already knows which option suits her best . . .    Perfect for fans of ARIADNE and THE SONG OF ACHILLES, this is the    extraordinary retelling of history's most infamous heroine.   Mother. Monarch. Murderer. Magnificent.  You are born to a king, but marry a tyrant. You stand helplessly as he sacrifices your child to placate the gods. You watch him wage war on a foreign shore and comfort yourself with violent thoughts of your own. You play the part, fooling enemies who deny you justice. Slowly, you plot.  You are Clytemnestra.  But when the husband who owns you returns in triumph, what then? Acceptance or vengeance - infamy follows both. So you bide your time and wait, until you might force the gods' hands and take revenge. Until you rise. For you understood something that the others don't. If power isn't given to you, you have to take it for yourself.  A blazing novel set in the world of Ancient Greece and told through the eyes of its greatest heroine, this is a thrilling tale of power and prophecies, of hatred, love, and of an unforgettable Queen who fiercely dealt out death to those who wronged her.   \"Vivid with fury, passion and strength, this is a fabulous myth retelling\" Jennifer Saint \"A powerhouse of a novel. Clytemnestra's rage, heartbreak and determination radiate off the page\" Elodie Harper   \"Rivals House of the Dragon in conspiracies and feminine brutality. An electrifying read\" Elizabeth Fremantle \"Redefines the mythical retelling genre with a warrior queen who, instead of enduring suffering, avenges it\" Annie Garthwaite   \u00a92023 Costanza Casati (P)2023 Penguin Audio.

                "\"Could you love me?\" he whispered. The question stole my breath and burned my lungs in the silence that followed. I wanted to answer, to whisper yes into the space between us, but I was afraid. All Gesela's life, her home village of Elk has been cursed. And it isn't a single curse-it is one after another, each to be broken by a villager, each with devastating consequences. When Elk's well goes dry, it is Gesela's turn to save her town by killing the toad that lives at the bottom. Except . . . the toad is not a toad at all. He is an Elven prince under a curse of his own, and upon his death, his brothers come for Gesela, seeking retribution. As punishment, the princes banish Gesela to live with their seventh brother, the one they call the beast. Gesela expects to be the prisoner of a hideous monster, but the beast turns out to be exquisitely beautiful, and rather than lock her in a cell, he offers Gesela a deal. If she can guess his true name in seven days, she can go free. Gesela agrees, but there is a hidden catch-she must speak his name with love in order to free him, too. But can either of them learn to love in time? Contains mature themes. "

Descendants of the Fates are always born in threes: one to weave, one to draw, and one to cut the threads that connect people to the things they love and to life itself. The Ora sisters are no exception. Io, the youngest, uses her Fate-born abilities as a private investigator in the half-sunken city of Alante.

                "From the author of  American as Paneer Pie  comes a magical middle grade adventure steeped in Indian folklore following a girl who learns how to find her voice and face her fears, perfect for fans of Aru Shah and  Amina's Song.   Ten-year-old Geetanjali doesn't mind singing, but she knows she'll never be as good as her mother, Aai, or grandmother, Aaji, famous classical singers from India whose celebrity has followed the family all the way to their small town of Deadwood, Michigan, where Geetanjali lives with her aai, and father, Baba.   After freezing on stage during a concert performance, Geetanjali adds \"fear of singing\" to her list of fears, a list that seems to be multiplying daily. Aai tries to stress the importance of using one's voice and continuing to sing; Geetanjali hopes that when her Aaji, comes to visit this summer, she'll be able to help her.   But when they pick Aaji up at the airport, she's not alone. Lata, an auntie Geetanjali has never met before is with Aaji and their neighbor, Heena Auntie, who is acting strange and mean, and not like the warm auntie she normally is. Lata Auntie has heard all about Geetanjali's family, growing up in India. She knows Aai and Aaji are the only ones who can sing raag Naagshakti. Aai plays it off, but Geetanjali thinks back to the raag in the binder that started with an N that had been torn out. She has never heard of Raag Naagshakti, which sounds like it is about the power of cobras.    Geetanjali is determined not to let her imagination get the best of her and add aunties to her list of fears, but she can't help but wonder about the connection between the missing raag, Heena Auntie's cold behavior, and their interesting summer visitor.

Jo, Abony, Ranjani, and Maia all have something in common: they have each been cursed by the CEO of their workplace after he abused his power to prey on them. He wants them silent and uses his sinister dark magic to keep them quiet about what he did. But Jo, Abony, Ranjani and Maia are not fairy-tale princesses waiting to be rescued. They are fierce, angry women with a bond forged in pain, and they're about to discover that they have power of their own.

                "Renowned author Peter S. Beagle returns to the world of  The Last Unicorn  in this resonant and moving two-novella collection, featuring the award-winning \u201cTwo Hearts\u201d and the brand-new \u201cSooz.\u201d     The Last Unicorn  is one of fantasy\u2019s most revered classics, beloved by generations of readers and with millions of copies in print. Revisiting the world of that novel, Beagle\u2019s long-awaited Hugo and Nebula-Awards-winning \u201cTwo Hearts\u201d introduced the irrepressible Sooz on a quest to save her village from a griffin, and explored the bonds she formed with unforgettable characters like the wise and wonderful Molly Grue and Schmendrick the Magician.  In the never-before-published \u201cSooz,\u201d the events of \u201cTwo Hearts\u201d are years behind its narrator, but a perilous journey lies ahead of her, in a story that is at once a tender meditation on love and loss, and a lesson in finding your true self.   The Way Home  is suffused with Beagle\u2019s wisdom, profound lyricism, and sly wit; and collects two timeless works of fantasy. "

                "\" The Sun Walks Down  is the book I'm always longing to find: brilliant, fresh and compulsively readable. It is marvelous. I loved it start to finish.\" \u2014Ann Patchett, author of  The Dutch House   Fiona McFarlane's blazingly brilliant new novel,  The Sun Walks Down , tells the many-voiced, many-sided story of a boy lost in colonial Australia. In September 1883, a small town in the South Australian outback huddles under strange, vivid sunsets. Six-year-old Denny Wallace has gone missing during a dust storm, and the entire community is caught up in the search for him. As they scour the desert and mountains for the lost child, the residents of Fairly\u2014newlyweds, farmers, mothers, indigenous trackers, cameleers, children, artists, schoolteachers, widows, maids, policemen\u2014confront their relationships, both with one another and with the land\u00adscape they inhabit. The colonial Australia of  The Sun Walks Down  is noisy with opinions, arguments, longings, and terrors. It's haunted by many gods\u2014the sun among them, rising and falling on each day in which Denny could be found, or lost forever. Told in many ways and by many voices, Fiona McFarlane's new novel pulses with love, art, and the unbearable divine. It arrives like a vision: mythic, vivid, and bright with meaning.

Anora Silby can see the dead and turn spirits into gold coins, two things she would prefer to keep secret as she tries to lead a normal life at her new school. After all, she didn't change her identity for nothing. Hiding her weirdness is just one of many challenges. By the end of her first day, she's claimed the soul of a dead girl on campus and lost the coin. Turns out, the coin gives others the ability to steal souls, and when a classmate ends up dead, there's no mistaking the murder weapon. Navigating the loss of her Poppa, the mistrust of her mother, the attention of gorgeous and enigmatic Shy, and Roundtable, an anonymous student gossip app threatening to expose her, are hard enough. Now she must find the person who stole her coin before more lives are lost, but that means making herself a target for the Order, an organization that governs the dead on Earth-and they want Anora and her powers for themselves.

                "For fans of Natalie Haynes, Kiran Millwood-Hargrave and Neil Gaiman comes Frances Hardinge's spectacular new novel  Unraveller.  Called her 'best yet' by the  Guardian , and 'sheer perfection' and 'a masterpiece' by reviewers, Hardinge expertly weaves together mythology and mystery in a meticulously-detailed world besieged by curses.   If you must travel to the country of Raddith, then be prepared. Bring a mosquito net   for the lowlands, and a warm coat for the hills or mountains. If you mean to visit the misty marsh-woods known as the Wilds, you will need stout, waterproof boots. (You will also needs wits, courage and luck, but some things cannot be packed.)   You have of course heard that some people in Raddith are able to curse their enemies. It sounded so picturesque when you were reading about it at home, like a fairytale.   Perhaps you will decide that all the stories of the Wilds and the Raddith cursers were invented to entertain tourists. And at night, when you see a many-legged shape scuttle across the ceiling of your bedchamber, you will tell yourself that it is a spider, and only a spider . . .    . . . It is not.   In a world where anyone can create life-destroying curses, only one person has the power to unravel them.  Kellen does not fully understand his talent, but uses it to help those who have been cursed, including his ally and closest friend, Nettle. But Kellen himself is cursed, and unless he and Nettle can release him, he is in danger of unravelling everything - and everyone - around him. \u2014\u2014- 'Exquisite . . . sheer perfection' \u2013  Liz Hyder 'Brilliant'  \u2013 The Guardian  'A gloriously creepy, intricate masterpiece'  -  Adrian Tchaikovsky 'Dark and delicious'  \u2013  Katherine Rundell 'Spellbinding'  \u2013  Katherine Woodfine 'Instantly engrossing, effortlessly clever, and completely magical'  \u2013  Freya Marske 'Mesmerising'  \u2013  Hilary McKay 'Everyone should read Frances Hardinge.

After moving to New Athens, she hopes to lead an unassuming life disguised as a mortal journalist. Hades, God of the Dead, has built a gambling empire in the mortal world and his favorite bets are rumored to be impossible. After a chance encounter with Hades, Persephone finds herself in a contract with the God of the Dead and the terms are impossible: Persephone must create life in the Underworld or lose her freedom forever. The bet does more than expose Persephone's failure as a goddess, however. As she struggles to sow the seeds of her freedom, love for the God of the Dead grows-and it's forbidden.
