                "Harry Bosch has been given three years before he must retire from the LAPD, and he wants cases more fiercely than ever. In one morning, he gets two. DNA from a 1989 rape and murder matches a 29-year-old convicted rapist. Was he an eight-year-old killer or has something gone terribly wrong in the new Regional Crime Lab? The latter possibility could compromise all of the lab's DNA cases currently in court. Then Bosch and his partner are called to a death scene fraught with internal politics. Councilman Irvin Irving's son jumped or was pushed from a window at the Chateau Marmont. Irving, Bosch's longtime nemesis, has demanded that Harry handle the investigation. Relentlessly pursuing both cases, Bosch makes two chilling discoveries: a killer operating unknown in the city for as many as three decades, and a political conspiracy that goes back into the dark history of the police department.

                "Following an unforgettable cast of characters and a jaded female P.I. enmeshed in a criminal conspiracy in 1980s Mississippi, The Queen City Detective Agency is a riveting, razor-sharp Southern noir that unravels the greed, corruption, and racism at the heart of the American Dream.   Meridian, Mississippi\u2014once known as the Queen City for its status in the state\u2014has lost much of its royal bearing by 1985. Overshadowed by more prosperous cities such as New Orleans and Atlanta, Meridian attracts less-than-legitimate businesses, including those enforced by the near-mythical Dixie Mafia. The city's powerbrokers, wealthy white Southerners clinging to their privilege, resent any attempt at change to the old order.  Real-estate developer Randall Hubbard took advantage of Meridian's economic decline by opening strip malls that catered to low-income families in Black neighborhoods\u2014until he wound up at the business end of a .38 Special. Then a Dixie Mafia affiliate named Lewis \"Turnip\" Coogan, who claims Hubbard's wife hired him for the hit, dies under suspicious circumstances while in custody for the murder.  Ex-cop turned private investigator Clementine Baldwin is hired by Coogan's bereaved mother to find her son's killer. A woman struggling with her own history growing up in Mississippi, Clem braves the Queen City's corridors of crime as she digs into the case, opening wounds long forgotten. She soon finds herself in the crosshairs of powerful and dangerous people who manipulate the law for their own ends\u2014and will kill anyone who threatens to reveal their secrets. "

In the winter of 1906, Lady Emily and husband Colin are invited to the opulent home of Baroness Ursula von Duchtel in the Bavarian alps. Outside is a mountainous winter wonderland with a view of Mad King Ludwig's fairy tale castle. Inside, the villa hosts a magnificent but eclectic art collection\u2014as well as an equally eclectic collection of fellow guests, among them a musician, an art dealer, a coquette from the demi-monde, and Kaspar, the Baroness' boorish son-in-law, whom, it begins to appear, someone wants dead.  Almost forty years earlier, Niels, a young German lord, sings to himself in the forest surrounding those same alps, capturing the attention of a not-yet-mad King Ludwig.

In \"Christmas Even,\" the case of a burglar killed in mid-heist leads Bosch to retrace a link to his past. In \"Father's Day,\" Bosch investigates a young boy's seemingly accidental death and confronts his own fears as a father. In \"Angle of Investigation,\" Bosch delves into one of the first homicides he ever worked back as a uniformed rookie patrolman, a case that was left unsolved for decades. Together, these gripping stories span Bosch's controversial career at the LAPD, and show the evolution of the haunted, legendary investigator he would become. Utterly unputdownable, they are proof that \"Connelly never stops doling out the suspense....Once it grabs you in those first few pages, it won't let go of you\" ( Boston Globe ). "

Harry originally investigated the murder, but it was then handed off to the Riot Crimes Task Force and never solved. Now Bosch's ballistics match indicates that her death was not random violence, but something more personal, and connected to a deeper intrigue. Like an investigator combing through the wreckage after a plane crash, Bosch searches for the \"black box,\" the one piece of evidence that will pull the case together. Riveting and relentlessly paced, THE BLACK BOX leads Harry Bosch, \"one of the greats of crime fiction\" ( New York Daily News ), into one of his most fraught and perilous cases. "

J P Delaney  When a man is found on a Norfolk beach, drifting in and out of consciousness, with no identification and unable to speak, interest in him is sparked immediately. From the hospital staff who find themselves inexplicably drawn to him; to international medical experts who are baffled by him; to the nationalpress who call him Mr Nobody; everyone wants answers. Who is this man? And what happened to him?    Neuropsychiatrist Dr Emma Lewis is asked to assess the patient. This is her field of expertise, this is the chance she's been waiting for and this case could make her name known across the world. But therein lies the danger. Emma left this same small town in Norfolk fourteen years ago and has taken great pains to cover all traces of her past since then.    But now something \u2013 or someone \u2013 is calling her back. And the more time she spends with her patient, the more alarmed she becomes.    Has she walked into danger?

When an anonymous letter is delivered to the Clarendon English Dictionary, it is rapidly clear that this is not the usual lexicographical enquiry. Instead, the letter hints at secrets and lies linked to a particular year. For Martha Thornhill, the new senior editor, the date can mean only one thing: the summer her brilliant older sister Charlie went missing. After a decade abroad, Martha has returned home to the city whose ancient institutions have long defined her family. Have the ghosts she left behind her been waiting for her return? When more letters arrive, and Martha and her team pull apart the complex clues within them, the mystery becomes ever more insistent and troubling. It seems Charlie had been keeping a powerful secret, and someone is trying to lead the lexicographers towards the truth. But other forces are no less desperate to keep it well and truly buried. "

Just as Finchmere flings open its gates to welcome swarms of visitors to their idyllic summer fete - celebrating rewilding, artisan produce and local crafts - Nell realises the disguised peril has already wormed its way into the heart of Finchmere itself, and the path of destruction soon leads to murder.  DI James Clar  k 's and Nell's powers of observation are put to the test to detect the camouflaged predator.  With everyone as a suspect, who can Nell really trust when those she loves are in danger?    A Swarm of Butterflies    is the sixth book in the Dr Nell Ward series.

It\u2019s been five weeks since Io left Alante to follow the golden thread, and she\u2019s no closer to finding the god on the other end. She spends her days in constant, grueling travel and her nights worrying over the fate-thread she shares with Edei\u2014which seems to be fraying. Making matters worse, she and Bianca soon realize that their only lead has shaken them off, snapped the golden thread, and disappeared. But not before Io gathers some crucial clues. Her investigation leads her to a new mystery, a rash of sibling disappearances across the Wastelands that seems to be connected to the murders in Alante. And all signs point to Nanzy, the golden city, as the center of the whole conspiracy. As Io and Bianca make their way to Nanzy, they face powerful enemies, find allies new and old, and uncover a horrifying plot that traces back centuries. The more Io learns, the more she begins to suspect that the future of the world may truly rest on her shoulders.

Gaia is dying. That, at least, is what Dr. Lionel Scott believes. A renowned expert in tropical and infectious diseases, Scott has witnessed the devastating impact of illness and turmoil at critical scale. Society as it exists is untenable, and the direct link to Earth's death spiral; population levels are out of control and people have allowed disarray and disorder to run rampant. While most are concerned about deadly disease, Scott knows that it is truly humanity itself that will destroy Gaia. It's only by removing the threat that the planet can continue to prosper, and luckily, Scott is just the right man for the job... When Scott then disappears without a trace, Letty Davenport is tasked with tracking down any and all leads. Scott's connections to sensitive research into virus and pathogen spread has multiple national and international organizations on high alert, and his shockingly high clearance levels at various institutions, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, make him the last person they'd like to go missing. As the web around Scott becomes more tangled, Letty calls in her father, Lucas, help her lead a group of specialists to find Scott as soon as possible. But as Letty and Lucas begin to uncover startling and disturbing connections between Scott and Gaia conspiracists, their worst fears are confirmed, and it quickly becomes a race to find him before the virus he created becomes the perfect weapon.

                "\"McFarlane's skill in evoking individual inner lives and Jones's deftness in capturing their spirit make every character distinct.\" \u2014 The Washington Post  on The Sun Walks Down, one of  The Washington Post 's 10 Best Audiobooks of 2023 A gripping, enigmatic collection of linked short stories about the reverberations of a serial killer's crimes in the lives of everyday people.    In 1998, an apparently ordinary Australian man is arrested and charged for a series of brutal murders. The news shocks the nation, bringing both horror and resolution to the victims' families, but its impact travels even further: into the past, as the murders rewrite personal histories, and into the future, as true crime podcasts and biopics tell the story of the crimes.   Highway Thirteen , Fiona McFarlane's newest collection, takes murder as its starting point, but it unfolds to encompass much more: through the investigation of the aftermath of this violence across time and place, from the killer's childhood town to Texas, Rome, and tropical northern Australia, McFarlane presents an oblique, entrancing exploration of the way stories are told and spread, and at what cost.  What damages, big and small, do these crimes incur? How do communities make sense of such atrocities? How does the mourning of families sit alongside the public fascination with terrible crimes? And can we tell true crime stories without centering the killers? From the acclaimed author of  The Sun Walks Down  and  The High Places  comes a captivating account of loss and its extended echoes in individual lives.  A Macmillan Audio production from Farrar, Straus and Giroux. "

                "A penguin is all that stands between one man and murder by the mafia   Sit back and enjoy this darkly comic full-cast adaptation of Andrey Kurkov's bestselling novel set in mid-90s Ukraine, plus a bonus interview with the author. Viktor Alekseyevich Zolotaryov is an aspiring writer in Ukraine, with only his pet king penguin, Misha, for company. After Viktor gets a job writing obituaries for a local newspaper, he soon finds that his articles are being used as a hit list by some unknown organisation. Feeling as lost and unhappy as his penguin, Viktor's life takes a complicated turn when he takes in Sonya, the young daughter of an old friend, and hires Nina to be her nanny. Can Viktor protect everyone and keep himself (and his penguin) alive, or is he destined to become the subject of the paper's latest obituary? A blend of Gogol's absurdist humour and Kafka's alienation, this tragi-comedy is set in the wild west atmosphere of a newly independent Ukraine following the collapse of the Soviet Union. At its heart, this is a story about surviving and enduring in perilous times. Starring Tom Basden ( After Life)  as aspiring writer Viktor, and BAFTA winner Jason Watkins ( The Crown ) as the mysterious Lyosha. This release also includes an episode of BBC Radio's  World Book Club,  in which Kurkov discusses his darkly funny tale with Harriett Gilbert. Recorded live in his native Ukraine, at the historic Mikhail Bulgakov Museum in Kiev, he responds to listeners' questions from around the world. Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian author who writes in Russian. He has written 19 novels and is a respected commentator on Ukraine, regularly appearing on Radio 4 with his 'Letters from Ukraine' series.  Death and the Penguin  is Kurkov's most famous work, translated into more than 30 languages. \u00a92024 BBC Studios Distribution Ltd (P)2024 BBC Studios Distribution Ltd  Death and the Penguin   Written by Andrey Kurkov Translated by George Bird Adapted by Hattie Naylor Directed by Gemma Jenkins Viktor - Tom Basden Lyosha - Jason Watkins Igor - David Hounslow Sonya - Blythe Arbery Nina - Chlo\u00eb Sommer Misha-non-Penguin - Roger Ringrose Sergey - Tom Kiteley Natasha - Fiona Skinner Dr Pidpaly - Joanna Monro First Broadcast BBC Radio 4, 14 January 2023  World Book Club: Andrey Kurkov - Death and the Penguin   Presented by Harriett Gilbert First Broadcast BBC World Service, 5 September 2015.

The only job he can find is as a physician in the backwaters of Wales where he can't speak the language, belief in myth and magic is rife, and the villagers treat him with bewildering suspicion. When Henry discovers his predecessor died under mysterious circumstances, he is determined to find answers. Linette Tresilian, the unconventional mistress of Plas Helyg, lives a lonely life. Her father is long dead, her mother haunted by demons which keep her locked away in her room, and her cousin treats her with cool disdain - she has had no choice but to become fiercely self-reliant. Linette has always suspected something is not quite right in the village, but it is only through Henry's investigations that the truth about those closest to her will come to light...a truth that will bind hers and Henry's destinies together in ways neither thought possible.

                "A fast-paced, completely delightful new mystery about what happens when parents get a little too involved in their kids' schools, from NAACP Image Award nominee Elise Bryant.  Mavis Miller is  not  a PTA mom. She has enough on her plate with her feisty seven-year-old daughter, Pearl, an exhausting job at a nonprofit, and the complexities of a multigenerational household. So no one is more surprised than Mavis when she caves to Trisha Holbrook, the long-reigning, slightly terrifying PTA president, and finds herself in charge of the school\u2019s brand-new DEI committee. As one of the few Black parents at this California elementary school, Mavis  tries  to convince herself this is an opportunity for real change. But things go off the rails at the very first meeting, when the new principal's plans leave Trisha absolutely  furious . Later that night, when Mavis spies Trisha in yellow rubber gloves and booties, lugging cleaning supplies and giant black trash bags to her waiting minivan, it\u2019s only natural that her mind jumps to somewhere it surely wouldn\u2019t in the light of day. Except Principal Smith fails to show up for work the next morning, and has been MIA since the meeting. Determined to get to the bottom of things, Mavis, along with the school psychologist with the great forearms (look, it\u2019s worth noting), launches an investigation that will challenge her views on parenting, friendship, and elementary school politics. Brilliantly written,  It's Elementary  is a\u00a0quick-witted, escapist romp that perfectly captures just how far parents will go to give their kids the very best, all wrapped in a mystery that will leave you guessing to the very end.

What I love about these books is the seamless weaving of factual history with a great story' \u2013 Abir Mukherjee   Florence. Spring, 1537.  When Cesare Aldo investigates a report of intruders at a convent in the Renaissance city's northern quarter, he enters a community divided by bitter rivalries and harbouring dark secrets. His case becomes far more complicated when a man's body is found deep inside the convent, stabbed more than two dozen times. Unthinkable as it seems, all the evidence suggests one of the nuns must be the killer. Meanwhile, Constable Carlo Strocchi finds human remains pulled from the Arno that belong to an officer of the law missing since winter. The dead man had many enemies, but who would dare kill an official of the city's most feared criminal court? As Aldo and Strocchi close in on the truth, identifying the killers will prove more treacherous than either of them could ever have imagined . . .   The Darkest Sin  is an atmospheric locked-room thriller by D. V. Bishop, set in Renaissance Florence and is the sequel to  City of Vengeance . "

The killer can't have left the scene without being spotted by the dozens of witnesses - so he must still be there, among them.

The evidence against criminal defense attorney Erin McCabe's new client is overwhelming. The gun used is Mazer's off-duty weapon. Fingerprints and carpet fibers link Mazer to the crime. And Mazer was patrolling Marshall's neighborhood shortly before the victim took three bullets to the chest. Mazer's argument?

With everyone from the governor to the county prosecutor on the wrong side of justice, Erin and her partner, Duane Swisher, are prepared to do anything to make sure Mazer doesn't become another victim.As Erin deals with an intensely personal issue at home, and faces an uphill battle to prove her client's innocence, both she and Duane find themselves mired in a conspiracy of corruption deeper than they imagined\u2014and far more dangerous than they feared.

A Gulf War vet and ex-con always one stumble away from catastrophe, he manages to scrape together enough money from various jobs to eke out a precarious existence on the darker fringes of Los Angeles.

She lives alone in her Airstream trailer and works as a fishing and hunting guide in scenic Idaho. Her closest friends are the community's makeshift reverend and a handsome Forest Service ranger who took her in at her lowest. But when Tyler shows up with the news that Janessa is missing, Emlyn is propelled back into the world she worked so hard to forget.

She hasn't posted lately, though, and when Emlyn realizes the most recent photo doesn't match up with its caption, she reluctantly joins Tyler to find her old friend. As the two trace Janessa's path through miles of wild country, Emlyn can't deny the chemistry still crackling between them. But the deeper they press into the wilderness, the more she begins to suspect that a darker truth lies in the woods\u2014and that Janessa isn't the only one in danger.

Someone is trying to kill Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Esteemed aunt of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, generous patroness of Mr. William Collins, a woman of rank who rules over the estate of Rosings Park with an\u00a0unimpeachable sense of propriety\u2014who would  dare ? Lady Catherine summons her grand-nephew, Mr. Jonathan Darcy, and his investigative companion, Miss Juliet Tilney, to find out. After a year apart, Jonathan and Juliet are thrilled to be reunited, even if the circumstances\u2014finding whoever has thus far sabotaged Lady Catherine's carriage, shot at her, and nearly pushed her down the stairs\u2014are less than ideal. Also less than ideal: their respective fathers, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy and Mr. Henry Tilney, have accompanied the young detectives to Rosings, and the two men do not interact with the same felicity enjoyed by their children. With attempts against Lady Catherine escalating, and no one among the list of prime suspects seemingly capable of committing all of the attacks, the pressure on Jonathan and Juliet mounts\u2014even as more gentle feelings between the two of them begin to bloom. The race is now on to provoke  two  confessions: one from the attempted murderer before it is too late\u2014and one, perhaps, of love. "

Deena Wood's life has fallen apart in the aftermath of losing her beloved mother, her marriage, and her prestigious job at an Atlanta law firm. She needs what the Geechee people of coastal Georgia call a \"dayclean,\" a fresh start.  She returns to her childhood home in Brunswick, Georgia, to heal. But her return is anything but the respite she thought it might be. To make peace with all her loss, she often drives through the city. One day, she unwittingly finds herself on the oceanfront property of a loner widower who is fighting to keep land that has been in his family since the end of the Civil War. He threatens her and warns her to never return. But shortly after, he disappears, and his very expensive property is quickly put up for sale. Curious about what has happened to the man, Deena digs into his disappearance and finds a family legacy at risk. What starts out as a bit of curious snooping, turns into a deadly game of illegal land grabs and property redevelopment in poor and rural communities with dark and powerful forces at work.  Without realizing it, Deena finds herself caught up in a nightmarish scheme that threatens her community and her family. She'll need help and finds it in a close but unlikely source because she knows she must do whatever it takes to stop the sinister forces at play before she becomes their next target. "

                "Alice has made the most of her maternity leave, becoming simultaneously a proud mum (well, a mum, at least) and accidental amateur sleuth. With her son, Jack, fast approaching his first birthday, she is keen to continue to keep him alive and maybe finally catch up on some sleep ... if she's lucky. When an opportunity presents itself in the unexpected form of a sit-in protest, Alice and her friends willingly chain themselves to trees and settle in for some overdue rest - not the most comfortable arrangement ever, but at this point they'll take what they can get.  But the next morning one of their fellow protestors is found strangled and any hope of a blissful interlude is suddenly swept away on a tide of adult hysteria involving rogue artists, an enigmatic local entrepreneur and nude protesting (optional) - a surprising, but not necessarily unwelcome, break from changing nappies and cleaning Weetabix off the dog. For Alice, whose success rate in solving countryside murder is at an all-time high (one out of one), she cannot resist the chance to demonstrate her detectoring skills once more and assembles her gang of young mums to investigate this latest countryside mystery.

The long weekend of festivities includes a beauty pageant, beekeeping demonstrations, a local restaurant bake-off, and a 3K Bear Run where all the participants are dressed as bears. The bake-off brings in a television crew from California to film, so it's the most drama-filled part of the weekend, especially when the famous celebrity host winds up dead. Because the celebrity was holding her bracelet and had been witnessed having an altercation with Bailey's best friend Evie shortly before his death, everyone suspects Evie of the murder\u2014and Bailey is quickly on the hunt for clues to clear Evie's name, alongside Granny Bee and her bunch of geriatric misfit friends. Bailey's potential new honey, Sheriff Sawyer Dunn, is none too pleased to have Bailey buzzing around the investigation, but Bailey's determined to uncover the truth, rescue her grannie's beloved Bee Festival, and save her bestie. They say you get more flies with honey, but in this case, more honey may mean you end up dead. And a little competition never hurt anyone\u2014unless it ends up killing you. "

Nestled in the rugged Grampian Mountains, Glamis is the most historic castle in all of Scotland, a place teeming with dark secrets and haunting shadows. While Kate winds her way through the elaborate manor, gaining inspiration for her next Gothic novel, Lord Charles discovers the reason behind their journey. It seems Prince Eddy, heir to the throne until his purported death in 1892, has actually been alive all these years. Deemed unfit to rule, he has been living secretly at Glamis under an assumed name. But now the prince has gone missing\u2014on the very morning the body of one of his servants was found, her throat slashed in a manner eerily reminiscent of the Ripper's. Now, Charles and his clever Kate must find Eddy and clear his name\u2014while keeping his true identity a secret... "

But Italian prodigy Guglielmo Marconi beats them to the punch by sending the first wireless signal across the Atlantic from his station on the Lizard. Naturally, his feat has bruised some egos, but no one expects sabotage\u2014much less murder. After two apparently accidental deaths at the Marconi transmission station, Charles, Lord Sheridan, an amateur forensic detective and avid wireless enthusiast, is asked to head an investigation. And when he finds that valuable equipment and the notebook describing it have disappeared, the deaths look more like murders than accidents. Meanwhile, Kate Sheridan visits Lady Loveday, who lives on nearby Frenchman's Creek and whose little girl has recently drowned. Soon it becomes clear that the drowning and the dirty tricks at the station are connected to an enigmatic stranger\u2014and to foreign espionage, malicious intrigue, and inexplicable messages sent out of the blue...

Nineteen-year-old college student Eliza Hennessey is trans\u2014and she has a rocky relationship with her father, their new client. Brian's convinced his daughter's vanished, rather than run away, but Fran and Ken aren't so sure she wants to be found. The PI duo investigate, and soon Fran is butting heads with her irritating sort-of-ex-boyfriend Mank at the NYPD, who has what seems to be a similar case on his desk. But not even Fran could guess how tangled their investigations are going to get\u2014or how deep they'll need to dive into murder and mayhem to solve the case! The new instalment of the Fran and Ken Stein mystery series, following Ukulele of Death, has it all: unique characters, witty humor, and a twisty mystery plot to die for!. "

                "A razor-sharp debut thriller about what happens when one of the first child stars of the social media age grows up ... and goes missing.  Hazel Davis is drifting: newly unemployed, living in a city she hates, and significantly less successful than her infamous younger sister, Evie. Evie grew up online, having gone viral at age five in a daddy-daughter dance video. She had an Instagram following in elementary school, and brand sponsorships before she had a driver's permit. Now she's a megapopular lifestyle influencer, with a million-dollar career at an age when few teens know what they're going to major in.  But to Hazel, @evelyn is just Evie, her beloved little sister\u2014and a kid who has been exploited for her entire childhood. Ten years older and spotlight-averse, Hazel has managed to dodge the family business, but she's deeply protective of Evie and skeptical of the way everyone seems to want a piece of her: Evie's followers, her YouTuber boyfriend, her frenemies across the influencer industry.  So when Evie disappears\u2014in the middle of a live stream, during a brand-sponsored trip to Los Angeles\u2014Hazel knows something is terribly wrong. Determined to find her sister, Hazel throws herself into the darkest parts of internet culture to untangle the threads of truth behind Evie's disappearance. After all, Hazel knows Evie better than anyone else ... doesn't she?  Internet fame, the allure of parasocial relationships, and some of our deepest cultural obsessions collide in this electric thriller by a debut writer to watch. "

January 1970 finds Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins, LA's premier Black detective, at 50 years of age despite all expectations. He has a loving family, a beautiful home, and a thriving investigation agency. All is right with the world... and then Amethystine Stoller, his own personal Helen of Troy, arrives. Her ex-husband is missing. A simple enough case. But even as Easy takes his first step in the investigation he trips. He falls into the memory of things past. Little things, like loss, love, a world war, and a hunger that has eaten at him since he was a Black boy on his own on the streets of Fifth Ward, Houston, Texas.  The missing ex, a young white man named Curt Fields, is found dead. Easy's only real friend in the LAPD, Melvin Suggs, has gone into hiding rather than allow his femme fatale wife to go to the gas chamber. And that's only the beginning.  Easy finds himself pressed into a reckoning. All of his success cannot succor his heart. The 1970's have ushered in new expectations of men and women, Black and White, and Easy has to make a choice that will almost certainly hasten a permanent descent, one that might sunder his soul. "

Kate hopes to find inspiration for her new Gothic novel while Charles plans to implement a fingerprinting program at the prison\u2014and arrange a meeting with one of its most infamous inmates, Samuel Spencer.

The Silent Patient  meets  Gone Girl  in this sharp psychological thriller about a psychiatrist with a shocking past and her dangerous new patient.   Brooklyn psychiatrist Dr. Caroline Strange is certain she knows what's best for her patients, her family, and pretty much everyone else, but that all changes when a troubled young man arrives for his appointment and makes a pair of alarming confessions:  I am going to kill someone , and  I know who you really are . Dr. Caroline is accustomed to hearing her patients' deepest, darkest secrets, but it seems Nelson Schack may be one step ahead when detectives show up later that day, inquiring about a missing woman. It looks like Nelson has made good on his threat\u2014yet somehow it's Dr. Caroline who becomes the prime suspect. Convinced the police are incompetent, Dr. Caroline takes matters into her own hands, chasing down the elusive Nelson and running headlong into a past she has spent her entire life trying to forget. As she closes in on her target, all the polished pieces of her manicured life splinter when people begin to question who she really is. Harrowing, unpredictable, and compulsively readable, the award-winning author Louisa Luna's  Tell Me Who You Are  is an utterly gripping psychological thriller that begs the question: Can a person ever really outrun their past?
