Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven audiobook offers clear, concrete language to introduce the concept of BODY LIBERATION. This audiobook serves to celebrate the uniqueness of your body and all bodies, and addresses the unfair rules and ideas that currently exist about bodies. It ends with motivational action points for making the world more fair for all! While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. "

He would: - make rude noises from BOTH ENDS... - pick his nose with his little toe... - eat the skins of bananas, hurling out the tasty part inside. NASA's scientists thought he'd be the PERFECT chimp to send into space. Little did Chump know that he had been selected for a deadly-dangerous mission. If a chimp could orbit Earth, then chances were a human could too. With Chump the chimp at the controls of a spacecraft, what could possibly go wrong? As it turned out, EVERYTHING. Blast off with Chump, and encounter dog space pirates, evil insects, and the silliest chimpanzee who ever lived in this wildly funny space opera, fully illustrated in fantastic colour. David Walliams was most recently Children's number one bestseller with The Blunders TCM Chart, 14 October 2023). "

Aspiring artist Kacie spends most of her time on Mercer Street with her best friend, Nisha, people-watching and doodling whatever is happening in their neighborhood. But when she comes back from a summer away, the local corner store is boarded up, the adults in town are all on edge, and Nisha is nowhere to be found! Everything is changing, and Kacie's not sure what to do about it. Especially without Nisha to help her.    But Kacie has a knack for noticing things, and with her sketchbooks and observational skills, she just might have what it takes to figure out what's really happening on Mercer Street. "

Portico Reeves is the greatest superhero a lot of people have never heard of. He likes it that way\u2014then no one can get in the way of him from keeping other other people safe. Super safe. He's Stuntboy. He's got the moves. And the saves. Except. There's been one major fail.   He couldn't save his parents from becoming Xs. Which is a word that sounds like coughing up a hairball. But don't talk to him about the divorce, because of the hairball thing, and also, it gives Portico the frets.   What's also giving him frets is his parents living on two separate floors in their apartment building. He's never fully with one parent or the other. He's in-between, all the time. The in-between time. And the elevator is busted, so to get between floors means getting  past  the bullies who hang in the stairwells.   So when Portico and new friend, Herbert, and best best friend, Zola, discover  an empty apartment , unlocked, they are  psyched . It's a perfect hideout, and hangout, and it's not half anyone's...it's  all  theirs. So they decide to make it their own...let's say with stunts of the drawing kind. Problem is, that gives some Grown Up People the frets, which leads to double frets for Portico. And he's not sure his arsenal of stunts can combat  that . "

Portico Reeves's superpower is making sure all the other superheroes\u2014like his parents and two best friends\u2014stay super. And safe. Super safe. And he does this all in secret. No one in his civilian life knows he's actually...Stuntboy!   But his regular Portico identity is pretty cool, too. He lives in the biggest house on the block, maybe in the whole city, which basically makes it a castle. His mom calls where they live an apartment building. But a building with fifty doors just in the hallways is definitely a castle. And behind those fifty doors live a bunch of different people who Stuntboy saves all the time. In fact, he's the only reason the cat, New Name Every Day, has nine lives.   All this is swell except for Portico's other secret, his not-so-super secret. His parents are fighting  all  the time. They're trying to hide it by repeatedly telling Portico to go check on a neighbor \"in the meantime.\" But Portico knows \"meantime\" means his parents are heading into the Mean Time which  means  they're about to get into it, and well, Portico's superhero responsibility is to save them, too\u2014as soon as he figures out how.   Only, all these secrets give Portico the worry wiggles, the frets, which his mom calls anxiety. Plus, like all superheroes, Portico has an arch-nemesis who is determined to prove that there is nothing  super  about Portico at all. "

                "Inspired by her blockbuster phenomenon  Wonder , R. J. Palacio presents an unforgettable story of the power of kindness and unrelenting courage in a time of war.   In R. J. Palacio's bestselling collection of stories  Auggie & Me , which expands on characters in  Wonder , audiences were introduced to Julian's grandmother, Grandm\u00e8re. Here, Palacio presents Grandm\u00e8re's heartrending story: how she, a young Jewish girl, was hidden by a family in a Nazi-occupied French village during World War II; how the boy she and her classmates once shunned became her savior and best friend.  Sara's harrowing experience movingly demonstrates the power of kindness to change hearts, build bridges, and even save lives. As Grandm\u00e8re tells Julian, \"It always takes courage to be kind, but in those days, such kindness could cost you everything.\" With poignant symbolism that brings Sara's story out of the past and cements it firmly in this moment in history,  White Bird  is sure to captivate anyone who was moved by the book  Wonder  or the blockbuster movie adaptation and its message. This full-cast audio adaptation of  White Bird  transforms the graphic novel into a truly original audio performance.

Just know this: there's a Merry, a Larry, a missing tooth, and a teachers' strike that is crippling Timmy Failure's academic future. Worst of all, Timmy is banned from detective work. It's a conspiracy of buffoons. He recorded everything in his private notebook, but then the manuscript was stolen. If this book gets out, he will be grounded for life. Or maybe longer. And will Timmy's mom really marry Doorman Dave. "
