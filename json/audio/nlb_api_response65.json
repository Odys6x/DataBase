                "In the first installment of a Regency romp of a series, a governess who believes in cultivating joy in her charges clashes with the children\u2019s uncle who hired her, only to find herself falling in love.   When Harry Kincaid\u2019s flighty older sister decides to join her husband on an Egyptian expedition, Harry, a former naval captain, is left in the lurch, minding her three unruly children and giant, mad dog. But Harry has a busy career at the Admiralty that requires all his attention, and he has no clue how to manage the little rascals or when his sister is coming back. In desperation, he goes to Miss Prentice\u2019s School for Young Ladies prepared to pay whatever it takes to hire an emergency governess quick sharp to ensure everything in his formerly ordered house is run shipshape again.  Thanks to her miserable, strict upbringing, fledgling governess Georgie Rowe does not subscribe to the ethos that children should be seen and not heard. She believes childhood should be everything hers wasn\u2019t\u2014filled with laughter, adventure, and discovery. Thankfully, the three Pendleton children she has been tasked with looking after are already delightfully bohemian and instantly embrace her unconventional educational approach. Their staid, stickler-for-the-rules uncle, however, is another matter entirely.  Georgie and Harry continue to butt heads over their differences, but with time it seems that in this case, their attraction is undeniable\u2014and all is indeed fair in love and war. "

The annual trip that Archie takes with his BFFs Simon and Effie holds a sacred spot in their calendars. This year Archie is especially eager to get away until an urgent letter arrives from an old family friend, begging him to help prevent a ruinous scandal. Suddenly the trip has become earls-plus-girls, as Archie's childhood pals, Clementine and Olive Morgan, are rescued en route to Gretna Green. This . . . complicates matters. The fully grown Clementine, while as frank and refreshing as he remembers, is also different to the wild, windswept girl he knew. This Clem is complex and surprising-and adamantly opposed to marriage. Which, for reasons Archie dare not examine too closely, he finds increasingly vexing. Then Clem makes him an indecent and quite delightful proposal, asking him to show her the pleasures of the marriage bed before she settles into spinsterhood. And what kind of gentleman would he be to refuse a lady?. "

A starry-eyed romantic, a cynical writer, and (the ashes of) an elderly woman take the road trip of a\u00a0lifetime that just might upend everything they believe about true love.  Millicent Watts-Cohen is on a mission. When she promised her elderly best friend that she\u2019d reunite her with the woman she fell in love with nearly eighty years ago, she never imagined that would mean traveling from D.C. to Key West with three tablespoons of Mrs. Nash\u2019s remains in her backpack. But Millie\u2019s determined to give her friend a symbolic happily-ever-after, before it\u2019s (really) too late\u2014and hopefully reassure herself of love\u2019s lasting power in the process. She just didn\u2019t expect to have a  living  travel companion. After a computer glitch grounds flights, Millie is forced to catch a ride with Hollis Hollenbeck, an also-stranded acquaintance from her ex\u2019s MFA program. Hollis certainly does  not  believe in happily-ever-afters\u2014symbolic or otherwise\u2014and makes it quite clear that he can\u2019t fathom Millie\u2019s plan ending well for anyone. But as they contend with peculiar bed-and-breakfasts, unusual small-town festivals, and deer with a death wish, Millie begins to suspect that her reluctant travel partner might enjoy her company more than he lets on. Because for someone who supposedly doesn\u2019t share her views on romance, Hollis sure is becoming invested in the success of their journey. And the closer they get to their destination, the more Millie has to admit that maybe this trip isn\u2019t just about Mrs. Nash\u2019s love story after all\u2014maybe it\u2019s also about her own. "

But writing forthright reviews of the Season's most popular plays for Mrs. Goode's Magazine for Misses, popularly known as Goode's Guide to Misconduct, is surely the next best thing. Even better, she's got a ticket to Ransom Blackadder's latest irritating satire about English society. Best of all, she's sharing a theater box with the gruff but handsome Lord Dunstane, which is enough to make Julia call for an encore ...

But when Graham realizes she is the critic who panned his last play\u2014and she discovers he is, in fact, the man behind Blackadder's wicked pen will it bring down the curtain on their romance, not to mention the magazine that published the humiliating review?

He tells her about the time in 1962 he met a girl on the number 88 bus with beautiful red hair just like her own. They made plans for a date, but Frank lost the ticket with her number written on it. For the past sixty years, he's ridden the same bus trying to find her.  Libby is inspired by the story and, with the help of an unlikely companion, she makes it her mission to continue Frank's search.

                "A struggling event planner and a sinfully hot astronaut must decide if their fake relationship is worth a shot at happily-ever-after, in this starry debut.  Risk-averse event planner Amerie Price is jobless, newly single, and about to lose her apartment. With no choice but to gamble on her shaky start-up, the last thing she needed was to run into her smug ex and his new, less complicated girlfriend at Amerie's favorite coffee shop. Panicked, she pretends to be dating the annoyingly sexy man she met by spilling Americano all over his abs. He plays along\u2014for a price. Half the single men in Houston claim to be astronauts, but Vincent Rogers turns out to be the real deal. What started as a one-off lie morphs into a plan: for the three months leading up to his mission, Amerie will play Vincent's doting partner in front of his loving but overly invested family. In exchange, she gets a rent-free room in his house and can put every penny toward her struggling business. What Amerie doesn't plan for is Vincent's gravitational pull. While her mind tells her a future with this astronaut is too unpredictable, her heart says he's exactly what she needs. As their time together counts down, Amerie must decide if she'll settle for the safe life\u2014or shoot for the stars. "

In the two years since his shipwreck, his friends and family mourned him, his brother spent his savings, and his fianc\u00e9e married someone else. So when he turns up in the middle of the London social season, he quickly becomes the talk of the town. All Eli wants is to set his life back in order and reconnect with Jane Bishop, a friend who has always meant so much more to him, before returning to sea. Jane refuses to waste any more of her life pining over Eli, who chose her cousin instead of her. She needs to focus on gaining her financial independence by establishing a ladies' gambling club. Never mind that Eli keeps trying to atone for his past mistake by bringing in new members. He's obviously keeping secrets about his disappearance, which means that she can't trust him with her heart even if she did kiss him in a moment of weakness. Or three. As Eli works to regain her trust, Jane's defensive walls begin to crumble. But when Eli faces a court of inquiry on suspicion of desertion, Jane must decide if she can let go of the past to build a future with Eli or if she's willing to risk losing him for good. "

Lady Charlotte Lovett should have never run away upon discovering her betrothal. But when one has been promised to a man who, rumor has it, killed his previous two wives, one does what one must. The only thing that can get her out of this engagement is proving that Viscount Hawley is as sinister as she thinks he is. And the person who would know best is his very own brother.  In many ways, Dr. Matthew Talbot is the exact opposite of his sibling\u2014scholarly, shy, and shunned by society. But like his brother, he has secrets, and he doesn't need Charlotte exposing them in her quest to take down the viscount. It only seems prudent to help her while keeping her from poking her nose in all the wrong places. But as they put their hearts at risk to grow closer to each other, they are also getting closer to a dangerous confrontation with Hawley. "

West, the Marquess of Weston, and Sophie, Lady Fitzwilliam Bridewell, have lately been spending a considerable amount of time together. But West and Sophie are not new acquaintances. In fact, years ago, they had once been nearly engaged until West's almost fatal curricle accident and his meddling father threw them off course.   Now recently widowed, Sophie has put aside all thoughts of romance. But when her widowed sister, Alexandra, mentions a fondness for an earl, Sophie realizes that she may be holding her sister back. Alexandra won't move forward with an engagement until Sophie, too, settles down again, and so Sophie approaches West with a plan. They will announce their engagement and break things off once Alexandra is happily married. It'll be simple. After all, it's not like she is going to fall for West a second time, not when Sophie has sworn not to risk her heart again. "

Thoughtful, hilarious, and smolderingly steamy.\u201d\u2014Kristina Forest, author of  The Partner Plot  Two sisters roll up their sleeves to run a dilapidated inn but must learn to work with the locals in this deliciously spicy novel inspired by  Sense and Sensibility.    There\u2019s never a good time to learn you are your father\u2019s secret child\u2014especially not at the reading of his will. With their father\u2019s affairs laid bare and Nora\u2019s sensible reputation in tatters due to a viral video scandal, she and her free-spirited sister have nothing left but a rustic inn in the middle of nowhere and each other. What\u2019s more, they need to revamp the inn before Labor Day or they lose it all. Nora hasn\u2019t even knocked the traveling dust off last season\u2019s designer boots when she\u2019s confronted with three problems:\u00a0 1. She  really  should have watched more HGTV. 2. She hasn\u2019t seen another Black person for miles. 3. A tall, dark stranger has already staked a claim on their property. Native Abenaki eco-tour guide Ennis \u201cBear\u201d Freeman has seen hapless tourists come and go. When he spots two pampered city girls at his unofficial headquarters, he expects them to catch a flight out of the inhospitable coastal Maine backwoods within a week\u2019s time. But Nora, turns out, is made of sterner stuff. And as she rolls up her sleeves to breathe new life into the inn, she unwittingly reignites a flood of emotions inside of Bear that he had very intentionally suppressed. Their connection is electric, their desire palpable. But Bear\u2019s silence about his mysterious past might turn out to be the one thing that sends Nora packing. "

He's certainly capable of taking care of his aunt's perfectly behaved poodle, Lancelot, while she's on holiday. Elizabeth \"Bitsy\" Dockering, third daughter of a viscount, is enjoying her second spectacular Season in London. She is a Diamond of the Season and is adored by all\u2014and especially by her precious black poodle, Galahad. To everyone else, however, Galahad is a demon dog. So much so that Bitsy's most insistent beau and particular victim of Galahad's bad manners has hired a thief to steal the dog, clearing the way for his suit. But none of them can plan for a chaotic encounter in the park, resulting in lost notes, a soaking in the Serpentine, and an accidental dog swap...and Lancelot being kidnapped instead of Galahad! Determined to locate the dog, Michael isn't thrilled to be saddled with a flighty female insisting on helping, except that Bitsy has a great deal more sense than he expected\u2014and a sharp tongue to match. Still, what's a scientist to do but continue to pursue an outcome, however unexpected it may be? But chemistry is all about attraction, and this is one formula with some hilariously romantic results.

                "Clueless  meets Bridgerton in this spicy opposites-attract Regency romance told with \"self-assured style, wit, and energy\" (Lisa Kleypas,  New York Times  bestselling author).    Lady Vesper Lyndhurst is beautiful, clever, and popular. Afforded every luxury as a duke's daughter, she fills her days with friends, intrigues, and a self-professed knack for matchmaking. She may have sworn off love for herself, but she is rather excellent at arranging it.    Faced with an insolvent estate, the Duke of Greydon has no choice but to return to England in a final attempt to revive his family's fortunes. He's been gone for years, happy to have escaped his mother and the petty circles of the ton. To his dismay, not much has changed, including the beautiful and vexing heiress next door.    But when an accident of fate traps the friends-turned-enemies in an attic together, the explosive attraction between them becomes impossible to ignore and even harder to resist. They are total opposites and their lives don't align in the slightest, but fate, the ultimate matchmaker, appears to have other plans . . .    \"Refreshing, steamy, and stocked with characters you don't normally get to see in the genre\u2014a must-read author.\" \u2014Jodi Picoult, #1  New York Times  bestselling author.

                "A delightful novel about alien invasions, conspiracies, and the incredibly silly things people are willing to believe\u2014some of which may actually be true\u2014from the Nebula and Hugo award-winning author of  Blackout  and  All Clear    \u201cAn absolute blast with abundant humor, copious references to old westerns, and . . . a delightful, intergalactic twist on the romantic comedy.\u201d\u2014 Publishers Weekly  (starred review)  When level-headed Francie arrives in Roswell, New Mexico, for her college roommate\u2019s UFO-themed wedding\u2014complete with a true-believer bridegroom\u2014she can\u2019t help but roll her eyes at all the wide-eyed talk of aliens, which obviously don\u2019t exist. Imagine her surprise, then, when she is abducted by one.  Odder still, her abductor is far from what the popular media have led her to expect, with a body like a tumbleweed and a mass of lightning-fast tentacles. Nor is Francie the only victim of the alien\u2019s abduction spree. Before long, he has acquired a charming con man named Wade, a sweet little old lady with a casino addiction, a retiree with a huge RV and a love for old Westerns, and a UFO-chasing nutjob who is thoroughly convinced the alien intends to probe them and/or take over the planet. But the more Francie gets to know the alien, the more convinced she becomes that he\u2019s not an invader. That he\u2019s in trouble and she has to help him. Only she doesn\u2019t know how\u2014or even what the trouble is.\u00a0  Part alien-abduction adventure, part road trip saga, part romantic comedy,  The Road to Roswell  is packed full of Men in Black, Elvis impersonators, tourist traps, rattlesnakes, chemtrails, and Close Encounters of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth kind. Can Francie, stuck in a neon green bridesmaid\u2019s dress, save the world\u2014and still make it back for the wedding?. "

While her older sisters have sought out adventure, Lady Madeline Vivers is content to be the conventional one in the family. A respectable husband, spring and autumn in Town, a place in the country-these are Madeline's reasonable goals.

Yet, somehow he's convinced that Madeline is just the helpmate he needs . . . The moment Harry witnesses Madeline gently convincing a shopkeeper to hire the child who is stealing from him, he's intrigued. If only she realized how much good they could do together, aiding their fellow countrymen and women. And the way her color deepens at his touch tells him she too feels their intense attraction. In fact, Harry has never felt so powerful an attraction either. What better reasons to use all his gifts of persuasion to convince her she belongs by his side-and in his arms . . . Contains mature themes. "

Zora has committed every inch of her life to establishing her thriving DC bookstore, making it into a pillar of the community, and she just hasn't had time for romance. But when a mystery author she's been crushing on for years agrees to have an event at her store, she starts to rethink her priorities. Lawrence is every bit as charming as she imagined, even if his understanding of his own books seems just a bit shallow. When he asks her out after his reading, she's almost elated enough to forget about the grumpy guy who sat next to her making snide comments all evening. Apparently the grouch is Lawrence's best friend, Reid, but she can't imagine what kind of friendship that must be. They couldn't be more different. But as she starts seeing Lawrence, and spending more and more time with Reid, Zora finds first impressions can be deceiving. Reid is smart and thoughtful\u2014he's also interested. After years of avoiding dating, she suddenly has two handsome men competing for her affection. But even as she struggles to choose between them, she can't shake the feeling that they're both hiding something\u2014a mystery she's determined to solve before she can find her HEA. "

But when the kids blithely ponder skinning people to see if they're aliens, and his wife drags them all on a surprise road trip to Disney World, even steady Blaine begins to crack. Half a continent away, Heather floats in a Malibu pool and watches the massive ships hover overhead. Maybe her life is finally going to start. For her, the arrival heralds a quest to understand herself, her accomplished (and oh-so-annoying) stepfamily, and why she feels so alone in a universe teeming with life. Suddenly conscious and alert after twenty catatonic years, Oliver struggles to piece together his fragmented, disco-infused memories and make sense of his desire to follow a strange cat on a westward journey. Embracing the strangeness that is life in the twenty-first century, On Earth as It Is on Television is a rollicking, heartfelt tale of first contact that practically leaps off the planet. "

                "The women behind the popular, scandalous periodical Mrs. Goode's Magazine for Misses, also known as Goode's Guide to Misconduct, are daring, witty, clever, and wise, just like their publication ... especially in romance. Serving as the advice columnist \"Miss Busy B.\" for an often-subversive ladies' magazine is the perfect outlet for Daphne Burke's outspoken nature. But when she advises a young lady of the ton to break off her engagement to a notorious rake, the consequences take Daphne beyond the page and into her real life. Miles, Viscount Deveraux, sometimes known as \"that devil Deveraux,\" needs a respectable bride by the end of the Season, and he's bet a fortune that he can get one. Now, his fianc\u00e9e has not only changed her mind\u2014but done it publicly, in a letter to London's most infamous magazine. With the stakes high and time  short, it seems reasonable to him that the columnist responsible should come to his rescue and marry him instead. Fortunately for Miles, Daphne is eager to escape the pressures of the London marriage mart. She agrees to a courtship. But at the end of two weeks, she intends to turn him down in a big, splashy scandal that will ruin her reputation and set her free. There's just one shocking wrinkle: Who knew being ruined by a  rake could be so much fun?. "

Known as Agent A, Alice is the top operative within the Agency of Undercover Note Takers, a secret government intelligence group that is fortunately better at espionage than at naming itself. From managing deceptive witches to bored aristocratic ladies, nothing is beyond Alice\u2019s capabilities.

So when rumors of an assassination plot begin to circulate, she\u2019s immediately assigned to the case.\u00a0 But she\u2019s not working alone. Daniel Bixby, otherwise known as Agent B and Alice's greatest rival, is given the most challenging undercover assignment of his life\u2014 pretending to be Alice\u2019s husband. Together they will assume the identity of a married couple, infiltrate a pirate house party, and foil their unpatriotic plans.\u00a0 Determined to remain consummate professionals, Alice and Daniel must ignore the growing attraction between them, especially since acting on it might prove more dangerous than their target.

To Marry a Duke...   Once there were three Irish sisters\u2014Gwendolyn, Dara, and Elise\u2014who had to fend for themselves when their gambler of a father disappeared, leaving them with an unscrupulous cousin. Dara hatches a daring plan: they gamble what little they own to finance a London season. Her goal: to use their looks and their wits to find a duke to marry for each sister!  It seems her crazy plot might work when the sisters are declared the \"Incomparables\" of the Season. Dukes and lords line up at their door, but bold women and scandal always go hand in hand. Particularly when Dara's plans are challenged by the likes of Michael Brogan, who provokes Dara as much as he tempts her. The handsome, clever, and rising politician is definitely not a duke, but he's determined to teach her about ambition, men, and, above all, love, making Dara wonder if her plans are about to change.

While the members of the ton, and even the queen herself, praise her warm brown skin, perfect curls, and exquisite features, Aphrodite can\u2019t help but think that living up to the  literal  goddess of beauty is asking a bit much.

When Aphrodite\u2019s formidable mother summons her back to London to aid in her sister\u2019s debut, she has no choice but to acquiesce. But Aphrodite is determined to ignore one man in particular: Evander Eagleman, the Duke of Everely, the man who devastated her all those years ago. Yet why does her guileless heart still flutter at the sight of him? Evander Eagleman lost his chance for true love, but now that he is an unattached widower, he is determined to win back Aphrodite\u2019s trust\u2014and her hand in marriage. But just as the couple make strides to mend old wounds, Evander\u2019s true reason for rejecting Aphrodite threatens their coveted future . . . and even their lives. "

What would  you  propose?   Clemency Fry has always been certain that marriage is a ludicrous arrangement\u2014a notion she has believed ever since reading a scandalous feminist treatise as a girl. But her outlook on romance suddenly changes after meeting the handsome Lord Boyle. With promises of a different sort of union, one with mutual respect and financial security for her family, Clemency is won over, but when the wedding is set and the plans are in motion, Lord Boyle turns cold and dismissive. Clemency fears the worst has come to fruition; she had been right all along about affairs of the heart. She has fallen into the one trap she swore she never would.\u00a0 Then Audric Ferrand comes to town seeking revenge against Lord Boyle on behalf of his sister, who also fell for his charm and wealth. Audric sees Clemency\u2019s predicament as the opportunity he needs. He suggests they join forces, a proposition that is risky and outrageous, and could possibly lead to the destruction of both their reputations. Falling in love was never in the bargain, but the season has just begun\u2014and romance is surely in the air. "

Bridgerton    meets  Gossip Girl  with a dash of Jane Austen, in this Regency-era historical romantic comedy with a deliciously feminist twist, from a hilarious British voice, Lex Croucher.  Abandoned by her parents, middle-class Georgiana Ellers is spending the summer with her stodgy aunt and uncle at their home in the English countryside. At a particularly dull party, she meets the enigmatic Frances Campbell, a wealthy member of the in-crowd who delights Georgiana with her disregard for so-called \"polite society.\" Lonely and vulnerable, Georgiana quickly falls in with Frances and her wealthy, wild, and deeply improper friends, who introduce her to the upper echelons of Regency aristocracy, and a world of drunken debauchery, frivolous spending, and mysterious young men. One, in particular, stands out from the rest: Thomas Hawksley, who has a tendency to cross paths with Georgiana in her most embarrassing moments. Sparks fly, but Thomas seems unimpressed with the company she is keeping. And soon, Georgiana begins to wonder whether she'll ever feel like she fits in\u2013\u2013or if the price of entry into Frances's gilded world will ultimately be higher than she is willing to pay. Set against a backdrop of lavish parties, handsome men on horseback\u2014and in a time when one's reputation was  everything\u2014 this edgy, hilarious romantic comedy explores sex, consent, belonging, and status through the eyes of an unforgettable heroine that Austen herself would have cheered for.   A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Griffin. "

                "From Timothy Zahn, Hugo Award winner and  New York Times  bestselling author of two landmark Star Wars\u00ae series, comes an\u00a0\u00a0original new tale featuring a renegade space pilot, his unusual alien partner, and an unknown cargo that can change the course of galactic history.  Jordan McKell has a problem with authority. Unfortunately for him, the iron-fisted authority of the powerful Patthaaunutth controls virtually every aspect of galactic shipping. In order to survive, Jordan ekes out a living dabbling in interstellar smuggling for outlaw concerns that represent the last vestiges of free trade in the galaxy. So when Jordan and his partner, Ixil\u2014an alien with two ferret-like \"outhunters\" linked to his neural system\u2014are hired by a mysterious gentleman to fly a ship and its special cargo to Earth, they jump at the job.  Caution has never been one of Jordan's strong suits. But this time he may have taken on more than even he can handle. The ship, Icarus, turns out to be a ramshackle hulk, the ragtag crew literally picked up off the street, and the cargo so secret, it's sealed in a special container that takes up most of the cramped and ill-designed ship. As if that weren't bad enough, it looks like the authorities already suspect something is afoot, there's a saboteur aboard, and the Icarus appears to be shaking apart at the seams.  It doesn't seem as if things could get any worse. That is, until a beautiful crew member helps McKell uncover the true nature of the cargo he's carrying. With his enemies closing in on the lumbering Icarus, the unknown saboteur still aboard, and authorities on Earth pressured to turn them in, McKell and Ixil become fugitives. Their only chance is to stay one step ahead of their pursuers as they try to make it home.  A bold and epic novel filled with unrelenting action and a good dose of humor,  The Icarus Hunt  is a wild hyperspace romp through the galaxy. "

Perfect for fans of Korman's Restart.    Mason and Ty were once the very best of friends, like two nerdy sides of the same coin . . . until seventh grade, when Ava Petrakis came along. Now Mason can trace everything bad in his life to that terrible fight they had over the new girl. The one thing he'd give anything for is a do-over. But that can't happen in real life\u2014can it?  As a science kid, Mason knows do-overs are impossible, so he can't believe it when he wakes up from a freak accident and finds himself magically transported back to seventh grade. His parents aren't yet divorced and his beloved sheepdog is still alive. Best of all, he and Ty haven't had their falling-out yet.  It makes no logical sense, but Mason is determined to use this second chance to not only save his friendship (and his dog!) but do other things differently\u2014like trying out for the football team and giving new friends a chance. There's just one person he'll be avoiding at all costs: Ava. But despite his best efforts, will he be able to stop the chain of events that made his previous life implode?. "

The Surprise of Her Life Sophisticated. Scandalous. In fact, Miss Sarah Hamilton, a proper Philadelphian, finds London society altogether shocking. How can it be that she has awakened from her innocent slumber to find herself in bed next to a handsome-and exceedingly naked-man? The laughing onlookers standing in the doorway are no help whatsoever and surely this amorous lunatic cannot be a duke, as he claims. She is compromised-though she most certainly will not marry him! The Sweetest Moment of His James, the Duke of Alford, is enchanted by his unexpected bedmate-and not at all afraid of her pink-cheeked fury. True, the circumstances and place of their meeting are most unusual, but the spirited American who's pummeling him with a pillow is an incomparable beauty. If Sarah will only listen to his perfectly reasonable explanation, James is sure that he can capture her heart . . . forever. Contains mature themes. "

It all starts with a note folded into the shape of an origami octopus:  \"Hi, Me. Yes, you.

It's got to be a joke. Except . . . the octopus is an origami fold Meade thought he invented. And the note writer has a lot of intel on him that nobody else should know. I mean, he's told his best friend Twig a lot about himself, but he's definitely kept mum about that time he sleepwalk-peed into his Lego container when he was six. Could Me Con be a real thing? And why does the origami stalker want him to go so badly anyway?. "

                "New York Times bestselling author Sarah MacLean returns with   a blazingly sexy, unapologetically feminist new series, Hell's Belles, beginning with a bold, bombshell of a heroine, able to dispose of a scoundrel\u2014or seduce one\u2014in a single night.    After years of living as London's brightest scandal, Lady Sesily Talbot has embraced the reputation and the freedom that comes with the title. No one looks twice when she lures a gentleman into the dark gardens beyond a Mayfair ballroom...and no one realizes those trysts are not what they seem.   No one, that is, but Caleb Calhoun, who has spent years trying not to notice his best friend's beautiful, brash, brilliant sister. If you ask him, he's been a saint about it, considering the way she looks at him...and the way she talks to him...and the way she'd felt in his arms during their one ill-advised kiss.    Except someone has to keep Sesily from tumbling into trouble during her dangerous late-night escapades, and maybe close proximity is exactly what Caleb needs to get this infuriating, outrageous woman out of his system. But now Caleb is the one in trouble, because he's fast realizing that Sesily isn't for forgetting...she's forever. And forever isn't something he can risk. "

It's late 1944. Hitler's rockets are raining down on London with vicious regularity and it's the coldest winter in living memory. The Allies are gaining ground, but victory is certainly dragging its feet.  In a large house next to Hampstead Heath, Vee Sedge is barely scraping by with a herd of lodgers to feed and her young charge Noel, almost fifteen now, to clothe and educate. When she witnesses an accident and finds herself in court, the repercussions are both unexpectedly marvelous and potentially disastrous. Because Vee is not actually the person she's pretending to be, and neither is Noel.  Victory is coming. Yet the end of the war won't just mean peace, but discovery . . .   With caustic wit and artful storytelling, Lissa Evans summons a time when the world could finally hope to emerge from the chaos of war. As witty as Old Baggage and poignant as Crooked Heart, V for Victory once again reveals Evans to be one of the most original and entertaining writers at work today. "

In 1970s Baltimore, fourteen-year-old Mary Jane loves cooking with her mother, singing in her church choir, and enjoying her family's subscription to the Broadway Showtunes of the Month record club. Shy, quiet, and bookish, she's glad when she lands a summer job as a nanny for the daughter of a local doctor. A respectable job, Mary Jane's mother says. In a respectable house.   The house may look respectable on the outside, but inside it's a literal and figurative mess: clutter on every surface, Impeachment: Now More Than Ever bumper stickers on the doors, cereal and takeout for dinner. And even more troublesome (were Mary Jane's mother to know, which she does not): the doctor is a psychiatrist who has cleared his summer for one important job\u2014helping a famous rock star dry out. A week after Mary Jane starts, the rock star and his movie star wife move in.    Over the course of the summer, Mary Jane introduces her new household to crisply ironed clothes and a family dinner schedule, and has a front-row seat to a liberal world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll (not to mention group therapy). Caught between the lifestyle she's always known and the future she's only just realized is possible, Mary Jane will arrive at September with a new idea about what she wants out of life, and what kind of person she's going to be.

The widowed Diana, Lady Templeton and Jeremy, Marquess of Willingham are infamous among English high society as much for their sharp-tongued bickering as their flirtation. One evening, an argument at a ball turns into a serious wager: Jeremy will marry within the year or Diana will forfeit one hundred pounds. So shortly after, just before a fortnight-long house party at Elderwild, Jeremy's country estate, Diana is shocked when Jeremy appears at her home with a very different kind of proposition.    After his latest mistress unfavorably criticized his skills in the bedroom, Jeremy is looking for reassurance, so he has gone to the only woman he trusts to be totally truthful. He suggests that they embark on a brief affair while at the house party\u2014Jeremy can receive an honest critique of his bedroom skills and widowed Diana can use the gossip to signal to other gentlemen that she is interested in taking a lover.    Diana thinks taking him up on his counter-proposal can only help her win her wager. With her in the bedroom and Jeremy's marriage-minded grandmother, the formidable Dowager Marchioness of Willingham, helping to find suitable matches among the eligible ladies at Elderwild, Diana is confident her victory is assured. But while they're focused on winning wagers, they stand to lose their own hearts.    With Martha Waters's signature \"cheeky charm and wonderfully wry wit\" (Booklist, starred review), To Love and to Loathe is another clever and delightful historical rom-com that is perfect for fans of Christina Lauren and Evie Dunmore.

He wants a prim and proper duchess, not the Wildest of the Wildes!   Already notorious for the golden hair that proves her mother's infidelity, Lady Joan can't seem to avoid scandals, but her latest escapade may finally ruin her: she's determined to perform the title role of a prince\u2014in breeches, naturally.  She has the perfect model for an aristocratic male in mind: Thaddeus Erskine Shaw, Viscount Greywick, a man who scorned the very idea of marrying her.  Not that Joan would want such a dubious honor, of course.  For years, Thaddeus has avoided the one Wilde who shakes his composure, but he's horrified when he grasps the danger Joan's putting herself in. Staring into her defiant eyes, he makes the grim vow that he'll keep her safe.  He strikes a bargain: after one performance, the lady must return to her father's castle and marry one of three gentlemen whom he deems acceptable.  Not including him, of course. "

But when the League encountered the Hokas, furry creatures strongly resembling the teddy bears of Earth, the League's agent, Alexander Jones, could have been excused for wishing he had a simpler assignment than making sense out of the Hokas-such as singlehandedly stopping an interstellar war. Not that the fuzzy aliens were unfriendly. In fact, they loved everything about humans, and adopted various Terram cultures wholesale and in every little detail-but with a bit of confusion about the differences between fact and fiction. So, if the Hokas suddenly started outing out the parts in a rip-roaring, shoot-em-up Western, or brought to life the London of Sherlock Holmes, complete with a pip-puffing, deerstalker-wearing Hoka, or suddenly decided to fly the Jolly Roger and lead a life of adventure and piracy on the high seas, mate-well, that was to be expected. And as the Hokas threw themselves wholeheartedly into progressively wilder worlds from Terran history and fiction, Jones could be excused for feeling that his grip on reality was hanging by a single, thin, increasingly frayed thread.

They say he's a healer, but she finds the heat of his touch does so much more...  Let his brothers get married\u2014Rory is too busy tending to the sick to be bothered with wooing a bride.

Rory makes it his mission to tend to her injuries and protect her, but the thought of losing her makes him realize that perhaps it is his heart that is most in need of healing... "

                "'I want you to remember something, Nat. You're small on the outside. But inside you're as big as everyone else. You show people that and you won't go far wrong in life.'    A compelling story perfect for fans of  The Doll Factory ,  The Illumination of Ursula Flight  and  The Familiars .    My name is Nat Davy. Perhaps you've heard of me? There was a time when people up and down the land knew my name, though they only ever knew half the story.    The year of 1625, it was, when a single shilling changed my life. That shilling got me taken off to London, where they hid me in a pie, of all things, so I could be given as a gift to the new queen of England.    They called me the queen's dwarf, but I was more than that. I was her friend, when she had no one else, and later on, when the people of England turned against their king, it was me who saved her life. When they turned the world upside down, I was there, right at the heart of it, and this is my story.    Inspired by a true story, and spanning two decades that changed England for ever,  The Smallest Man  is a heartwarming tale about being different, but not letting it hold you back. About being brave enough to take a chance, even if the odds aren't good. And about how, when everything else is falling apart, true friendship holds people together. "

There's nothing like a Black salesman on a mission.   An unambitious twenty-two-year-old, Darren lives in a Bed-Stuy brownstone with his mother, who wants nothing more than to see him live up to his potential as the valedictorian of Bronx Science. But Darren is content working at Starbucks in the lobby of a Midtown office building, hanging out with his girlfriend, Soraya, and eating his mother's home-cooked meals. All that changes when a chance encounter with Rhett Daniels, the silver-tongued CEO of Sumwun, NYC's hottest tech startup, results in an exclusive invitation for Darren to join an elite sales team on the thirty-sixth floor.  After enduring a \"hell week\" of training, Darren, the only Black person in the company, reimagines himself as \"Buck,\" a ruthless salesman unrecognizable to his friends and family. But when things turn tragic at home and Buck feels he's hit rock bottom, he begins to hatch a plan to help young people of color infiltrate America's sales force, setting off a chain of events that forever changes the game.  Black Buck  is a hilarious, razor-sharp skewering of America's workforce; it is a propulsive, crackling debut that explores ambition and race, and makes way for a necessary new vision of the American dream.
