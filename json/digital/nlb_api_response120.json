                "Are you still playing a role you learned in childhood to please others, such as the Good Girl/Boy, the Overachiever, or the Helper? Though these kinds of roles may have gained us attention and affection, they prohibited us from becoming our true selves.  People-pleasing\u2014putting others ahead of ourselves to avoid something negative or to get something we want or need\u2014runs rampant in our society. Saying yes when we should say no leaves us stuck in frustrating patterns. And when we don't say yes authentically, we say it resentfully, which leads to more problems than if we'd said no in the first place.  The Joy of Saying No will help you identify your people-pleasing style and habits. A six-step framework then teaches you how to discover the healing and transformative power of no to  establish healthier boundaries,  foster more intimate relationships and fulfilling experiences, and  reconnect with your values and authentic self.

As the millennial generation moves into their parenting years, posting on social media about milestones, memories, and good times is almost second nature. Families can seem \"perfect,\" and some parenting methods are heralded as \"the best.\" However, behind closed doors, many parents and caregivers struggle greatly no matter what method or combination of parenting methods they use. There are points where it seems like you've tried everything. Maybe it even feels hopeless. That's where  A Parent's Guide to Self-Regulation  comes in.    This book will demystify the concepts of dysregulation and parental self-regulation, and will normalize prioritizing these skills for parents, before bringing the concepts into parenting children. With this book's step-by-step framework, you will learn how to mitigate tough parenting moments, develop self-regulatory skills, and read real accounts from other parents. From addressing societal myths about dysregulated parenthood to tips on re-parenting yourself for better regulation and everything in-between, this book will serve as both a friendly companion and a source of solid, evidence-based advice.     A Parent's Guide to Self-Regulation  is written by Dr. Amber Thornton, a clinical psychologist and mother of two, who knows what it feels like to struggle with dysregulation and self-regulation as a parent.

Like many children of immigrants, she has often found herself plagued by questions: Can I establish my own values  and  embrace where I come from? Is prioritizing my mental health really rejecting my culture? How do I set boundaries and care for myself when family and community mean everything? Even after becoming a therapist herself, she saw those same gaps in the mental health world, leading her to wonder, like so many children of immigrants: what about us? While conversations around mental health are becoming increasingly open, our models remain largely Eurocentric and focused on individuality. Sahaj has sought to challenge these long-held models, using deep personal reflection, therapy, community building, and a whole lot of trial and error, eventually navigating her own way to understanding and acceptance. Here, she shows us how to get there, all the while reminding us that personal healing is inextricably connected to collective healing.  But What Will People Say?  elegantly weaves together personal narrative, anecdotal analysis, and comprehensive research. Sahaj offers advice and tools for everything from navigating generational trauma, guilt, and boundaries, to breaking down stigmas around therapy and celebrating cultural duality. Democratizing and decolonizing the way we think about mental health and self-help, Sahaj\u2019s incredible work is nothing short of a revolution. "

Rethink your understanding of mental health, update your views on happiness and come closer to realizing your potential.' Adam Grant, #1  New York Times  bestselling author of  Hidden Potential   Do you feel demotivated and aimless? Are you running on empty? Is it hard to pinpoint what's wrong? Millions of us are struggling with this emotional state of weariness, and until now, we've lacked the vocabulary to understand it. But Dr Corey Keyes has identified this feeling as  languishing , and here he draws on the latest research and real-life case studies to trace its spread to a level of global epidemic, asking the fundamental question of how we find lasting wellbeing. Breaking down the science of emotional exhaustion, Keyes shows that our very obsession with happiness complicates the process of finding it. Only by shifting our focus from  feeling good  to  functioning well  can we unlock the key to flourishing. He reveals the choices and mental habits that inadvertently worsen the problem, and shares simple but powerful steps anyone can take to restore meaning, joy, and calm to their lives.   Languishing  is a must-read for anyone tempted to downplay the demotivation and emptiness they've been feeling, to help build a buffer against the pressures of modern life and find true flourishing.

Until there is a clear understanding that true productivity begins when the narrative is switched to a proactive mindset, 82% will continue to wallow in time managed obscurity.    The Time Optimized Life  reframes the reactive nature of time management and replaces it with a proactive method of time optimization. Drawing from exclusive data captured by a tool called the Time Management Analysis (TMA), the book walks the reader through a comprehensive system that is easily adaptable to a particular personality or experience level.   Using it as a complete time overhaul,  The Time Optimized Life  allows the reader the flexibility to create a time optimization plan that meets their essential needs. Operating with tools readily available to them today, the book will change perceptions of the individual and their approach to the use of their time, without having to invest in new gadgets or software.  Time is a commodity and resource that does not stop. It can't be reversed, and you can't go back and get more. Investing time reading and applying the content in  The Time Optimized Life  will help the reader make the future feel more infinite. "

                "A unique approach to healing that emphasizes changing our perspectives instead of changing ourselves. Instead of struggling to change our inner experiences, we transform the container in which they are held. From here, wholeness and healing are possible; this is where actual change lives.  One of the most significant sources of suffering comes from our human tendency to avoid difficult emotions. We are not taught how to face these unpleasant, often daily inner experiences (mind-body energies) and so we tend to push them away, ignore them, or become unwittingly overwhelmed by them. Yet how we meet and greet these difficult emotions has everything to do with our well-being, resilience, and ability to connect with ourselves and others.Instinctually, we fight against our uncomfortable emotions; in doing so, we reinforce messages of \"not good enough\" or \"something is wrong with me that I am feeling this way.\"    In  You Don't Have to Change to Change Everything , readers learn that instead of forcing themselves to feel \"happy\" and pushing away what is unpleasant, or instead of getting hooked by intense emotions,another path can lead to more profound well-being. Rather than trying to change one's inner experiences, this book offers six ways to shift one's vantage point when difficult emotions arise. Being aware from each of these six vantage points allows readers to cultivate inner stability, willingness to turn toward rather than away from themselves, greater perspective, internal strengths and inner resources, self-compassion, connection with the \"Whole Self\" versus identification with \"hole self,\" and interconnection with the world around them.

                "Motivation expert James Fell teaches readers how to skip the hard part and go directly from intention to committed action.   After years of helping people change, James Fell had a sudden insight about sudden insight: significant life change doesn't often come from just putting one foot in front of the other, carefully observing and altering habits, slogging through baby steps toward new behavior. Rather, the research reveals that serious life turnaround usually happens in a moment, with a flash of inspiration. Epiphany arrives like a lightning strike, rapidly shifting the recipient of such enlightenment onto a new path that creates a better life. Motivational psychology has traditionally focused on slow and steady\u2014gradual improvement over time to reach a desired goal, whether it's weight loss, career change, battling addiction, or success in relationships. We've been told since toddlerhood that the tortoise beats the hare. But, through compelling science and powerful stories, James Fell shows us that the hare has the edge; overwhelming desire can be awakened fast and furiously. When you learn to become attuned to that sensation of sudden awakening, a new path can be followed almost effortlessly, because it feels like destiny. Everyone has the ability to experience the lightning strike.  The Holy Sh!t Moment  will teach you how to create a life-changing epiphany and go directly from intention to action. "

                "\"A provocative and revealing perspective.\" - Booklist  Shows how mental distress is often caused by relationship imbalance, not chemical imbalance.   Diagnosis Human offers a compelling alternative to the biomedical model of mental health as it's been promoted over the last 30 years\u2014a model which says that mental distress is a problem of chemical imbalance, or brain chemistry. Promoted by the highly profitable Psychiatry/Pharmaceutical industrial complex, and followed by much of the broader psychotherapy community, biological psychiatry focuses on quantifying the \"illness\" by an almost exclusive focus on symptoms. In this model, symptoms are never good. They are always seen as a sign that something is wrong with that person, a sign of pathology that must be changed. People now have a name for what they \"have\" and receive a prescription for it.  What may appear as intractable individual problems, however, often aren't individual problems at all. This book reveals how many of these distressing emotional states are created by nearly invisible, intimate patterns in our relationships. Diagnosis: Human invites readers into the therapist's office to be part of family therapy sessions, where they can experience practically first-hand what these intimate relationship patterns look and feel like. The authors present cases of adults dealing with depression, couples who come to therapy reeling from the betrayal of an affair, families with kids diagnosed with ADHD, teenagers with anxiety or young children with temper tantrums. Each therapy session includes the voice of the therapist, inviting readers to sit in as observers to watch and listen as the case unfolds, sometimes in dramatic fashion. "

                "Provides a broad and entertaining overview of fear from evolution, to modern day challenges, and how clinicians treat trauma, anxiety, and PTSD today.  About a third of the world population suffers from an anxiety disorder, and half of Americans have had at least one traumatic experience like rape, assault, shooting, or natural disasters. The news is full of stories about our dying planet, civil unrest, political fighting, and other anxiety-inducing subjects. On social media, digital tribes have lined up against each other and people worry they may get \"canceled\" for any number of perceived offenses. Fear and anxiety are with us everywhere we go.  Fear is one of the most deeply rooted biological mechanisms that has evolved over hundreds of millions of years in the brains and bodies of animals and humans with one key mission: to increase our chance of survival. Fear is deeply woven into our biology, culture, politics, and day to day life. We sometimes don't even know what we are afraid of. What we know for sure is that we are afraid too often.  But why are we so scared? How does fear work in our brains? Why does our body react the way it does when we are scared? What is the evolutionary purpose of fear? Why do we enjoy watching horror movies? How does the brain of a brave person work differently than others? How do we learn to be afraid, and how can we unlearn? Is fear good or bad for creativity? Can we use fear to our advantage? How is fear used to manipulate us?   In this book, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist answers these questions. It is a comprehensive review of fear and anxiety in most tangible aspects of the modern life. Arash Javanbakht explores how our childhood experiences define the role fear plays in us as adults, how fear may or may not affect our genes, what excessive fear and anxiety can do to our brains and bodies, and the role of fear in the wake of trauma. Readers will come away with a better understanding of fear and how we can tamp its negative effects, how we can treat it medically if necessary, and how we can protect ourselves from fear's most negative consequences.

                "Coping with anger and pain is more challenging than ever in these times\u2014and more necessary. Two acclaimed Buddhist teachers offer strategies and wisdom in a book that\u2019s been called \u201cpossibly the most inspiring and liberating meditation on love ever written.\u201d   When people and circumstances upset us, how do we deal with them? Often, we feel victimized. We become hurt, angry, and defensive. We end up seeing others as enemies, and when things don\u2019t go our way, we become enemies to ourselves. But what if we could move past this pain, anger, and defensiveness? Inspired by Buddhist philosophy, this book introduces us to the four kinds of enemies we encounter in life: the outer enemy, people, institutions, and situations that mean to harm us; the inner enemy, anger, hatred, fear, and other destructive emotions; the secret enemy, self-obsession that isolates us from others; and the super-secret enemy, deep-seated self-loathing that prevents us from finding inner freedom and true happiness. In this practical guide, we learn not only how to identify our enemies, but more important, how to transform our relationship to them.  Love Your Enemies  teaches us how to . . .  \u00b7  break free from the mode of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d thinking  \u00b7  develop compassion, patience, and love  \u00b7  accept what is beyond our control  \u00b7  embrace lovingkindness, right speech, and other core concepts First published in 2013,  Love Your Enemies  is, more than ever, required reading for navigating our world. Throughout, authors Sharon Salzberg and Robert Thurman draw from ancient spiritual wisdom and modern psychology to help you find peace within yourself and with the world.  * Includes new prefaces from both authors *.

Is it possible to have hundreds of followers on social media but still feel isolated? To live in a city of millions of people but find yourself alone? No one really wants to admit it, but the answer is certainly 'yes'. So, let's talk about loneliness. Human connection specialist Simone Heng knows a lot about being lonely. She left an enviable career and social life to move back to her family home to care for her mother. All alone in a house filled with memories but devoid of people, she was faced with the realization that human connection is one of our most essential needs. There's a global loneliness epidemic. Every one of us has experienced feeling lonely, even if we don't realize it. The modern world has changed how we live and the 'village' environment with spontaneous connection has been replaced by remote work and contrived relationships. Most importantly, the old stereotypes of what loneliness looks like no longer hold true \u2014 in a world where technology has made us more 'connected' than ever before, people of all ages are feeling alone. Simone shares her journey to understanding the value of human connection and explains how to distinguish authentic relationships from fake substitutes. This definitive book on loneliness shows us how to build meaningful relationships with those that matter the most, forge new friendships, and create the genuine connections we all crave. "

                "A guide to emotional healing and living a more self-accepting life.  Behind many of our problems lies an often ignored factor: we don't like ourselves very much. We are sufferers of self-hatred. We tell ourselves the meanest things. It's because of self-hatred that we tend to neglect our potential at work and get entangled in unfulfilling relationships, that we lack confidence in our social lives and suffer from anxiety, despair and imposter syndrome. This is a book that, with immense compassion and fellow feeling, investigates the phenomenon of self-hatred while giving pragmatic advice on how to overcome it. It asks where the feeling comes from, what it makes us do and how we might become kinder and more compassionate towards ourselves. We have probably spent far too much of our lives disliking ourselves and attacking everything we say, do or feel, while not even realizing what we're up to. It's time to overcome our masochism and move towards a more self-forgiving and accepting stance. The School of Life: On Self Hatred   is a guide to the more compassionate and gentle relationship we should have had with ourselves from the start, and can all achieve now.        IDENTIFIES THE ORIGINS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SELF-HATRED:  and provides advice for living a more self-accepting life.   ENCOURAGES US TO DEVELOP ASSERTIVENESS AGAINST SELF-LOATHING:  and  gives us the tools to challenge our inner critic and deal with imposter syndrome.   ACCESSIBLE AND PRAGMATIC:  with a compassionate and realistic  tone, outlining the importance of self-care.   PART OF THE SCHOOL OF LIFE'S SERIES OF GIFTABLE ESSAYS:  other titles  include: Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person, On Confidence,  How to Find Love and Self-Knowledge. "

                "An exploration of the many reasons to remain hopeful in the face of life's disappointments and challenges.  In a world that isn't short of darkness, there could be few more urgent priorities than to spend time rehearsing for ourselves why life \u2013 despite all its challenges \u2013 still has so much to offer us; why there are still so many reasons to be hopeful. Here is a collection of some of the most persuasive arguments for staying on the side of optimism, creativity, kindness, calm and hope. Across a series of essays, we learn why we still have the right to feel purposeful and buoyant despite everything that is challenging: because there is still so much more to discover, because love can triumph sometimes, because we can delight in summer days and the light of dawn, because we are not alone in our suffering, because we are never far from the option of a slice of cake or a bath, because we are very small things in a mighty and beautiful universe and because we don't require perfection for things to feel good enough. In a tone that avoids the pitfalls of sentimentality and cynicism, the book urges us to reconnect with our more resilient selves, bidding us to recover faith in what is still possible. At points funny and always encouraging and kind, here is an ideal friend to guide us back to courage and delight.      A TOOL TO ASSIST US IN OUR SEARCH FOR A REASON TO BE:  the book is an eclectic collection of short essays on wide-ranging subjects, from an extraordinary encounter between Mick Jagger and an unfamiliar Jesuit priest to the escapism found in Iranian cinema.   HOPEFULNESS FOR PESSIMISTS:  an honest and accessible guide to navigate us through the darkness to light.   ILLUSTRATED THROUGHOUT:  with a vibrant mix of artworks, photography and illustration.   A HIGHLY RELATABLE BOOK:  that offers comfort and support in our darker moments,   while guiding us towards an optimistic future. "

                "A straightforward look at the history and the art of maintaining courteous communication in an increasingly divided world.  Have you ever been in a conversation that, after volleying back and forth, ended with the words,  \"I'm just saying . . .\"?  Usually, this signals frustration, that the discussion has reached a dead end, that you haven't made your point, and may even leave you feeling that your relationship with the other person has changed for the worse. Digital interactions, devoid of nuance and understanding, further complicate discussion. We may believe that we are superior because our opinions are the \"right\" ones, and in the future avoid conversations with those whose opinions differ from ours, sending us into a never-ending echo chamber.   In  I'm Just Saying,  author Milan Kordestani shows us that although challenging conversations can be unpleasant, they can also help us grow. Sometimes, people inspire us to change how we speak, making us better communicators in the process as we search to find common ground with those with whom we disagree. Kordestani uses contemporary case studies and personal experience to teach readers how to have constructive conversations by engaging in civil discourse\u2014the idea that good-faith actors can reach consensus on any opinion-based disagreement. He discusses influential leaders and reflects on his successes and failures in creating The Doe, an online publication focused on civil discourse. He addresses the challenges that digital media consumption presents when seeking common ground\u2014especially when people are only digitally connected.   Civil discourse, an essential part of democracy, is becoming rare in today's digital age.  I'm Just Saying  examines discourse's successes and the ways to rebuild it. Drawing from history, popular culture, and personal anecdotes, the book promotes effective civil discourse by providing practical advice and strategies for respect. Through story,  I'm Just Saying  offers insight and tools for politeness in a divided world. "

                "An inspirational guide to the 6 core qualities of healthy communities, for anyone looking to build community as a source of connection and a vehicle for social change  After two years meeting with different communities in the US, psychologist Lisa Kentgen identified 6 key traits of vibrant, healthy communities that we can all apply to our own lives and networks:  Commitment to care  Acceptance  Diversity  Skillful conflict resolution  Bonding rituals  Hospitality  Each chapter focuses on one of these traits, highlighting a particular community as a case study of how it can be put into practice. You\u2019ll learn about a wide range of successful community models, including a tiny-home village for people who had been chronically houseless in Austin, Texas; a study circle to build connection between Native and non-Native people in a small town in South Dakota; a 500-member community choir in Columbus, Ohio; and a Buddhist center in Barre, Massachusetts committed to bringing greater diversity to the Dharma. Throughout the book, you\u2019ll reflect: How can we cultivate these traits of vibrant community in our own lives? What would it look like to prioritize caring and acceptance in our interactions with others? How can we create a climate of true inclusivity, one where our differences both challenge and strengthen us? How can we learn to feel more comfortable with tension and acquire the skills to move through conflict toward creative solutions? What would happen if we incorporated meaningful rituals into our communities and made a point of celebrating each other?\u00a0 With intention and practice, we can transform our social relationships and build communities that appreciate difference, encourage authentic expression, and foster an environment of belonging and mutual care. This book will inspire you to make the transformative leap from \u201cme\u201d to \u201cwe,\u201d creating communal, loving spaces in which to connect\u2014and thrive\u2014together. "

In each chapter, Rose draws from her personal experience as a teacher and facilitator of creative mindfulness to share stories and examples that help ground exercises like sketching, creative writing prompts, and more. Rose carefully walks through the process each time, explaining how to set intention and arrive in the present moment before embarking on your mindful art session; how to use objects and thoughts as creative prompts; how to return your attention to your work as you move forward; and how to distill the wisdom you have found in the process.\u00a0 For seasoned artists, creative mindfulness offers a chance to slow down and rediscover the transformative power that art can offer when it is detached from the need to produce something beautiful or useful. For those coming to expressive arts with existing mindfulness practices or engaged in a therapeutic process, a mindful arts practice may reveal a passion for creation you didn\u2019t know existed. And for everyone, creative mindfulness can help us make sense of our feelings and find new ways of expressing ourselves\u2014in art and in life. "

                "A groundbreaking book detailing the unique issues experienced by adult children who grew up with a sexually addicted parent, and offering a path to unburden their shameful legacy and embrace sexuality and intimacy without the intrusion or constraints from the past.  Adult children who grew up with a parent who had a sexual addiction are left confused, ashamed, and mistrustful regarding the feelings and boundaries surrounding sex, love, and intimacy. Due to the inappropriate sexual behavior of one parent, and the subsequent impact of betrayal on the other parent, these adults carry sexual secrets, have divided loyalties, and are often caught in the middle of their parents' struggles. Having witnessed (or known of) affairs, walked in on a parent masturbating or viewing pornography, received extreme or shameful messages regarding sexuality or gender, experienced sexualized remarks about their bodies, been neglected as a result of the addiction, or were modeled extreme moral values (either too permissive or shaming), these adult children of sex addicts (ACSAs) struggle with their sexuality and longings for love.    ACSAs have not had their stories told in any significant way in the recovery literature. Intergenerational trauma is transmitted through the legacy of carried sexual shame\u2014the burden of which is not theirs. Their shame and struggle has often been wedged under various umbrellas of identification: adult children of alcoholics, love avoidant, codependent, sex addict, love addict, and others.  A Light in the Dark  offers hope for unburdening ACSAs by sharing the experiences of others, as well as examining the characteristics, roles and recovery that point toward the freedom and joy they rightfully deserve.

                "Many of us today are addicted to \"self-help\" books, videos, seminars and almost anything about any area of life that we could possibly need to improve. They all have one thing in common. They tell us what is possible, if we want it, seek it, work for it, pray for it, and believe in it badly enough.     What they DON'T tell us is that there are things that we CAN'T do\u2014no matter how fervently we want, seek, work, pray, or believe. These things are the \"can'ts.\" They are life's impossibilities, things we will not accomplish, rewards we will never realize.   Over the years, author Steve Gottry has discovered 13 significant \"you can'ts.\" These 13 are deceptively simple. They are also simply deceptive. Most of us, in failing to achieve them, feel that we have been defeated by events and circumstances that we should have been able to control. But the problem has nothing to do with our inability to control things around us, and everything to do with how we deal with, and eventually accept, what we can and can't do.   This book is about living a life of contentment, by moving beyond your expectations and limitations. Understanding, and accepting these thirteen limitations, you will be free to maximize your potential in ways you never imagined possible. You'll live your own life, rather than trying to live the lives of those around you, and you may also find subtle, simple ways to help those you love find happiness, too. Now is the perfect time to discover the 13 \"you can'ts.\" "

Many focus their desire for love and wholeness outside themselves and onto others, such as their partners, only to feel disappointed that they don't get back what they give. Does this ring true for you? With  I Love Me More , entrepreneur, speaker, and single mom Jenna Banks crushes the myths about how we should relate to ourselves. She wants to help you stop freely giving all your power away and start understanding your worth. Jenna uses highly relatable examples from her life story to convey important messages about how you can live a fuller, more rewarding life by embracing your own value and power.  I Love Me More  details valuable, empowering lessons, including:  You must love yourself more than anyone else.  It's okay to say no.  Don't look for external approval. What you feel about yourself is what matters most.  How you treat yourself is how you will be treated by others.  Always trust your intuition, even when it makes no sense.  Your relationship with yourself is the most important relationship you'll ever have.   Jenna's down-to-earth, personable voice guides you through topics such as defining self-love, the ways we sabotage self-love, how to put yourself first, how to use self-love to be valued at work, how to balance caring for yourself and caring for others, and much more. Following Jenna's lead, you'll learn to embrace your inner warrior goddess!. "

A great many books and articles have been written on money \u2013 what it is, how to earn it, how to spend it, who has it and who does not, and a myriad of other topics related to the effects that it produces. Money is one of the most fascinating, thought provoking, emotional, polarizing, and well-researched subjects in the world. Yet, despite the constant focus on it, the average person's views about money and how best to become rich is confusion. There is so much disinformation that most people rely on chance for their wealth. That leaves a great deal of untapped human potential that is never realized. It's also totally unnecessary, because the way to create, invest, and spend money wisely is known and the methods have been proven again and again by people who are easily making a fortune. In writing this book, Brian Tracy had one goal: to show you too can earn money faster and easier than ever before. If you simply study his ideas in this book and apply them to your life and your business, you too can get rich now. Learn how to:  Manage spending and debt   Generate income   Generate wealth   Multiply wealth   Protect your wealth Brian Tracy is Chairman and CEO of Brian Tracy International, which specializes in the training and development of individuals and organizations. He has consulted for more than 1,000 companies and addressed more than 5,000,000 people in 5,000 talks and seminars throughout the world. "

                "Expand your EI to make courageous decisions and transform your life based on Patrick Kilcarr's EQ-I 2.0 tool and his 'Master Trainer' status.      Our emotional intelligence (EI) is an intensely personal inner landscape. It is an intricate interplay of self-regard, empathy, resilience, and other key competencies essential to leading a fulfilled and balanced personal and professional life. While it is unique for each one of us, taking into account our formative experience growing up and the myriad of others experiences we encountered up to this moment in time, there are specific emotions and behaviors that suggest we either are, or are not, socially and emotionally balanced. Our personal history is inescapable; what is not is our ability to direct the life we want from this point forward.  Yet the measure of emotional intelligence largely has been the province of educators, CEOs, entrepreneurs, and human resources professionals. They are keenly interested in how the concept plays out in educational and professional settings, and their assessments aim at maximizing organization integration and performance.   The problem is clear. If emotional intelligence is rooted in the individual, how can we use its assessment as a map for self-understanding and as leverage to immediate and future growth? A strong hunger exists among ordinary people to harness the extraordinary power of emotional intelligence as a pathway to personal transformation. Guides to accomplish this vital task in personal growth are few. While there is a great deal written \"about\" emotional intelligence, a gap exists demonstrating what it looks and feels like to achieve and maintain emotional intelligence, especially if our formative years were paved with drama, trauma and disappointment. This book brings to the reader how an emotionally intelligent life can be achieved if there is a desire for it. "

Terri thinks her feelings of isolation will end with her marriage to her childhood sweetheart and their move from a farm town to the city of Chicago.

Adrift, Terri contemplates suicide. Could a move to different city, to a fresh start, solve her problem?

After starting therapy, her curiosity leads her into four years of soul-searching conversations with America's leading psychologists and psychiatrists about how to cope with loneliness, why it is a normal and necessary stage of healthy growth, and how to stop resisting it. She explores with growing understanding intimate details of her dreams, her past traumas, and her role in her own loneliness\u2014and learns not only how to live comfortably with that loneliness but how to use it to her advantage.

The list of daily tasks that need to be completed continues to grow longer and the pressure of time slipping away makes people stressed and anxious. People's perspectives shift away from thinking about others, creating distance between them and the rest of the world. This distance causes people to lose touch with the basic human values that everyone shares and that assist in developing meaning and connection in their lives. Integrity, kindness, compassion, and love are gifts that go dormant when people cease to use their power to cultivate and nurture them. The outcome is that they stop treating one another with respect, love, dignity, and acceptance and instead live their lives sitting in judgement, being fearful and giving up their peace. Live Your Humanity teaches readers how to overcome these obstacles by detailing how to activate the human values that they already have. When they do this, they experience a life free of fear and judgment and instead realize a life of meaning and connection. "

If you're one of millions who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), you're all-too-familiar with feelings of anxiety, panic, shame, and uncertainty. In addition, the stigma associated with OCD can make you feel unworthy of receiving the compassion and kindness you need and deserve. You may even experience unwanted intrusive thoughts that result in harsh self-judgment\u2014which can actually hinder your recovery and lead to additional mental health problems. So, how can you break this destructive cycle and start feeling better?   The Self-Compassion Workbook for OCD  outlines a step-by-step program to help you understand the emotional experience of OCD, and develop the tools you need to manage your disorder and build a better life. Drawing on a powerful combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure and response prevention (ERP), and compassion-focused therapy (CFT), this breakthrough guide will teach you how to balance intense emotions, lean into your fear, and focus on recovery. Over time, you'll learn to replace self-judgment with kindness and self-compassion, so you can stop suffering and start thriving.  Living with OCD can be extremely challenging, but it doesn't have to rob you of your self-worth. You are so much more than your disorder! Let this book be your guide to discovering, supporting, and loving the best you that you can be. "

Threading in her own experiences, and in particular, what she took away from her twenties, Toni provides genuine and insightful advice on a whole array of topics.

This how-to guide shares\u00a0evidence-based\u00a0techniques to\u00a0go from being your own worst critic to your own best friend.   Perhaps you want to be nicer to yourself but don\u2019t really know how to get there. Or maybe you\u2019re someone who assumes self-criticism is a permanent part of your personality. Rest assured you\u2019re not alone\u2014millions of people struggle with the toll that excessive self-criticism takes\u00a0on their minds, energy levels, jobs, and\u00a0relationships. And problems with self-talk vary dramatically from one person to the next: they can appear as mild but persistent inner\u00a0criticism, full-blown self-loathing, or the\u00a0pain\u00a0of internalized\u00a0oppression or abuse.\u00a0 After over twenty years of working\u00a0with\u00a0individuals, groups, and classes on self-criticism and related challenges, psychologist and mindfulness teacher Dr. Rachel Goldsmith Turow offers the \u201cself-talk workout\u201d\u2014six\u00a0doable\u00a0exercises\u00a0that can\u00a0help you replace self-criticism with self-kindness and self-encouragement.\u00a0Specific self-talk strategies such as\u00a0\u201cSpot the success,\u201d \u201cFail forward,\u201d and \u201cAllowing all feelings, skillfully,\u201d require\u00a0just a few minutes a day. These skills can be practiced individually to\u00a0transform your self-talk, or you can choose to combine two or more exercises to enhance your self-talk workout.\u00a0Each chapter features a core exercise, variations on the strategy that might feel right for you, scientific studies supporting each approach, and success stories to inspire your own practice.\u00a0 Turow includes\u00a0examples from her own life and experiences as a psychotherapist, as well as lessons from her students and respected public figures such as Michelle Obama and Thich Nhat Hanh, to\u00a0show that\u00a0the\u00a0burden of harsh self-criticism need not go on forever: the\u00a0way that we relate to ourselves can be changed.

For many veterans, life after military service includes what feels like an ongoing mission to disguise or ignore pain. Too often this mission is both secret and lonely\u2014and undertaken without the support or even the knowledge of those around them.     Some strategies to manage physical, social, and psychological pain are only short-term fixes. Self-medicating, substance use, and bottling up emotions don't work as part of civilian life.     Written by professional practitioners in trauma, substance use disorder, pain management, and rehabilitation who are also members of the veteran community,  End Your Covert Mission  is an approachable, non-judgmental guide for stopping that self-imposed mission and developing solutions that lead to a healthier and happier life.     The book includes features that help readers discover a path to recovery:     - examples of the types of pain veterans may experience     - language for admitting, describing, and sharing these various types of pain     - personal stories from veterans     - effective approaches for connecting with other veterans and family members     - methods to address active substance use     - ways to identify and manage risk factors for future substance use disorders.

Creativity engages our imagination and opens us up to thinking differently. It frees us from the constraints of everyday life, allowing us to access a part of ourselves that is not ruled by time, pressures, or conditions. It's no wonder many of us long for more of it in our lives. When creative energy flows through us, it connects us to our deepest selves, as well as the world around us.  If you've ever embarked on a creative project, you may have experienced moments of pure joy or a sense of higher consciousness, when creativity seemed to pour from you. It's also likely you've encountered moments of feeling stuck or blocked, being full of fear and self-doubt, or just not seeing the point. The truth is, emotions have a way of powerfully disrupting our creative flow and dismantling our inspiration. And by examining how emotions affect creativity\u2014how entangled we can become in our own negative thoughts and beliefs\u2014we can learn to unblock channels of inspiration and reach our true creative potential.   Boundless Creativity  is designed to help writers, artists, and anyone feeling creatively blocked move beyond the self-doubt and criticism, past emotional wounds, and habits and patterns that keep you from realizing your artistic ambitions. Using a powerful technique called \"The Universal Story\"\u2014a four-phase program with easy-to-follow steps and exercises\u2014you'll learn to identify and dissolve the emotional and energetic blocks that get in the way of your creativity.  With these tips and tools, you'll have the keys to unlock creative inspiration, intuition, and new ways of seeing yourself and the world\u2014with acceptance, emotional balance, and a tolerance of imperfection.

This revolutionary guide provides the key to understanding the root cause of your anxiety, so you can break free from its grip.   Let's face it: anxiety can interfere with every single aspect of your life, from work and family to relationships and finances. Left unchecked, the cycle of anxiety reinforces and perpetuates itself over time, and can leave you feeling paralyzed with fear. You've probably attempted to \"get rid of\" or \"outrun\" your anxiety, only to find your symptoms growing even stronger. What you need is a new way to deal with anxiety: one that emphasizes  listening  to what your anxiety is trying to tell you.  In  What Happened to Make You Anxious? , anxiety expert Jaime Castillo offers a whole new approach; one that focuses less on avoiding or extinguishing anxiety, and more toward understanding and working with it to create a fulfilling, meaningful life. You'll learn how your anxiety is connected to what Castillo refers to as \"little 't' traumas\"\u2014seemingly small, unhealed traumas from your past that drive your fear and worry, so you can get to the root of your anxiety and start healing.  Your anxiety works overtime communicating perceived threats; this book will show you how to listen to anxiety, discern which threats are real, which don't fit the actual facts of the situation, and which are triggered by past events. Once you and your anxiety are on the same page, anxiety will loosen its grip\u2014freeing you up to live with clarity, confidence, and serenity.  You've tried managing it on your own. You may have even received treatment. If you're at your wit's end when it comes to your anxiety, this book will show you a new path toward lasting relief. "

In each chapter of  You're Going to Be Okay , author Madeline Popelka shares an insight that she gained along her healing journey that shifted her perspective, brought her comfort, reduced her shame, or helped her feel less alone. She weaves in her own personal stories throughout the book, providing readers with the encouragement to keep going so survivors can feel whole again after trauma has turned their world upside down. Readers will find help to release their shame and self-blame as Madeline shows that their experiences are valid, that they aren't \"crazy,\" and that their trauma wasn't their fault\u2014that it's never the victim's fault. They will learn why an experience that doesn't seem \"that bad\" can still have a profound effect, and that no matter how \"small\" their trauma may seem they deserve to heal. Many survivors feel like they've lost themselves to trauma, and it can seem impossible to find the upside of an experience that's so devastating.  You're Going to Be Okay  offers ways to heal that can help them find themselves, and even become improved versions of themselves. This empowering book encourages survivors to share their stories to help others feel less alone, once they're ready and able to, and reminds them that healing is a lifelong journey, and while it can be messy and uncomfortable, there are gifts to be found along the way.

                "For any woman who feels burned out, beaten down, or like she might break under the pressure, third-degree black belt and motivational coach of ABC's My Diet Is Better Than Yours teaches a unique brand of badassery\u2014how to get back up no matter what life throws at you; how to level up your mind, body and spirit; and how to turn your setbacks into secret weapons.  Jennifer Cassetta is a nationally recognized keynote speaker, health and empowerment coach, and a 3rd-degree black belt in Hapkido. After a brush with death on September 11th, 2001, three blocks south of the World Trade Center, and then fending off an attacker late one night months later, Jenn took a deep dive into martial arts training where she learned how to harness the power of mind, body, and spirit.    Now she teaches women from colleges to corporations how to unleash their inner badass by using dojo wisdom as a metaphor for life.     Whether the opponent is a financial hardship, a difficult boss, or being in a manipulative relationship, Cassetta teaches readers how to flex their mental muscle, how to rise above fears, and how to turn setbacks into superpowers.    Through thought-provoking exercises and no-holds-barred humor, she shows women how to close the door on blame and shame; how to grow from their Greatest (S)Hits List of life disappointments; and how to disarm and defend against the blocks that hold them back.    In life\u2014just like in martial arts\u2014we get pushed and pulled and kicked down. We get banged up and bruised and stretched to our limits. Cassetta champions women that while they may bend, they will not break, and that they have the power within them to rise up and stand tall.
