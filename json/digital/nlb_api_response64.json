                "\"Singapore is known for its remarkable economic success while its strict laws on freedom of speech, drugs, vandalism, homosexuality and public protest have been legitimised in the name of maintaining public order, racial harmony and internal security for this success. Lee Kuan Yew's 'Asian values' are widely discussed as a key touchstone for debates on universalism and cultural relativism. Singapore's official position on human rights has very clearly established that national security and public order are prioritized over the full realisation of human rights, within Article 29 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Singapore's tough stance on human rights, however, does not negate the long and persistent existence of a human rights society that exists almost unknown to the world. The focus of this book is on independent activists and writers, documenting this tradition in Singapore society that has a legacy of defending universal values of individual human rights. It uncovers their discourses, main contentions, campaigns, survival strategies, prominent activists and their untold stories during Singapore's first 50 years of independence\"-- Provided by publisher.

The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, known as the \"equality amendment,\" was passed in the years after the Civil War to help protect the rights and freedoms of Black Americans. In the centuries that followed, the amendment grew to protect the rights of women, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ people as well. But in recent years, the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment has shifted dramatically. A series of landmark Supreme Court cases\u2014ranging from abortion to affirmative action\u2014have rolled back the amendment's guarantees and called into question its usefulness as a tool in the fight for equality. What does the future hold for the Fourteenth?  Hana Bajramovic's  Whose Right Is It? The Fourteenth Amendment and the Fight for Equality  explores how one amendment to the Constitution shaped civil rights and liberties in America and became the focus for many of today's most important political debates. Featuring historical photos and informative graphics, this book shows a new generation of activists what the fight for equality across race, sexuality, gender, and citizenship might look like in the years to come.

Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism, this topic-driven picture book offers clear, concrete language and compelling imagery to introduce the concept of justice. This book aims to ground the idea of justice within the responsibilities and benefits of being part of a healthy community. While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about tough issues from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. Stunning art accompanies the simple and interactive text, and the backmatter offers additional resources and ideas for extending this discussion. "

                "In another unrelenting look at the iniquities of the American justice system, Lawrence Goldstone, acclaimed author of  Unpunished Murder ,  Stolen Justice , and  Separate No More , examines the history of racism against Japanese Americans, exploring the territory of citizenship and touching on fears of non-white immigration to the US \u2014 with hauntingly contemporary echoes.   On December 7, 1941 \u2014 \"a date which will live in infamy\" \u2014 the Japanese navy launched an attack on the American military bases at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The next day, President Franklin Roosevelt declared war on Japan, and the US Army officially entered the Second World War.    Three years later, on December 18, 1944, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which enabled the Secretary of War to enforce a mass deportation of more than 100,000 Americans to what government officials themselves called \"concentration camps.\" None of these citizens had been accused of a real crime. All of them were torn from their homes, jobs, schools, and communities, and deposited in tawdry, makeshift housing behind barbed wire, solely for the crime of being of Japanese descent. President Roosevelt declared this community \"alien,\" \u2014 whether they were citizens or not, native-born or not \u2014 accusing them of being potential spies and saboteurs for Japan who deserved to have their Constitutional rights stripped away. In doing so, the president set in motion another date which would live in infamy, the day when the US joined the ranks of those Fascist nations that had forcibly deported innocents solely on the basis of the circumstance of their birth.    In 1944 the US Supreme Court ruled, in  Korematsu v. United States , that the forcible deportation and detention of Japanese Americans on the basis of race was a \"military necessity.\" Today it is widely considered one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of all time. But Korematsu was not an isolated event. In fact, the Court's racist ruling was the result of a deep-seated anti-Japanese, anti-Asian sentiment running all the way back to the California Gold Rush of the mid-1800s. Starting from this pivotal moment, Constitutional law scholar Lawrence Goldstone will take young readers through the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries leading up to the fundamental injustice of Japanese American internment. Tracing the history of Japanese immigration to America and the growing fear whites had of losing power, Goldstone will raise deeply resonant questions of what makes an American an American, and what it means for the Supreme Court to stand as the \"people's\" branch of government.

                "A Coretta Scott King Author Honor Book \"This moving picture book portrays a girl who met injustice with dignity and excelled.\"\u2014 Booklist  (starred review)    From a multi-award-winning pair comes a deeply affecting portrait of determination against discrimination: the story of young spelling champion MacNolia Cox.   MacNolia Cox was no ordinary kid.   Her idea of fun was reading the dictionary.   In 1936, eighth grader MacNolia Cox became the first African American to win the Akron, Ohio, spelling bee. And with that win, she was asked to compete at the prestigious National Spelling Bee in Washington, DC, where she and a girl from New Jersey were the first African Americans invited since its founding. She left her home state a celebrity\u2014right up there with Ohio's own Joe Louis and Jesse Owens\u2014with a military band and a crowd of thousands to see her off at the station. But celebration turned to chill when the train crossed the state line into Maryland, where segregation was the law of the land. Prejudice and discrimination ruled\u2014on the train, in the hotel, and, sadly, at the spelling bee itself. With a brief epilogue recounting MacNolia's further history,  How Do You Spell  Unfair ?  is the story of her groundbreaking achievement magnificently told by award-winning creators and frequent picture-book collaborators Carole Boston Weatherford and Frank Morrison.

                "Since the attacks of September 11th, there has been  a sweeping revision of U.S. immigration laws, foreign intelligence gathering operations, and domestic law enforcement procedures.  While aimed at countering terrorism and bringing to justice those individuals who are responsible for carrying out acts of terror against the U.S., many of these measures also involve a profound curtailment of our constitutional rights and liberties.  Among the most controversial of the new measures is the  unprecedented order authorizing the creation of special military tribunals to try non-citizens suspected of terrorism.         Declaring an \"extraordinary emergency,\" George Bush unilaterally signed the measure into existence on November 13, 2001. With a single swipe of his pen, President Bush replaced the democratic pillars of our legal system with that of a military commission system in which he, or his designee, is rule-maker, investigator, accuser, prosecutor, judge, jury, sentencing court, reviewing court, and jailer or executioner.  This system is a radical departure from the key constitutional guarantees considered to be the heart of American democracy:  the rights to a presumption of innocence, an independent judiciary, trial by jury, unanimous verdicts, public proceedings, due process, and appeals to higher courts.  All of these safeguards against injustice are gone.        \"The sadness and the sense of crisis that pervades the nation since September 11th is undeniable,\" writes Barbara Olshansky of the Center for Constitutional Rights.  \"This fact, however, does not justify even a partial repeal of the Bill of Rights, especially when such a repeal is unnecessary to protect the citizenry.\" In this Open Media Pamphlet Special Edition, Olshansky  helps us step back for a moment to assess several of the Administration's recent policy pronouncements, and examine how the Constitution addresses the cardinal issues of military authority and the requirements of due process and equal protection under the law, and how the courts and Congress have defined the proper roles of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches in our federal government.      To provide a framework for this analysis, Olshansky looks at the history of military tribunals, whether the current situation warrants the type of forum proposed by the President, the official positions that our government has taken with regard to the use of military tribunals by other nations, the legal basis for the specific form of military tribunal that is established by the Military Order, what alternatives exist to bring to justice those who may be guilty of such crimes, what constitutional principles are at stake in this decision, and what the decision to use military tribunals will mean in terms of this country's credibility and moral authority in the international arena. An urgent and timely Open Media Pamphlet Special Edition. "

                "Few modern American novelists have dared as much as William Styron in writing The Confessions of Nat Turner.  A white man and a Tidewater Virginian by birth, Styron put himself inside the life and mind of Nat Turner, the black man who led a slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831.  It is a true story told as a novel, though the author prefers to call it \"a meditation on history\" rather than a historical novel.  Many black critics scorned it when it was published, refusing to accept Styron's bold conceit, though the novel won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize in fiction and was one of the most acclaimed American novels of its time.    The Confessions of Nat Turner speaks in the first-person voice of Nat Turner himself.  Styron based the novel on details of Turner's life and a pamphlet with the same title that was presented as evidence in Turner's trial.  It is a shattering story that renders the horror of slavery -- so easily viewed as a faceless historical tragedy -- into unique human terms.  Turner had been promised freedom by his first master but it was never granted, a taste of liberty that is unbearable in its cruelty.  As a man, he can find no solace in the life that is given to him.  Turner is a powerful, compelling figure, and with visions tormenting him, he inspires a small band of slaves to rise up against their masters.  The rebellion is violent, resulting in the deaths of white men and women, but it is put down surely and bloodily, with an even higher casualty of black people.  The fate of the rebels is inevitable, and it is from this perspective that Nat Turner seeks to understand his life.    The concentrated but extravagant richness of Styron's writing, with its high rhetorical grace, is another bold choice he made in writing The Confessions of Nat Turner, at a time when writers were embracing the idea of less being more.  As in his later novel Sophie's Choice, he does not tell a story that exists only in the past.  Written in the mid-1960s, this novel addresses the horrible inequities that still existed then in the lives of African-Americans, and what those inequities do to the human equation.  \"He has begun the common history -- ours,\" the novelist James Baldwin wrote when The Confessions of Nat Turner was published.  The New York Times called it \"a triumph,\" and the Wall Street Journal wrote, \"William Styron has written the true American tragedy ... There can be no doubt, now, that he is the foremost writer of his generation.\" "

                "Throughout the years, Gloria Steinem is perhaps the single-most iconic figure associated with women's rights, her name practically synonymous with the word \"feminism.\"  Documenting everything from her boundary-pushing journalistic career to the foundation of  Ms.  magazine to being awarded the 2013 Presidential Medal of Freedom, Winifred Conkling's  Ms. Gloria Steinem: A Life  is a meticulously researched YA biography that is sure to satisfy even the most voracious of aspiring glass-ceiling smashers.  Gloria Steinem was no stranger to injustice even from a young age.  Her mother, Ruth, having suffered a nervous breakdown at only 34, spent much of Gloria's childhood in and out of mental health facilities. And when Gloria was only 10 years old, her father divorced her mother and left for California, unable to bear the stress of caring for Ruth any longer.  Gloria never blamed her mother for being unable to hold down a job to support them both after that, but rather blamed society's intrinsic hostility toward women, and working women in particular. This was the spark that lit a fire in her that would burn for decades, and continues to burn brightly today. "

Kurlansky has written Big Lies: From Socrates to social media for the next stewards of our world. It is not only a history but a how-to manual for seeing through big lies and thinking critically.    Mark Kurlansky's bestselling works of nonfiction view the history of the world through unexpected lenses, including cod, salt, and paper. In this new book for young readers his lens is the art of the big lie. Big lies are told by governments, politicians, and corporations to avoid responsibility, cast blame on the innocent, win elections, disguise intent, create chaos, and gain power and wealth. Big lies are as old as civilization. They corrupt public understanding and discourse, turn science upside down, and reinvent history. They prevent humanity from addressing critical challenges. They perpetuate injustices. They destabilize the world.    As with his book World Without Fish, Kurlansky has written A History of Big Lies for young readers, the future stewards of our world. It is not only a history but a how-to manual for seeing through big lies and thinking critically. \"I hope that you will keep asking yourself what is true as you read this book and live your life,\" he entreats readers at the outset. \"If the Age of Enlightenment is not to be followed by the Age of Chaos, we have to think for ourselves.\"   A History of Big Lies soars across history, alighting on the \"noble lies\" of Socrates and Plato, Nero blaming Christians for the burning of Rome, the great injustices of the Middle Ages, the big lies of Stalin and Hitler and their terrible consequences, and the reckless lies of contemporary demagogues, which are amplified through social media. Lies against women and Jews are two examples in the long history of \"othering\" the vulnerable for personal gain. Nor does America escape Kurlansky's equal-opportunity spotlight.    The modern age has provided ever-more-effective ways of spreading lies, but it has also given us the scientific method, which is the most effective tool for finding what is true. In the book's final chapter, Kurlansky reveals ways to deconstruct an allegation. Is there credible, testable evidence to support it? If not, suspect a lie. A scientific theory has to be testable, and so does an allegation. Who is the source? Who benefits? Is there a money trail? Especially in the age of social media, critical thinking counters lies and chaos.    \"Belief is a choice,\" Kurlansky writes, \"and honesty begins in each of us. A lack of caring what is true or false is the undoing of democracy. The alternative to truth is a corrupt state in which the loudest voices and most seductive lies confer power and wealth on grifters and oligarchs. We cannot achieve a healthy planet for all the world's people if we do not keep asking what is true.\" "

Every war, famine, and flood spits out survivors.   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) cites an unprecedented 79.5 million forcibly displaced people on the planet today. In 2018, Dina Nayeri\u2014a former refugee herself and the daughter of a refugee\u2014invited documentary photographer Anna Bosch Miralpeix to accompany her to Katsikas, a refugee camp outside Ioannina, Greece, to record the hopes and struggles of ten young Farsi-speaking refugees from Iran and Afghanistan. \"I wanted to play with them, to enter their imagined worlds, to see the landscape inside their minds,\" she says. Ranging in age from five to seventeen, the children live in partitioned shipping-crate homes crowded on a field below a mountain. Battling a dreary monster that wants to rob them of their purpose, dignity, and identity, each survives in his or her own special way.   The Waiting Place  is an unflinching look at ten young lives suspended outside of time\u2014and bravely proceeding anyway. Each lyrical passage leads the reader from one story to the next, revealing the dreams, ambitions, and personalities of each displaced child. The stories are punctuated by intimate photographs, followed by the author's reflections on life in a refugee camp. Locking the global refugee crisis sharply in focus,  The Waiting Place  is an urgent call to change what we teach young people about the nature of home and safety. "

                "A searing new work of nonfiction from a  ward-winning author Brandy Colbert   about the history and legacy of one of the most deadly and destructive acts of racial violence in American history: the Tulsa Race Massacre.   In the early morning of June 1, 1921, a white mob marched across the train tracks in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and into its predominantly Black Greenwood District\u2014a thriving, affluent neighborhood known as America's Black Wall Street. They brought with them firearms, gasoline, and explosives. In a few short hours, they'd razed thirty-five square blocks to the ground, leaving hundreds dead. The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the most devastating acts of racial violence in US history. But how did it come to pass? What exactly happened? And why are the events unknown to so many of us today?  These are the questions that award-winning author Brandy Colbert seeks to answer in this unflinching nonfiction account of the Tulsa Race Massacre. In examining the tension that was brought to a boil by many factors\u2014white resentment of Black economic and political advancement, the resurgence of white supremacist groups, the tone and perspective of the media, and more\u2014a portrait is drawn of an event singular in its devastation, but not in its kind. It is part of a legacy of white violence that can be traced from our country's earliest days through Reconstruction, the Civil Rights movement in the mid\u2013twentieth century, and the fight for justice and accountability Black Americans still face today.  The Tulsa Race Massacre has long failed to fit into the story Americans like to tell themselves about the history of their country. This book, ambitious and intimate in turn, explores the ways in which the story of the Tulsa Race Massacre is the story of America\u2014and by showing us who we are, points to a way forward. "

                "Since the revolution-turned-civil war in Syria began in 2011, over 500,000 civilians have been killed and more than 12 million Syrians have been displaced. Rania Abouzeid, one of the foremost journalists on the topic, follows two pairs of sisters from opposite sides of the conflict to give readers a firsthand glimpse of the turmoil and devastation this strife has wrought. Sunni Muslim Ruha and her younger sister Alaa withstand constant attacks by the Syrian government in rebel-held territory. Alawite sisters Hanin and Jawa try to carry on as normal in the police state of regime-held Syria. The girls grow up in a world where nightly bombings are routine and shrapnel counts as toys. They bear witness to arrests, killings, demolished homes, and further atrocities most adults could not imagine. Still, war does not dampen their sense of hope. Through the stories of Ruha and Alaa and Hanin and Jawa, Abouzeid presents a clear-eyed and page-turning account of the complex conditions in Syria leading to the onset of the harrowing conflict. With Abouzeid's careful attention and remarkable reporting, she crafts an incredibly empathetic and nuanced narrative of the Syrian civil war, and the promise of progress these young people still embody.

                "On 10 May 1994, Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president, uttering the words 'let freedom reign' as part of his famous inaugural address. More than 100,000 people turned up to hear him speak. Mandela's great skill as an orator has enabled him to use the power of words as an important weapon in his fight against discrimination and injustice in the world. This collection, which marks the 20th anniversary of Mandela's release from prison in February 1990, explores how his electrifying speeches and impressive rhetoric helped bring about social and political change in South Africa, through, among other things, the dismantling of the apartheid system. Throughout his lifetime, Mandela has spoken about and written on such issues as global warming, HIV/AIDS, human rights, racism and discrimination and women's rights, and some of these are showcased in 'Let Freedom Reign'. In this book, author Henry Russell analyses the linguistic features, content and context of Mandela's speeches, revealing the oratory skill behind this great man's most inspiring words. "

Each story is unique, yet common themes emerge &#8211; these are ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
