                "Mumbled voices in an empty attic, heavy footsteps on the stairs when all in the house are asleep, darting shadows across a darkened room . . .  It should come as no surprise that with the dawn of the digital age, people have turned their new technology toward the mysterious stories they've heard or events they've personally experienced. Here, in the dusky gloom where traditional science has refused to enter, a new breed of investigator has introduced us to the strange sounds and weird images from these nocturnal adventures. Like most people, Jeff Cole has always been intrigued by aspects of the paranormal\u2014does the human spirit endure after the body dies, and are there such things as ghosts? Though the deeper questions are best left to priests and scholars, his investigations of well- and lesser-known historical sites indicate the existence of a truly inexplicable phenomenon.  Ghostly Encounters  chronicles Cole's journey into the world of ghost hunting, other ghost hunting groups he has met, and the team he ultimately joins.  Ghostly Encounters  also provides a first-person account of the haunted locations explored, historical background and context to these sites, and audio and video clips so the reader can experience some of the startling evidence captured during these investigations.

                "For readers of  Caste ,  Sapiens , and  The Dawn of Everything , a page-turning deep-dive into how bias is learned\u2014plus a strikingly original and highly effective set of tools to  un -learn it.   Imagine a world without bias. A world where all human beings can truly be just as they are and unleash their full potential. Take a moment to imagine how you feel in such a world\u2014not what you think about it, or whether you believe it's possible, but how you  feel . This is the proposition that opens  Breaking Bias . It\u2019s your invitation to embark on a journey that will radically change your experience and show you how you, in turn, can help reshape our world. Drawing on two decades of original research and experience training thousands of students, Anu Gupta, a lawyer, scientist, and educator whose work focuses on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, has written a comprehensive and compellingly readable guide for anyone who wants to understand and unlearn conscious and unconscious biases. Whether you're a teacher or student, engineer or creative, parent or grandparent, this book will train you to become more aware of and transform bias in your daily life and within you\u2014especially beliefs and perceptions you may hold about yourself and others. Blending ancient Buddhist wisdom with modern scientific evidence, Anu takes us on a deep-time journey to explore human identities and identity-based biases and to recognize that breaking bias is the key to unlocking multiple crises in our world\u2014from racism, sexism, classism, and other -isms to burnout, loneliness, and climate change. Then he offers his signature PRISM toolkit\u2014a science-backed, somatically informed set of contemplative tools\u2014to help us dismantle learned bias within ourselves and in the world around us, moment by moment, with probing questions and writing prompts throughout the book that invite us to put these tools to use right from the start.   Breaking Bias  is one of the few books that go beyond examining the history of bias to offer actual training in how to  reduce  bias, and it\u2019s the only one written by an author with Anu's unique intersectional identities: a gay brown immigrant with Buddhist, Christian, and Hindu roots who is also an American lawyer and scholar of bias with lived experiences that span the globe. This is a book with the potential to transform the way we think and the way we live. "

But he demanded that the pilots stay on-board, refuel, and fly him to Mexico City. Just thirty minutes after the plane took off, the man jumped out of the aircraft and parachuted away...never to be seen or heard from again. Did he escape with the money?

Birthplace of the Dodgers, Sweet'n Low, and Season 21 of \"The Real World.\" With more than 400 years under its belt, the borough is filled with a history of both sweet and savory moments.        It's hard to imagine Brooklyn as anything other than a concrete jungle. Who would guess that that first battle of the Revolutionary War was fought here? Or that the world's oldest subway is hidden beneath the streets of Boerum Hill? Or how an airplane fell from the sky and landed in the middle of the street in Park Slope? Hundreds of people pass by the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument in Fort Greene Park everyday. Virtually no one stops to read the plaque. If they did, they would learn that it is actually a grave, holding up to 15,000 bodies.  Author Allison Huntington Chase, Brooklyn's own Madame Morbid, takes readers on a journey beyond the brownstones, to discover the hidden, macabre and bizarre throughout Brooklyn history. "

                "How do you maximize your success and impact as a leader while maintaining your stamina and sanity? The answer doesn't lie in simple \"efficiency.\" It's not about making better use of your time and resources. It's about understanding how energy works and how to tap into its power.   Many people live lives of intense, and false, emotional compartmentalization. For example, they strive to be one person in the corner office (invincible warrior) and another person at the dinner table (sensitive spouse), and they struggle to keep those two lives from bleeding into and contradicting each other. But as it turns out, this takes a tremendous amount of energy and is almost always impossible. One person can't be two different people.  So how do you live an integrated life of fulfillment, purpose, and success? How do you create an alignment between head, heart, and the creative power that is in coherence with your true self? The answer is both simple and complex: You need to move from managing your time to mastering your energy.  For more than a decade and a half, Ricardo Sunderland has worked with the leaders of some of the largest and most recognizable companies in the world. He has learned firsthand that for today's leaders\u2014at all levels in their organizations\u2014mental and physical energy are no longer all you need for success. Today's leaders must bring emotional and spiritual energy to their roles and create a space in which both they and their team members feel safe to challenge each other, grow together, and thrive.  Given this major leadership challenge, leaders must gain the energy advantage.  You will learn:  What gives you energy.  How to identify the energy blockers that are holding you back.  That every situation presents a choice for you to unlock the transformational source of energy within you.  The path to gaining the energy advantage on seven distinct levels. "

                "From NFL player Steve Gleason, a powerful, inspiring memoir of love, heartbreak, resilience, family, and remarkable triumph in the face of ALS \"Gleason is a symbol of resilience, hope and optimism.\u201d\u00a0\u2014 The New York Times\u00a0\u2022 \" Steve Gleason has changed the world.\" \u2013Roger Goodell, NFL Commissioner \u2022 \"An extraordinary book... A Life Impossible  will change the way people cope, think, and live.\" \u2013Mike Lupica, co-author with James Patterson of  12 Months to Live   In 2011, three years after leaving the NFL, Steve Gleason was diagnosed with ALS,\u00a0a terminal disease that takes away the ability to move, talk, and breathe. Doctors gave him three years to live. He was\u00a0thirty-three years old. As Steve says, he is now ten years past his expiration date. His memoir is the chronicle of a remarkable life, one filled with optimism and joy, despite the trauma and pain and despair he has experienced. Writing using eye-tracking technology, Gleason covers his pre-ALS life through the highs and lows of his NFL career with the New Orleans Saints, where he made one of the most memorable plays in Saints history, leading to a victory in the first post-Katrina home game,\u00a0uplifting the city, making him a hero, and reflected in a nine-foot bronze statue outside the Superdome. Then came his heartbreaking diagnosis. Gleason lost all muscle function,\u00a0he now uses Stephen Hawking-like technology to communicate, and breathes with the help of a ventilator. This book captures Gleason and his wife Michel\u2019s unmatched resilience as they reinvent their lives, refuse to succumb to despair, and face his disease realistically and existentially. This unsparing portrait argues that a person's true strength does not reside solely in one\u2019s body but also in the ability to face\u00a0unfathomable adversity\u00a0and still be able to love and treasure life.

                "When it comes to historical mysteries, Texas offers numerous long-perplexing conundrums for readers. Several of the Lone Star State's enduring legends are associated with historical figures including Davy Crockett, Billy the Kid, John Wilkes Booth, the outlaws Sam Bass and Bill Longley, and the pirate Jean Lafitte. Lost mines and buried treasures are also a long-standing part of Texas history and lore, and the location of several of these riches has baffled searches for well over a century. Searches for these elusive treasures, represented by gold and silver ingots and coins, have ranged from Texas's mountain ranges to the prairies to the coast, and continue to this day. Texas may also have been the site of several \"lost civilizations. Growing evidence suggests that Mayans, a culture long associated with southern Mexican and Central America, may have established settlements in the state after having disappeared from their homeland. The Caddo Mounds spread out over a large section of southeast Texas represent what amounted of a city that was once inhabited by thousands of natives. The questions of where they came from and what became of them continue to intrigue researchers. In Unsolved Mysteries of Texas, author and professional treasure hunter W.C. Jameson will cover these and many other mysterious happenings in the Lone Star State. "

'Mind blowingly brilliant' PHILIPPA PERRY For years as an award-winning war reporter, Sebastian Junger travelled to many front lines and frequently put his life at risk. And yet the closest he ever came to death was the summer of 2020 while spending a quiet afternoon at the New England home he shared with his wife and two young children. Crippled by abdominal pain, Junger was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. Once there, he began slipping away. As blackness encroached, he was visited by his dead father, inviting Junger to join him. \"It's okay,\" his father said. \"There's nothing to be scared of. I'll take care of you.\" That was the last thing Junger remembered until he came to the next day when he was told he had suffered a ruptured aneurysm that he should not have survived. This experience spurred Junger\u2014a confirmed atheist raised by his physicist father to respect the empirical\u2014to undertake a scientific, philosophical, and deeply personal examination of mortality and what happens after we die. How do we begin to process the brutal fact that any of us might perish unexpectedly on what begins as an ordinary day? How do we grapple with phenomena that science may be unable to explain? And what happens to a person, emotionally and spiritually, when we are forced to reckon with such existential questions? In My Time of Dying is part medical drama, part searing autobiography, and part rational inquiry into the ultimate unknowable mystery. 'Stunning ... A powerful book that comes as close as anything I've read in explaining what it means to be human' JAMES PATTERSON 'An instant classic that filled me with wonder, gratitude and awe' WILL SCHWALBE 'A stunning account I didn't so much read as inhale, awed and riveted and forever changed' MICHAEL FINKEL 'Riveting and resonant' Publishers Weekly.

                "Conspirituality   \u00a0takes a deep dive into the troubling phenomenon of influencers who have curdled New Age spirituality and wellness with the politics of paranoia\u2014peddling vaccine misinformation, tales of child trafficking, and wild conspiracy theories.   \u00a0  In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, a disturbing social media trend emerged: a large number of yoga instructors and alt-health influencers were posting stories about a secretive global cabal bent on controlling the world\u2019s population with a genocidal vaccine. Instagram feeds that had been serving up green smoothie recipes and Mary Oliver poems became firehoses of Fox News links, memes from 4chan, and prophecies of global transformation.  Since May 2020, Derek Beres, Matthew Remski and Julian Walker have used their\u00a0 Conspirituality \u00a0podcast to expose countless facets of the intersection of alt-health practitioners with far-right conspiracy trolls. Now this expansive and revelatory book\u00a0unpacks the follies, frauds, cons and cults that dominate the New Age and wellness spheres and betray the trust of people who seek genuine relief in this uncertain age.  With analytical rigor and irreverent humor,\u00a0 Conspirituality \u00a0offers\u00a0an antidote to our times, helping readers recognize wellness grifts, engage with loved ones who've fallen under the influence, and counter lies and distortions with insight and empathy.

After taking his vows to become a B\u00f6n monk and completing a pilgrimage around 22,000-foot Mount Kailash, the holiest mountain in Tibet, Tenzin Namdak envisions a life of quiet contemplation at Menri, B\u00f6n's mother monastery. Instead, he finds himself fleeing for his life across the highest and most difficult terrain on the planet.  After Tenzin's escape party is ambushed and he is severely wounded, Tenzin is taken to a concentration camp, where he overcomes his nearly fatal wound before making an arduous escape from Tibet over the daunting Himalayas.  The other two monks, lifelong friends Samten Karmay and Sangye Tenzin, witness Tibet's capital explode in a violent insurrection against Chinese rule. Escaping to Nepal, they worry about the survival of the B\u00f6n religion and begin collecting scattered works of B\u00f6n scripture. A chance meeting with British scholar David Snellgrove brings the three monks together and dramatically changes their lives. Tenzin founds a B\u00f6n settlement in exile in India, Sangye is chosen as the thirty-third Menri Trizen, B\u00f6n's highest office, and together the three monks help rebuild the nearly extinct B\u00f6n religion. Aside from the escape of the Dalai Lama, no other escape from Tibet has been so consequential for so many. "

                "A thoughtful guide to supporting both doctors and patients on their shared road to better mental and physical health.     Dr. Shanda Blackmon is a pioneer in thoracic surgery, a skilled professional dedicated to providing the highest quality of care. But as a young doctor early in her career, she was overwhelmed. Her team was working at full capacity and Dr. Blackmon struggled to meet the needs of her many patients. It was strictly a numbers game. A game she was losing.    Then one day at the clinic she noticed patients trading stories in the waiting room, sharing not just valuable advice, but empathy and encouragement. That was the genesis of the support group, a safe place where people dealing with cancer and its aftermath could talk openly about what they were going through. It was a lightbulb experience for Dr. Blackmon, and it was just the beginning. Once she saw the difference a committed ally could make in a patient's long-term survivorship, Dr. Blackmon sought to extend the principles of support to her colleagues.    Physicians, surgeons, and other healthcare workers endure long hours under constant stress and can succumb to burnout due to the tidal wave of administrative work, patient complications, and constant pressure from administration to meet impossible demands. The sad truth is, one doctor commits suicide every day in the United States, the highest suicide rate of any profession. Understanding and allyship can make a big difference in their lives, too.    The Support Group  shares stories of the patients Dr. Blackmon has treated over the years, as well as the healthcare professionals she has worked with. With insight and compassion, Dr. Blackmon takes a candid look at the role of support in our healthcare practices and offers a workable model for patients, caregivers, and providers alike. "

That gift of presence is the palpable experience of awareness that appears when we remember to be mindful of those moments.\u00a0 \u00a0     In 20 short chapters, Cochran encourages us to see presence as a living force\u2014and to recognize and explore how that shows up in our lives.

Looking at each part of the Great Pyramid, from the internal chambers to its massive stone blocks to the pyramidion on top, Dunn reveals how the pyramids in Egypt served to stimulate the release and collection of electrons in the Earth's crust by harmonizing seismic energy while also attenuating the accumulating stresses. Drawing on exhaustive ongoing research by NASA scientists into the phenomenon known as \"earthquake lights,\" Dunn shows how the pyramid builders were inspired by this phenomenon and learned to stress igneous rocks in order to harvest the resulting electron flow. He looks in depth at recent research that supports the pyramid energy theory, including new explorations of the shafts of the Queen's Chamber and analysis of the scorch marks on the ceiling of the Grand Gallery, which supports the King's Chamber explosion hypothesis. He examines the stunning significance of the large void above the Grand Gallery discovered in 2017. Dunn also analyses the results of extensive acoustic testing and measurements at ancient sacred sites and shows how the pyramids were tuned to the Earth's frequency.  While the pyramids' sophisticated energy-harvesting abilities are now in disarray and disuse, some remnants of their technologies are still there, waiting to be rediscovered and provide our civilization with an abundance of nonpolluting power.

                "Free Yourself from Stress with Simple, No-Nonsense Advice from a Zen Monk!  Zen monk Jikisai Minami takes the things we are supposed to strive for and turns them on their head. The 35 short, thought-provoking essays in this book are divided into four chapters about our sense of self, our hopes and dreams, our personal relationships and how to face death. Each essay begins with a deliberately controversial point of view to help us look at life's problems through fresh eyes.   Each chapter features a number of short, thought-provoking essays providing fresh perspectives on familiar problems that can change your life! The essays include :  People Can Live Without Dreams and Hopes  You Don't Have to Be \"Who You Want to Be\"  When Your Head Is Full of Anger, Do Routine Work  Do Things for Yourself, Not for Others  It's Natural for Life to Be Negative  If It's Not a Life or Death Problem, You Can Handle It  People Can Be Saved Just by Speaking Their True Feelings  Wanting Things Creates Anxiety  If You Grieve as Much as You Want To, the Time Will Come When You Can Laugh  A Person with Good Relationships Passes Away Beautifully   Although the author's messages may seem harsh at first, his teachings help us reduce anxiety in our daily lives. Being bound by the belief that \"I have to do X\" or \"I need to achieve Y\" causes immense stress. The author encourages us to accept our reality and live our lives from that starting point. This, he believes will free us from anxiety, relationship problems and negative emotions.  This book has been a huge hit in Japan, with reader comments such as:   \"I realized that I had made my life difficult by thinking,  I always have to be ambitious about my work .\" (Female, age 50)  \"I was deeply moved by the idea that  you don't have to find the meaning of life . This is a book I cherish.\" (Male, age 34) "

                "\u201cRoss shows us that meditation doesn\u2019t have to mean sitting still. You can turn within to find inspiration and guidance, even when you are dancing.\u201d\u2014Misty Copeland, principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre,  New York Times  bestselling author   Lead Instructor of Yoga and Meditation for Peloton Ross Rayburn offers a new and accessible take on mindfulness and the art of meditation through the practice of introversion, which is a method of self-exploration for finding authenticity, joy, and calm in our hectic, extroverted world.\u200b As  New York Times  bestselling author Robin Arzon says,  \u201cTurning Inward provides the tools to befriend yourself. In sharing his mindfulness TIPs, Ross provides a path for even the most novice meditator. Herein lies many entry points back to oneself.\u201d    Building off his popular Peloton meditation and yoga classes and his years of teaching and spiritual study, Ross Rayburn offers a new way to look at meditation. Rather than a purely esoteric practice, meditation is, Ross argues, simply \u201cturning in,\u201d which anyone can learn how to do through the practice of introversion. Billy Porter, award-winning actor, singer, director, composer, and playwright, commented,  \u201cRoss Rayburn is one of those rare people who understands how to help us access our inner depths. I\u2019m proud to call him both my teacher and my friend.\u201d   Because we spend most of our time \u201cturned outward\u201d in order to function in society, introversion offers both a respite and a source of insight. The practice of introversion leads to a happier, calmer life and a truer sense of yourself and your path\u2014something many crave in our chaotic and often polarized world.\u00a0  With the easy and enjoyable techniques in this book, and a surprisingly simple and straightforward way of thinking and seeing, you can begin introverting with more intention and with more structure and regularity, for even greater benefits. You\u2019ll learn how to handle life\u2019s difficulties with less anxiety and greater perspective, and you\u2019ll have the tools to remember who you really are, especially during those times it\u2019s easiest to forget.  \u00a0  Through these practical exercises, guided visualizations, opportunities for contemplation, breathing techniques, and more, you will discover that everything you need to be is already who you are. It\u2019s inside you. All you have to do is turn inward to find it. "

                "A Fabulous Fable of the Supernatural Kind    The saga of the Morristown ghost has been told around campfires and dinner tables in Morris County for generations. Local legend claimed British Loyalists secretly buried stolen Patriot treasure on Schooley Mountain as they fled the oncoming forces of George Washington during the Revolutionary War. Years later in 1788, a former school teacher from Connecticut, Ransford Rodgers, convinced local prominent Morristown families that a ghost was protecting the true location of the treasure and he alone could exercise it. Little did the victims know, Rodgers was perpetuating an elaborate hoax and eventually extorted large sums of money from the embarrassed local elite. The tale has been recounted in various sensational pamphlets and publications ever since, leaving behind a mystery of what is true or myth.  Author Peter Zablocki separates fact from fiction in the story of the great Morristown ghost hoax. "

Silence is habitually overlooked\u2014after all, throughout our lives, it has to compete with the cacophony of the outside world and our near-constant interior dialogue that judges, analyzes, compares, and questions. But, if we can get past this barrage, there lies a quiet place that\u2019s well worth discovering.

We all strive to find flow, when our skills, expertise, and mindset are aligned and we can perform, unimpeded, at the highest level. George Mumford calls this being \"unlocked\"\u2014a state anyone can achieve at any time. A psychologist trained in the field of mindfulness and personal development expert, Mumford has decades of experience helping a wide range of individuals\u2014from CEOs and NBA superstars to the chronically underrepresented, those experiencing homeless and fighting addiction\u2014contend with the challenges and opportunities inherent in life. Now, in this life-changing guide, he shares his wisdom with all of us, no matter our background or socioeconomic status, brilliantly guiding us on a path to discovering and harnessing our own individual potential.  \"People have called me the 'performance whisperer,'\" Mumford writes. \"I coax and tease. I 'whisper' to the stubborn, oppositional part of us that resists growth, that refuses to break old habits. To unlock the greatness within, we have to crack that shell to access what's underneath. It can be a difficult, painful process, much the way performance-training stretches our body and the limits of our endurance. The mental training, I do with athletes, prisoners, teachers, college administrators, businesspeople and others has a similar aspect. It shakes us out of the familiar and puts us in touch with deeper aspects of ourselves.\"  Chock full of tangible insights, unexpected ancient wisdom, and inspiring stories from his clients and his own life\u2014from his darkest moments of addiction and inner turmoil to training some of the best athletes in the world\u2014Unlocked is the culmination of Mumford's life's work; it helps us discover our gifts. To sustain success no matter the game or the stakes. To step into the power within us and embrace the freedom of being unlocked. "

                "Silence isn't just the absence of noise. It's a presence that brings us energy, clarity, and deeper connection.   Justin Zorn and Leigh Marz take us on an unlikely journey\u2014from the West Wing of the White House to San Quentin's death row; from Ivy League brain research laboratories to underground psychedelic circles; from the temperate rainforests of Olympic National Park to the main stage at a heavy metal festival\u2014to explore the meaning of silence and the art of finding it in any situation.  Golden reveals how to go beyond the ordinary rules and tools of mindfulness. It's a field guide for navigating the noise of the modern world\u2014not just the noise in our ears but also on our screens and in our heads. Drawing on lessons from neuroscience, business, spirituality, politics, and the arts, Marz and Zorn explore why auditory, informational, and internal silence is essential for physical health, mental clarity, ecological sustainability, and vibrant community.  With vital lessons for individuals, families, workplaces, and whole societies, Golden is an engaging and unexpected rethinking of the meaning of quiet. Marz and Zorn make the bold and convincing argument that we can repair our world by reclaiming the presence of silence in our lives. "

                "Millions-selling author and creator of Joy School Lisa McCourt outlines her unique formula for sustainable happiness, offering a year's worth of activities, prompts, and techniques that raise your \"joy setpoint\" so you can cultivate authentic, lasting peace and fulfillment in your daily life.   Unprecedented global events have left many of us feeling depleted, depressed, isolated, and disconnected from many of the things that made us happy. Lisa McCourt, host of the  Do Joy!  podcast and founder of Joy School, helps people raise their joy setpoints regardless of what is happening around them.    Learning about joy is one thing, but it's the  doing  that actually shifts your energy. McCourt offers a unique approach to joy and emotional wellness, outlining a year-long adventure in happiness that can be started on any day of the year. Joy is not an elusive fantasy to be chased; it is simply a skill to be learned, practiced, and mastered. McCourt takes readers, month by month, through the life-altering principles of vibration elevation that she has taught for 20 years through her Joy School.    Each of the 12 \"keys\" to experiencing sustainable, authentic joy builds sequentially upon the previous one to create a progressive shifting of the reader's inner landscape to one of joy and ease. As the inner landscape transforms, transformation of the external reality inevitably follows. McCourt offers weekly \"homeplay\" for the reader to take into their daily experience which, when followed, upgrade their thought patterns and default reactions into beneficial new habits of thought and behavior.    Upon completion of the final key, the reader is invited along the \"spiral,\" cycling through the keys again from their newly elevated joy setpoint. Our journey toward ever greater realms of joy and personal freedom is never concluded; we can spiral through the steps, year after year, always recalibrating our lives to ever more fulfilling levels.

As author Daniel Duke\u2014the great-great-grandson of Jesse James\u2014reveals, Jesse James and other infamous outlaws were part of a larger organization, centuries old, that has affected U.S. history from the small, rural streets of early America to the highest levels of the nation's government, with continuing influence to this day. Drawing on his great-great-grandfather's secret diaries, Duke unravels the hidden history of the Wild West to expose the outlaws, politicians, and secret societies who were pulling strings behind the scenes. He examines Jesse James's close ties with other notorious outlaws, such as Johnny Ringo, Jesse Evans, and Billy the Kid, and demonstrates not only how Jesse James faked his own death and lived out his life under an alias, but how Billy the Kid did the same. He also details how both Jesse James and Billy the Kid continued their work for the nameless organization after their faked deaths.  Exploring how Jesse James was related, by blood or marriage, to powerful people in law enforcement and politics, Duke details Jesse's connections to the Baylor family, who founded Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and other elite families who were instrumental in founding and leading the Copperheads and the Knights of the Golden Circle organizations before, during, and after the Civil War. The author shows how Jesse James was connected to former U.S. presidents Lyndon Baines Johnson and Harry S. Truman as well as President Johnson's man in the shadows, Texas mob figure Billie Sol Estes.  Exposing the secret agenda behind the outlaw gangs of the Wild West, Duke also reveals the stealthy war between the secret organization and its opposition that has been waged in the shadows for centuries.

                "Joining forces with two leading scientists,  New York Times  bestselling author Deepak Chopra offers a quantum leap for improving our physical and mental health.   In an unprecedented collaboration between three of today\u2019s most powerful minds, Deepak Chopra, M.D., teams up with physicist Jack Tuszynski, Ph.D., and endocrinologist Brian Fertig, M.D., to bring readers a visionary work that delves into the innovative world of quantum science and shows how unlocking its secrets can revolutionize how we live and age\u2014and, ultimately, how we can eradicate disease. The key is the quantum body.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Unlike our physical body, which is subject to aging, injury, and decay, the quantum body exists on a sub-atomic level and is the infinite, invisible source of everyday reality that affects your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and biological responses. Without your quantum body, there is no physical body. And this lack of awareness of the most crucial part of ourselves negatively impacts our lives every day.\u00a0 Through a powerful combination of prescriptive exercises and innovative research into the quantum world, the authors   unveil seven breakthroughs that will revolutionize the future of everyone\u2019s well-being. Central to this revolution is a groundbreaking understanding of metabolism\u2014the way our cells process energy\u2014that promises to challenge our understanding of modern medicine as we know it. Though all too familiar in the physical world, Alzheimer\u2019s, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and heart disease  do not exist  at\u00a0the fundamental level of quantum reality. By harnessing the power of the quantum body, we can significantly improve our physical and mental well-being, including supporting healthy cell, tissue, and organ function, boosting immunity, promoting mental resilience, and expanding our understanding of what it means to live a happy and purposeful life. In this groundbreaking book, Chopra, Tuszynski, and Fertig show you the way by unveiling the \u201creal\u201d reality of your body and mind as never before and providing a vision for a tomorrow that is already here.

Yet, what may hold you back in life even more are your survival patterns. Have you ever wondered why you make yourself invisible, procrastinate, or please others to get their approval? Our subconscious employs survival patterns like these to protect us from rejection, failure, and hurt. However, living in subconscious \"survival mode\" has significant downsides: when we live \"just to survive,\" we become disconnected from our true selves and our innate ability to live an empowered life of purpose, fulfillment, and self-reliant confidence.  In this step-by-step guide, Friedemann Schaub, M.D., Ph.D., explores how to break free from the six most common survival patterns\u2014the victim, invisibility, the procrastinator, the chameleon, the helper, and the lover\u2014by engaging the part of the mind that created them in the first place: the subconscious. Providing research-backed insights and brain- rewiring methods based on his 20 years' experience, Dr. Friedemann details how, through activating the healing power of the subconscious, you can throw off the shackles of these self-sabotaging patterns and \"flip\" them into the six keys to self-empowerment, allowing you to take self-reliant ownership of your life. Revealing how to work with the subconscious mind and become the leader of your life, the author details how to free yourself from living in survival mode, learn to love and accept yourself, and make authenticity and confidence your everyday way of being.

Before Marcum was a sought after celebrity yoga teacher, she was someone who thought she couldn't do yoga because she couldn't be still. Now after sixteen years of teaching yoga, she works with network executives, global brands, Hollywood actresses, and everyone in between.  Yoga is the yoke of body, mind, and spirit, and in  Close to Om , Marcum offers a guide to teach all three aspects of yoga showcasing Marcum's signature unique style, this program combines the teaching of poses with the exploration of yoga philosophy and insight into meditation and mindfulness.   By the end of  Close to Om , readers will not only know a lot about yoga and its poses, but they'll also know more about themselves: who they are, what they want, and how to get there\u2014on and off their mat. The progression in  Close to Om  is the architecture of every yoga practice\u2014and will show readers that how they do their yoga is how they do their life. "

                "The memoir of a Catholic nun\u2019s spiritual journey that explores the deep connections between faith and the natural world   Growing up in the Midwest, Judy Grathwohl never felt she belonged. \u201cI belong out west,\u201d she remembers telling her father. After joining the Sisters of St. Francis in the early 1960s and becoming Sister Marya, she came to realize that she craved a life beyond the traditional path of a Catholic nun. \u201cSomething other than dedicating my life to God was summoning me, some other life purpose,\u201d she writes.  It took several years and several detours, but when Sister Marya eventually was assigned by her order to the Northwest, she felt an immediate connection to the place and to its Native people, the Crow and Northern Cheyenne. Little by little, she was invited to become part of their communities, to share their customs and rituals, and eventually was adopted into one of their families. She came to understand that the blending of Catholic teachings and Native traditions helped build within her a deeper respect for the Earth\u2014this wheel of rocks\u2014that she could not have built on her own.\u00a0  In this intimate, revelatory memoir, Sister Marya recounts her own spiritual journey, her settling in Montana, how she\u2014a Catholic nun from Ohio\u2014came to be embraced by the Crow and Northern Cheyenne, and how their traditions prompted in her an expanding devotion to the land, its resources, and its connections to faith and God.  Honest and eye-opening, funny and heartfelt,  This Wheel of Rocks  shows how living a spiritual life committed to preserving nature and community can be both fulfilling and productive. "

                "Since you desire so earnestly that I should communicate to you the method by which I arrived at that habitual sense of God's Presence, which Our Lord, of His mercy, has been pleased to vouchsafe to me, I must tell you, that it is with great difficulty that I am prevailed on by your importunities, and now I do it only upon the terms, that you show my letter to nobody. If I knew that you would let it be seen, all the desire that I have for your perfection would not be able to determine me to it.   The account I can give you is this. Having found in many books different methods prescribed of going to God, and divers practices of the spiritual life, I thought that this would serve rather to puzzle me, than to facilitate what I sought after, which was nothing else, but how to become wholly God's. This made me resolve to give the all for the all: so after having given myself wholly to God, to make all the satisfaction I could for my sins, I renounced, for the love of Him, everything that was not His; and I began to live, as if there was none but He and I in the world. Sometimes I considered myself before Him, as a poor criminal at the feet of his judge; at other times, I beheld Him in my heart as my Father, as my God; I worshipped Him the oftenest that I could, keeping my mind in His Holy Presence, and recalling it as often as I found it wandering from Him. I found no small trouble in this exercise, and yet I continued it, notwithstanding all the difficulties that I encountered, without troubling or disquieting myself when my mind had wandered involuntarily. I made this my business, as much all the day long as at the appointed times of prayer; for at all times, every hour, every minute, even in the height of my business, I drove away from my mind everything that was capable of interrupting my thought of God.   Such has been my common practice ever since I entered into religion; and though I have done it very imperfectly, yet I have found great advantages by it. These, I well know, are to be imputed solely to the mercy and goodness of God, because we can do nothing without Him; and I still less than any. But when we are faithful to keep ourselves in His Holy Presence, and set Him always before us; this not only hinders our offending Him, and doing anything that may displease Him, at least wilfully, but it also begets in us a holy freedom, and, if I may so speak, a familiarity with God, wherewith we ask, and that successfully, the graces we stand in need of. In fine, by often repeating these acts, they become habitual, and the Presence of God is rendered as it were natural to us. Give Him thanks, if you please, with me for His great goodness towards me, which I can never sufficiently marvel at, for the many favours He has done to so miserable a sinner as I am. May all things praise him. Amen.\u2014I am, in Our Lord, Yours. "

In his books he discussed the common-sense principles and virtues that make for a well-rounded, successful life. His first book, Pushing to the Front (1894), became an instant best-seller. Marden later published fifty or more books and booklets, averaging two titles per year.

                "A modern guide to the transformative practice of silent illumination from Chan Buddhist teacher Rebecca Li.  Silent illumination, a way of penetrating the mind through curious inquiry, is an especially potent, accessible, and portable meditation practice perfectly suited for a time when there is so much fear, upheaval, and sorrow in our world. It is a method of reconnecting with our true nature, which encompasses all that exists and where suffering cannot touch us. The practice of silent illumination is simple, allowing each moment to be experienced as it is in order to manifest our innate wisdom and natural capacity for compassion. It can be integrated into all aspects of daily life and is meaningful for secular and Buddhist audiences, new and seasoned meditators alike.     After guiding readers through the history and practice of silent illumination, Rebecca Li shows us how we can recognize and unlearn our \u201cmodes of operation\u201d\u2014habits of mind that get in the way of being fully present and engaged with life. Cultivating clarity on the empty nature of these habits offers us a way to unlearn and free ourselves from unhelpful modes such as harshness to self, perfectionism, quietism, striving for spiritual attainment, and more.  Illumination  offers stories and real-life examples, references to classic Buddhist texts, and insights from Chan Master Sheng Yen to guide readers as they practice silent illumination not just on their cushions, but throughout their lives.

In this guide, meditation teacher and dog trainer Jesse Sternberg reveals the principles of the secret language of the animal kingdom and offers commonsense yet unique solutions to everyday canine behavioral problems.

Combining mindfulness teachings with animal psychology, Jesse suggests training exercises and powerful meditative practices to do with your pet as well as on your own to help build a calm and peaceful mindset for both your dog and yourself, so eventually you will find yourselves aligned and able to gracefully master even unexpected situations.  Enlightened Dog Training  offers unique training techniques for soothing anxiety, healing neuroses, overcoming aggression issues, and transforming tension into harmony. Communicate nonverbally with your dog using the signals dogs use with each other and address problems with leash training and guarding resources and territory.

Terminal lucidity is a relatively common but poorly understood phenomenon. Near the end of life, many people \u2014 including those who have suffered brain injuries or strokes, or have been silenced by mental illness or deep dementia \u2014 experience what seems a miraculous return. They regain their clarity and energy, are able to talk with families and caregivers, recall their lives, and often appear to be aware of their nearing death.   In this remarkable book, cognitive scientist and director of the Viktor Frankl Institute Dr Alexander Batthy\u00e1ny offers the first major account of terminal lucidity, utilising hundreds of case studies and his research in the related field of near-death studies to explore the mind, the body, the nature of consciousness, and what the living can learn from those who are crossing the border from life to death.   Astonishing, authoritative, and deeply moving, Threshold opens a doorway into one of life's \u2014 and death's \u2014 most provocative mysteries. "

                "Hauntings are believed to be created from violence and bloodshed. And from the beginning, the Prairie State was a place where death thrived, and mysteries became commonplace. Illinois was the home of ancient peoples know as Moundbuilders whose only legacy is silent graves and many unsolved mysteries.    The French left behind their own ghostly stories after their displacement by the Americans in the 1700s and countless slaughters such as the Dearborn Massacre gave birth to tales of horror that live on in the history of Illinois. Eerie occurrences, spooky events, unsolved mysteries, and terrifying specters haunt Illinois. Tales of headless horsemen, haunted castles and a penitentiary occupied by ghosts chill the spines of visitors. Haunted Illinois explores the Prairie State's paranormal side and serves as a guide to its haunted places. "

                "The world around us is filled with storytelling. From work to relationships to the stories we tell ourselves, we engage in many narratives that have measured effects on our thoughts, behaviour and identities, consciously and unconsciously. While storytelling has been a potent and ancient tool with the power to persuade, connect, motivate and heal, it is often reserved for those seen as influential in society.  But the truth is, we all possess the innate ability to craft, harness and share our stories, irrespective of our status. Once we open our awareness to the central concept of storytelling and understand that our unique voice holds weight, we gain the ability to control the narratives in our lives and manifest those we desire.     This is where the 5-Step Guide to Storytelling Power comes in:  Making space for your narratives: Understanding your story archetype, conditioned narratives, and insight gained from existing chapters.  Knowing who you (truly) are: Reconnecting to your true identity through exploring and claiming your sense of self.  Crafting a strong story core: Setting intentions that resonate with you and your purpose.  Effectively expressing: Mastering messaging, delivery method, vulnerability and the pitch.  Avoiding storyteller pitfalls: Overcoming self-limiting beliefs, comparison, imposter syndrome and story silencing.  Each step concludes with a summary of real-life examples filtered through three categories: Business, Relationships and Self. Unlike other business storytelling books, the  5 Steps to Storytelling Power  cuts through the typical jargon to deliver a refreshing and relatable guide for everyday storytellers to step into their power.   Your Story Is Your Power. "

In this book, Tricia Hersey, aka The Nap Bishop, encourages us to connect to the liberating power of rest, daydreaming, and naps as a foundation for healing and justice.   What would it be like to live in a well-rested world? Far too many of us have claimed productivity as the cornerstone of success. Brainwashed by capitalism, we subject our bodies and minds to work at an unrealistic, damaging, and machine\u2011level pace \u2013\u2013 feeding into the same engine that enslaved millions into brutal labor for its own relentless benefit.  In\u00a0 Rest Is Resistance , Tricia Hersey, aka the Nap Bishop, casts an illuminating light on our troubled relationship with rest and how to imagine and dream our way to a future where rest is exalted. Our worth does not reside in how much we produce, especially not for a system that exploits and dehumanizes us. Rest, in its simplest form, becomes an act of resistance and a reclaiming of power because it asserts our most basic humanity. We are enough. The systems cannot have us.  Rest Is Resistance \u00a0is rooted in spiritual energy and centered in Black liberation, womanism, somatics, and Afrofuturism. With captivating storytelling and practical advice, all delivered in Hersey\u2019s lyrical voice and informed by her deep experience in theology, activism, and performance art,\u00a0 Rest Is Resistance \u00a0is a call to action, a battle cry, a field guide, and a manifesto for all of us who are sleep deprived, searching for justice, and longing to be liberated from the oppressive grip of Grind Culture.

                "An electrifying introduction to complexity theory, the science of how complex systems behave, that explains the interconnectedness of all things and that Deepak Chopra says, \"will change the way you understand yourself and the universe.\"   Nothing in the universe is more complex than life. Throughout the skies, in oceans, and across lands, life is endlessly on the move. In its myriad forms\u2014from cells to human beings, social structures, and ecosystems\u2014life is open-ended, evolving, unpredictable, yet adaptive and self-sustaining. Complexity theory addresses the mysteries that animate science, philosophy, and metaphysics: how this teeming array of existence, from the infinitesimal to the infinite, is in fact a seamless living whole and what our place, as conscious beings, is within it. Physician, scientist, and philosopher Neil Theise makes accessible this \"theory of being,\" one of the pillars of modern science, and its holistic view of human existence. He notes the surprising underlying connections within a universe that is itself one vast complex system\u2014between ant colonies and the growth of forests, cancer and economic bubbles, murmurations of starlings and crowds walking down the street.  The implications of complexity theory are profound, providing insight into everything from the permeable boundaries of our bodies to the nature of consciousness.  Notes on Complexity  is an invitation to trade our limited, individualistic view for the expansive perspective of a universe that is dynamic, cohesive, and alive\u2014a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Theise takes us to the exhilarating frontiers of human knowledge and in the process restores wonder and meaning to our experience of the everyday. "

Jos\u00e9 Silva Jr. provides commentary throughout the book to help put the work into perspective. He made sure the course material is exactly the way his father wanted it. Not many people throughout history can claim to have started with so little, come so far, and achieved so much. Jos\u00e9 Silva had lost his parents by the time he was 6 and went to work instead of going to school. He began to study psychology \u2013 the study of human behavior \u2013 when he was 30 years old, and soon expanded his research to include the brain and mind. The mind did not reveal its secrets to him easily. He persisted, investing his own time and money, continuing even though critics scorned him.  Today he is recognized as the leading researcher in the world in the field of the mind and human potential.  And Jos\u00e9 Silva's UltraMind ESP System is leading humanity into the beginning of the second phase of human evolution on the planet.  His ultimate achievement was developing a reliable technique to use your ESP to obtain guidance and support from higher intelligence to develop creative solutions for vexing problems. "

                "Intelligence's Creative Multiplicity addresses one of our time's most essential insights if we are to think with the sophistication our future demands. Intelligence has multiple aspects each of which is critical to understanding ourselves and to addressing the important questions before us as a species.      From the book's back cover: \"We take appropriate pride in our rationality, but other aspects of our cognitive complexity-the imaginal, the emotional, the intelligence of the body-play equally important roles in our unique toolmaking, meaning-making natures. Creative Systems Theory brings particular attention to the role of intelligence's multiplicity in what makes us human. And it argues that a greater appreciation for intelligence's multiple aspects will become more and more critical in times ahead. The theory describes how a more conscious and encompassing relationship to the whole of intelligence is key to the more nuanced and mature-we could say simply wise-kind of decision-making that will be increasingly necessary in all parts of our lives. Intelligence's Creative Multiplicity offers a deep-dive look into this rich and dynamic new picture of cognition's workings.\" "

Daydream Believer  is Mitch's ultra-statement: this landmark of practical spirituality repairs the gaps in mind-power philosophy and provides a usable, persuasive, and intellectually rigorous vision of why  thoughts are causative.     In  Daydream Believer , Mitch upends outmoded spiritual concepts and tells the hard-won truth: you experience psychical lives among infinite realms; your mind is an extraphysical and reality-selecting force; and your metaphysical powers are more freely available than you may realize.  Daydream Believer  explores:    The causal power of a  wish alone .    How to tap the energies of thought during periods of grief, depression, or anxiety.  Why prayer and deific petitioning work.  How acknowledgement of suffering is a  metaphysical force .  The outer reaches\u2014and limits\u2014of mind power.  What the ablest critics of mind metaphysics get right and wrong.   Unimpeachable scientific evidence of the extra-physicality of thought.      \"My hope,\" Mitch writes, \"is that  Daydream Believer  takes the last 150 years of experimentation in New Thought to its sharpest peak and sets us on a path for the next stage...

S\u00e9ances were wildly popular in France between 1850 and 1930, when members of the general public and scholars alike turned to the wondrous as a means of understanding and explaining the world. Sofie Lachapelle explores how five distinct groups attempted to use and legitimize s\u00e9ances: spiritists, who tried to create a new \"science\" concerned with the spiritual realm and the afterlife; occultists, who hoped to connect ancient revelations with contemporary science; physicians, psychiatrists, and psychologists, who developed a pathology of supernatural experiences; psychical researchers, who drew on the unexplained experiences of the public to create a new field of research; and metapsychists, who attempted to develop a new science of yet-to-be understood natural forces.

Remembered in Celtic legends as Tu-lay, and referred to by geologists as Doggerland or Fairland, this civilization began at least as early as 4000 BCE but was ultimately destroyed by rising sea levels, huge tsunamis, and a terrible viral epidemic released from melting permafrost during a cataclysmic period of global warming.  Exploring the latest archaeological findings and recent scientific analysis of Doggerland's underwater remains, Graham Phillips shows that this ancient culture had sophisticated technology and advanced medical knowledge. He looks at evidence detected with remote sensing and seismic profiling of many artificial structures, complex settlements, gigantic earthworks, epic monoliths, and huge stone circles dated to more than 5,500 years ago preserved beneath the ground and on the ocean floor. He also looks at the small part of the Fairland landmass that still exists: Fair Isle, a tiny island some 45 miles north of the Orkney Islands of Scotland. Phillips shows how, when Fairland sank beneath the waves around 3100 BCE, its last survivors traveled by boat to settle in the British Isles, where they established the megalithic culture that built Stonehenge.  Revealing the vast archaeological evidence in support of the existence of Doggerland, as well as its threads of influence in early cultures around the world, Phillips also shows how the fate of this sophisticated ancient culture is a warning from history: the cataclysmic events that happened to the first civilizations could happen again as the world heats up.

                "From narrowly surviving World War II through enduring the profound rigors of traditional Zen training, Tangen Harada\u2019s fascinating life story and teachings present a classic picture of the Buddhist journey from suffering to realization.  On August 15, 1945, at the age of twenty, Tangen Harada stood on an airfield and prepared to board the airplane on which he would undertake a suicide mission for his country. Only the voice of Emperor Hirohito on the radio\u2014never before heard by the Japanese public\u2014announcing Japan\u2019s surrender saved his life. After returning from a Soviet POW camp in 1946, overcome with questions about the meaning of human life and\u00a0suffering, Harada sought out the counsel of a Zen master. He thus embarked on the path of awakening and liberation to which he would commit the rest of his life, eventually teaching thousands of people from around the world.\u00a0\u00a0  Throw Yourself into the House of Buddha  includes Tangen Roshi\u2019s life story in his own words, as well as twenty-four teachings conveying the heart of his Zen understanding. Each chapter, paired with a beautiful calligraphy by the master, conveys his direct,\u00a0uncompromising, yet encouraging message about the possibility of Zen realization.\u00a0 \u201cWake up,\u201d writes Harada, \u201cand you can say for yourself, \u2018The sun is my eye, the wind my breath, all of space my heart, the mountain and ocean my body. The sun shining brightly, vividly, is the eye of my life. The vastness of the sky is my heart.\u2019 Who is the master of this boundless heart? No one else but you. This is your reality. Heaven and earth\u2014same root, all things\u2014one body.\u201d. "

Your Positive Mindset Playbook  is designed to help readers create the life they desire, which begins with what they feed their minds on a daily basis. After writing over 50,000 affirmations of his own, Robert \"Sully\" Sullivan compiled his top 100, with an application story behind each one. This playbook is for individuals who seek to invest in their future, rather than waiting for their goals to become a reality.  An experienced business and military leader, Sully Sullivan knows how reading, writing, and reflection can deepen an individual's understanding of self and their personal goals and hurdles. He has seen firsthand how a daily practice of examining affirmations and applying them to his life has dramatically improved his mental health and clarity of focus.   Sullivan encourages readers to directly engage with the ideas in  Your Positive Mindset Playbook . He first directs readers to rewrite the affirmation, which deepens comprehension of the subject and strengthens their memory of it. Then he instructs readers to write what that affirmation means to them personally, which pushes them to connect the ideas to where they are each day. Sullivan hopes that the words within  Your Positive Mindset Playbook  fill readers' minds with uplifting thoughts and encouragement that can be easily applied throughout each day. "

                "Discover your unique blueprint to build a business and life you love.   Human Design is nine different modalities built into one system to catapult entrepreneurs and their businesses forward by giving them the insight they need to understand themselves, their clients and how they are designed to operate in the world.   Entrepreneurs are exhausted from the trial and error of the one-size-fits all advice for building a business, which doesn't take into consideration who they are as a person, their unique strengths, and how they authentically want to show up in support of their clients. This ultimately leaves entrepreneurs feeling overwhelmed, overworked, and battling the dreaded burnout. Many secretly want to burn it all to the ground and start over again.   Human Design For Business  shows how to understand one's personality, decision making style, energy & body management, as well as how best to process information, how best to interact with others, and how to cultivate an aligned and joyful personalized business ecosystem.    Ditch the soul-sucking \"shoulds\" of traditional business advice and take a journey into the depths of yourself to understand what makes you unique, so you can learn, leverage and live life in alignment with who you are meant to be.
