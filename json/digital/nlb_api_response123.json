The problem is due to the lack of cross-country studies, which provide a fair understanding of the different levels of development, as well as the wide variety of development strategies adopted by different countries. The relatively ineffective implementation of environmental assessment has not done much to reduce the damage to, or depletion of, the natural resource base.\". ",

Yet for a host of reasons--longer hours at work, the Internet, suburban sprawl--many have argued that friendship is on the decline in contemporary America. In social surveys, researchers have found that Americans on average have fewer friends today than in times past. In Friend v. Friend, Ethan J. Leib takes stock of this most ancient of social institutions and its ongoing transformations, and contends that it could benefit. "

The selected papers included in this book combine robust analytical pieces and theoretical insights with best practices from around the world. Specific case studies include New Orleans in the context of a fragile environment, a framework to include poverty aspects in the cities and climate change discussion, a contribution to measure the impact of cities and their GHG emissions. Cities and Climate Change is the first title in the World Bank's new Urban Development Series. The Series discusses the challenge of urbanization and what it will mean for developing countries in the decades ahead, and aims to delve more substantively into the core issues framed by the World Bank's 2009 Urban Strategy, Systems of Cities: Harnessing Urbanization for Growth and Poverty Alleviation.

Colombia, one of South Americas oldest, middle-income democracies, has developed rapidly despite a fifty year \"simmering\" civil war and increasing levels of urban and rural crime and violence. In the past decade, however, the scale and intensity of violence has changed from a marginal conflict to generalized violence that now dominates the daily lives of most citizens. As remote guerilla activity has turned into country-wide \"war,\" bringing in paramilitary groups, drug cartels, and other social actors, so too the causes of violence have changed. These have included both external events such as the collapse of the Cold War, as well as internal changes relating to economic liberalization, coal and oil developments and the impact of the global trade in illicit narcotics. Violence in Colombia is highly complex not only because of the different categories, but also due to its multiple causes. This paper combines disparate existing theories to develop an integrated framework that identifies four different levels of causality: structural, institutional, interpersonal, and individual. It recognizes the mutually reinforcing role played by factors at different levels of causality. Underlying the causes of violence in Colombia is minimal state presence in many parts of the country, widespread corruption and impunity, high levels of societal acceptance of violence, and a regionally fragmented country.

This book offers a fresh look at sustainable consumption, presenting a holistic New Economics approach. It explores how grassroots community actions for sustainability are experimenting with new ways of working, measuring value and progress, and expressing ecological citizenship. Local organic food systems, low-impact eco-housing, and complementary currencies are examined to measure their success at delivering localized economies and inclusive communities, enabling people to reduce their ecological footprints, harnessing collective energies and building new forms of social organization. Viewing these activities as innovative \u2081green niches\u2082, the book explores the opportunities for grassroots innovations to spread and influence wider society, and the barriers preventing them achieving their potential.

Unconformities are gaps in the geological record, physical evidence of breaks in time. For Hugh Raffles, these holes in history are also fissures in feeling, knowledge, memory, and understanding. In this endlessly inventive, riveting book, Raffles enters these gaps, drawing together threads of geology, history, literature, philosophy, and ethnography to trace the intimate connections between personal loss and world historical events, and to reveal the force of absence at the core of contemporary life. Through deeply researched explorations of Neolithic stone circles, Icelandic lava, mica from a Nazi concentration camp, petrified whale blubber in Svalbard, the marble prized by Manhattan's Lenape, and a huge Greenlandic meteorite that arrived in New York City along with six Inuit adventurers in 1897, Raffles shows how unconformities unceasingly incite human imagination and investigation yet refuse to conform, heal, or disappear. A journey across eons and continents,  The Book of Unconformities  is also a journey through stone: this most solid, ancient, and enigmatic of materials, it turns out, is as lively, capricious, willful, and indifferent as time itself.

                "A FRESH, FUNNY, UP-CLOSE LOOK AT HOW SOUTH KOREA REMADE ITSELF AS THE WORLD'S POP CULTURE POWERHOUSE OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY  By now, everyone in the world knows the song \"Gangnam Style\" and Psy, an instantly recognizable star. But the song's international popularity is no passing fad. \"Gangnam Style\" is only one tool in South Korea's extraordinarily elaborate and effective strategy to become a major world superpower by first becoming the world's number one pop culture exporter. As a child, Euny Hong moved from America to the Gangnam neighbourhood in Seoul. She was a witness to the most accelerated part of South Korea's economic development, during which time it leapfrogged from third-world military dictatorship to first-world liberal democracy on the cutting edge of global technology. Euny Hong recounts how South Korea vaulted itself into the twenty-first century, becoming a global leader in business, technology, education, and pop culture. Featuring lively, in-depth reporting and numerous interviews with Koreans working in all areas of government and society,  The Birth of Korean Cool  reveals how a really uncool country became cool, and how a nation that once banned miniskirts, long hair on men, and rock 'n' roll could come to mass produce boy bands, soap operas, and the world's most important smart phone.

Throughout the late 1800s, they toiled in the grape fields, mines, hop farms, leather tanneries and laundries, and carved out neighborhoods in towns throughout the Valley. These contributions did little to deter discrimination and Anti-Chinese Leagues sprang up to harass and intimidate immigrants like Chan Wah Jack, who ran the successful Sang Lung store in Napa's Chinatown. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act hastened the decline of local Chinatowns and these once vibrant communities disappeared while the industries they helped to foster flourished. Join author John McCormick as he uncovers the forgotten contributions of the Chinese people in California's most famous wine region. "

Such terms are not usually associated with women in the 1920s, as women returning docilely to the domestic cage at the end of the First World War has become part of the accepted narrative. Like many war and immediate post war myths, it does contain some truth, but the story of women between 1918 and 1928 is much more complex, often more positive and certainly far more interesting than previously suggested. Changing Roles looks at some of the women who forged new identities for themselves while exploring how their own or their loved ones' wartime experiences influenced the roles they stepped into, sometimes reluctantly, frequently enthusiastically, often successfully. It explores how women fought back against the misogynistic climate of the 1920s, used the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act to achieve their goals, played their part as full citizens and how the legacy of their global endeavours, achievements and occasional failures is still with us today, spreading far beyond our shores. By telling the stories of both ordinary and extraordinary women whose actions disturbed the status quo, shook the Establishment to its core, and sent shock-waves across the Atlantic, this book presents a cast of fascinating characters ranging from crowned heads to girl gangs, business women to philanthropists, inviting readers to exclaim, \"Gosh, I never knew that!\" "

Over a lifetime spent at the frontline of solidarity and resistance, Arundhati Roy's words have lit a clear way through the darkness that surrounds us. Combining the skills of the architect she trained to be and the writer she became, she illuminates the hidden structures of modern empire like no one else, revealing their workings so that we can resist. Her subjects: war, nationalism, fundamentalism and rising fascism, turbocharged by neoliberalism and now technology. But also: truth, justice, freedom, resistance, solidarity and above all imagination \u2013 in particular the imagination to see what is in front of us, to envision another way, and to fight for it. Arundhati Roy's voice \u2013 as distinct and compelling in conversation as in her writing \u2013 explores these themes and more in this essential collection of interviews with David Barsamian, conducted over two decades, from 2001 to the present.

                "The ideas of who belongs and who does not, who is an insider and who is an outsider have sparked severe friction in Northeast India for decades now. From the frequent characterization of Bengal-origin Muslims in Assam as illegal Bangladeshi immigrants to the ethnic battles between the Meiteis and Kuki-Zo tribals of Manipur, from the Naga and Mizo separatist insurgencies to the prejudice the tribal minorities face in the mainland\u2014negotiating identity has always been a complex issue. In recent years the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship Amendment Act have added to that complexity.  Amidst sweeping political and social changes in the Northeast and the rest of the country, have things changed for the 'Northeasterner'?

                "The incredible story of MOVE, the revolutionary Black civil liberties group that Philadelphia police bombed in 1985, killing 11 civilians\u2014by one of the few people born into the organization, raised during the bombing's tumultuous aftermath, and entrusted with repairing what was left of his family.    \"As necessary and powerful as it is captivating.\" \u2013   Michael Harriot, New York Times bestselling author of Black AF History    \"Searing and urgent.\" \u2013 Bakari Sellers, New York Times bestselling author of My Vanishing Country and The Moment   Before police dropped a bomb on a residential neighborhood on May 13, 1985, few people outside Philadelphia were aware that a Black-led civil liberties organization had taken root there. Founded in 1972 by a charismatic ideologue called John Africa, MOVE's mission was to protect all forms of life from systemic oppression. They drew their ideology from the Black Panther Party and pre-dated animal and environmental rights groups like PETA and Earth First. MOVE emerged in an era when Black Philadelphians suffered under devastating policies brought by the long, doomed war in Vietnam, Mayor Frank Rizzo's overtly racist police surveillance, and, eventually, President Ronald Reagan's War on Drugs. MOVE members lived together in a collection of West Philadelphia row houses and took the surname Africa out of admiration for the group's founder.  But in MOVE's lifestyle, city officials saw threats to their status quo. Their bombing of MOVE homes shocked the nation and made international news. Eleven people were killed, including five children. And the City of Brotherly Love became known as the City That Bombed Itself.  Among the children most affected by the bombing was Mike Africa Jr. Born in jail following a police attack on MOVE that led to his parents' decades-long incarcerations, Mike was six years old and living with his grandmother when MOVE was bombed. In the ensuing years, Mike sought purpose in the ashes left behind. He began learning about the law as a teenager and became adept at speaking and inspiring public support with the help of other MOVE members. In 2018, at age 40, he finally succeeded in getting his parents released from prison.  On a Move is one of the most unimaginable stories of injustice and resilience in recent American history. But it is not only one of tragedy. It is about coming-of-age for a young activist, the strong ties of family, and, against all odds, learning how to take indignities on the chin and to work within the very system that created them. At once a harrowing personal account and an impassioned examination of racism and police violence, On a Move testifies to the power of love and hope, in the face of astonishing wrongdoing. "

By bringing these perspectives together in one book, readers gain a sense of the complex scientific, social, and ideological contexts within which AI and robotics research is unfolding, as well as the illusory suppositions and distorted claims being mobilized by the industry in the name of bettering humanity's future. Discussions about AI and robotics have been shaped by computer science and engineering, steered by corporate and military interests, forged by transhumanist philosophy and libertarian politics, animated by fiction, and hyped by the media. From fiction passing as science to the illusion of AI autonomy to the business of ethics to the automation of war, this collection recognizes the inevitable entanglement of humanity and technology, while exposing theproblematic assumptions and myths driving the field in order to better assess its risks and potential.

They may not even know they are dying, victims of the kindly lie that there is still hope. They are unlikely to see even their family doctor in their final hours, robbed of their dignity and fed through a tube after a long series of excessive and hopeless medical interventions.  This is the starting point of Seamus O'Mahoney's thoughtful, moving and unforgettable book on the western way of death. Dying has never been more public, with celebrities writing detailed memoirs of their illness, but in private we have done our best to banish all thought of dying and made a good death increasingly difficult to achieve.

Using philosophical, bioethical, and legal analysis, the author\u00a0 engages with key scholars in pediatric decision-making and individual and religious rights theory. Going beyond the parent-child dyad, the author is deeply concerned both with the inteests of the broader society and with the appropriate limits of government interference in the private sphere. The text offers a balance of individual and population interests, maximizing liberty but safeguarding against harm. Bioethics and law professors will therefore be able to use this text for both a foundational overview as well as specific, subject-level analysis. Clinicians such as pediatricians and gynecologists, as well as policy-makers can use this text to achieve balance between these often competing claims. The book is written by a physician with practical and theoretical knowledge of the subject, and deep sympathy for the parental and family perspectives. As such, the book proposes a new way of evaluating parental and state interventions in children's' healthcare: a refreshing approach and a useful addition to the literature. "

It begins by taking the reader on a journey that outlines basic human desires\u2014in short, we are storytellers, and we need the objects of our desire to be able to mirror that aspect of our beings. This not only explains the reasons we seek out differences in our mates, but also why we crave sex and romance with robots. In creating a new species of potential companions, science fiction highlights what we already want and how our desires dictate\u2014and are in return recreated\u2014 by what is written. But sex with robots is more than a sci-fi pop-culture phenomenon; it's a driving force in the latest technological advances in cybernetic science. As such, this book looks at both what we imagine and what we can create in terms of the newest iterations of robotic companionship. "

                "What if human reproduction was always elective? A prominent bioethicist speculates about the possibilities\u2014and the likely consequences.  What would the world be like if all pregnancy was intended, not unintended as it is nearly half the time now? Considerably better, Margaret Pabst Battin suggests in  Sex and the Planet , a provocative thought experiment with far-reaching real-world implications. Many of the world\u2019s most vexing and seemingly intractable issues begin with sex\u2014when sperm meets egg, as Battin puts it\u2014abortion, adolescent pregnancy, high-risk pregnancy, sexual violence, population growth and decline. Rethinking reproductive rights and exposing our many mistaken assumptions about sex,  Sex and the Planet  offers an optimistic picture of how we might solve these problems\u2014by drastically curtailing unintended pregnancies using currently available methods. How we see this picture\u2014as recommendation, prediction, utopian fantasy, totalitarian plot, hypothetical conjecture, or realistic solution\u2014depends to a great degree on which of thirteen problematic assumptions we maintain, assumptions Battin works to identify and challenge. Taking on sensitive topics like abortion and rape and religious issues around contraception, she shows how a fully informed, nonideological approach could defuse much of the friction such issues tend to generate. Also, in her attention to male contraception and the asymmetry of female and male reproductive control, she pulls in the 50 percent of the human race\u2014those with Y chromosomes\u2014largely left out of discussions of reproductive health.  Sex and the Planet , finally, takes a global view, inviting us to consider a possible\u2014even plausible\u2014reproductive future. "

It provides a holistic view of human history and social evolution by drawing on the latest evidence from a wide range of disciplines and proposes new hypotheses on the origins of human behaviour. After exploration of the encounters of\u00a0 Homo sapiens \u00a0with other human species, diverse aspects of life in emerging societies are examined, including clothing, work, leisure, learning, diet, disease, and the role of women. Attention is drawn to the key role of self-domestication \u2013 the process of reducing natural aggression and increasing playfulness \u2013 in enabling survival. Another focus is\u00a0 Homo oeconomicus. \u00a0The significance of symbolic thought for the emergence of surpluses in goods and services is highlighted, with analysis of how this led to private accumulation of wealth and development of the first hierarchical societies. Finally, the discussion turns to humans of the future and the potential risks posed by artificial intelligence. The aim is to unveil the deep roots of our social behaviour and how it is going to intertwine with the development of digital technologies and social networks. "

Powerful institutions, from schools to tech and social media companies, create breeding grounds for isolation by failing to invest in relational work. This obstacle stands in the way of our fight for racial equity, economic justice, and climate resilience. In   Relationality  , leading asexuality and relationship activist David Jay brings clarity to the crisis with a fresh perspective that expands upon the fundamental idea that all entities in the universe are connected. Jay draws from a range of vivid personal experiences, including his time spent helping tech workers and policymakers reform social media. This book is for people who believe in the power of relationships and want to see increased investment in relational work. Its scientifically grounded framework will help readers foster conversations about relational work, establish conditions for relationships to thrive, and quantify the impact of them. Equipping professionals and activists involved in nonprofit, political, and other types of relational work with the knowledge they need to fight for and utilize resources,   Relationality   shares valuable insight on:\u00a0  The history of why institutions fail to invest in relationships\u00a0  Reimagining ROI calculations to account for relational work  Using tools of prediction and emergence theory to build communities  How stories and data about relationships can help us direct resources toward relational work  Relational economics and the redistribution of wealth  With isolation and loneliness on the rise in a post-lockdown world,   Relationality   offers a roadmap to nourish our connections toward a better, more liberated world\u2014personally, organizationally, and in community.

                "It's time to create a future where feminine power and leadership is celebrated. It's time for a radical awakening and a revolution. It's time for women to  rise .    In  Women Rising , you'll discover how to recognise and resist the very real forces of power that limit how you work and live as a woman. Are you tired of being asked to 'lean in,' fit in, perform and conform? The truth is that women today continue to be constrained by pervasive ideas about how we 'should' act and behave.   To break free, we need to understand the forces that limit our potential. Those forces are external and internal, without and within, and they sabotage the very success we work so hard for. In  Women Rising , author and award-winning empowerment expert Megan Dalla-Camina shows you how to see and cut the invisible strings holding you back.    Women Rising  unveils the 6 external paradoxes that impact how women lead and succeed. You'll uncover how these power paradoxes affect our visibility, empowerment, confidence, success, motherhood and leadership.   Turning inward, you'll discover how our internal narratives, the stories we tell ourselves, can also serve to keep us stuck.  Women Rising  unmasks 13 archetypes that keep us striving for impossible standards as a Perfectionist, an Overachiever, a Good Girl, a People Pleaser and more.   Finally,  Women Rising  illuminates the path forward. It shares real, practical tools and strategies that women everywhere can use to craft a future where we succeed on our own terms. Grounded in leadership experience from the world's largest organisations, Megan Dalla-Camina's hands-on toolkit shows you how to find your vision and purpose \u2014 and evolve as a confident, authentic leader.   It's time to rise and to step into your power. This guide will show you how. "

                "How differences in national financial regulatory systems emerged from divergent beliefs about economic order and prosperity  The global financial crisis of the late 2000s was marked by the failure of regulators to rein in risk-taking by banks. And yet regulatory issues varied from country to country, with some national financial regulatory systems proving more effective than others. In  Visions of Financial Order , Kim Pernell traces the emergence of important national differences in financial regulation in the decades leading up to the crisis. To do so, she examines the cases of the United States, Canada, and Spain\u2014three countries that subscribed to the same transnational regulatory framework (the Basel Capital Accord) but developed different regulatory policies in areas that would directly affect bank performance during the financial crisis. In a broad historical analysis that extends from the rise of the first modern chartered banks in the 1780s through the major financial crises of the twentieth century and the Basel Capital Accord of 1988, Pernell shows how the different (and sometimes competing) principles of order embedded in each country's regulatory and political institutions gave rise to distinctive visions of order and prosperity, which shaped subsequent financial regulatory design. Pernell argues that the different worldviews of national banking regulators reflected cultural beliefs about the ideal way to organize economic life to promote order, stability, and prosperity .   Visions of Financial Order  offers an innovative perspective on the persistent differences between regulatory institutions and the ways they shaped the unfolding of the 2008 global financial crisis.

                "A timely and urgent argument for preserving the work that connects us in the age of automation  With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and labor-saving technologies like self-checkouts and automated factories, the future of work has never been more uncertain, and even jobs requiring high levels of human interaction are no longer safe.  The Last Human Job  explores the human connections that underlie our work, arguing that what people do for each other in these settings is valuable and worth preserving. Drawing on in-depth interviews and observations with people in a broad range of professions\u2014from physicians, teachers, and coaches to chaplains, therapists, caregivers, and hairdressers\u2014Allison Pugh develops the concept of \"connective labor,\" a kind of work that relies on empathy, the spontaneity of human contact, and a mutual recognition of each other's humanity. The threats to connective labor are not only those posed by advances in AI or apps; Pugh demonstrates how profit-driven campaigns imposing industrial logic shrink the time for workers to connect, enforce new priorities of data and metrics, and introduce standardized practices that hinder our ability to truly see each other. She concludes with profiles of organizations where connective labor thrives, offering practical steps for building a social architecture that works. Vividly illustrating how connective labor enriches the lives of individuals and binds our communities together,  The Last Human Job  is a compelling argument for us to recognize, value, and protect humane work in an increasingly automated and disconnected world.

Few billionaires have been in the public eye for as long, and in as many guises, as Bill Gates. At first heralded as a tech visionary, the Microsoft cofounder next morphed into a ruthless capitalist, only to change yet again when he fashioned himself into a global do-gooder. Along the way, Gates forever influenced how we think about tech founders, as the products they make and the ideas they sell continue to dominate our lives. Through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, he also set a new standard for high-profile, billionaire philanthropy. But there is more to Gates's story, and here, Das's revelatory reporting shows us that billionaires have secrets and philanthropy can have a dark side.    Drawing upon hundreds of interviews with current and former employees of the Gates Foundation, Microsoft, academics, nonprofits, and those with insight into the Gates universe, Das delves into Gates's relationships with Warren Buffett, Jeffrey Epstein, Melinda French Gates, and others, to uncover the truths behind the public persona. In telling Gates's story, Das also provides a new way to think about how billionaires wield their power, manipulate their image, and pursue philanthropy to become heroes, repair damaged reputations, and direct policy to achieve their preferred outcomes.   Insightful, illuminating, and timely,  Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King  is an important story of money and government, wealth and power, and media and image, and the ways in which the world's richest people hold us in their thrall.

                "What would happen if policing disappeared?\u00a0  Would we be safe?\u00a0  This book imagines a world without police.    It\u2019s evident that policing is a problem. But what is the best way forward? In  Beyond Policing , distinguished scholar and writer Philip V. McHarris reimagines the world without police to find answers and reveal how we can make police departments obsolete.    Beyond Policing  tackles thorny issues with evidence, including data and personal stories, to uncover the weight of policing on people and communities and the patterns that prove police reform only leads to more policing.    McHarris challenges us to envision a future where safety is not synonymous with policing but is built on the foundation of community support and preventive measures. He explores innovative community-based safety models (like community mediators and violence interrupters), the decriminalization of driving offenses, and the creation of nonpolice crisis response teams. McHarris also outlines strategies for responding to conflict and harm in ways that transform the conditions that give rise to the issues. He asks us to imagine a world where people thrive without the shadow of inequality, where our approach to safety is a collective achievement.    McHarris writes, \u201cWhat if our response to crisis wasn\u2019t about control but about care? How can we create conditions where safety is a shared responsibility? How can we design justice so that no community is routinely oppressed? Envisioning such a world isn\u2019t just a daydream; it\u2019s the first step toward building a society where violence and fear no longer dictate our lives.\u201d    Transformative and forward thinking,  Beyond Policing  provides a blueprint for a brighter, safer world. McHarris\u2019s vision is clear: we must dare to move beyond policing and foster a society where everyone has the resources to thrive and feel safe. "

                "This tour de force of investigative journalism\u2014in the vein of  The Next Civil War  and  Why We're Polarized \u2014reveals how the battle between the right and left is spilling out from the darkest corners of the internet into the real world with often tragic consequences.   Award-winning journalist and CNN correspondent Elle Reeve was not surprised by the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. With years of in-depth research and on-the-ground investigative reporting under her belt, Reeve was aware of the preoccupations of the online far right and their journey from the computer to QAnon, militias, and racist groups.   At the same time, Reeve saw a parallel growth of counterforces, with citizen vigilantes using new tools and tactics to take down the far right. This ongoing battle, long fought mainly on the internet, had arrived in the real world with greater and greater frequency.   With a sharp eye for detail and a dash of dark humor, Reeve explains the origins of this shocking sweep of political violence. Drawing on countless interviews with sources in the white nationalist movement as well as hundreds of as-yet-unseen documents, she takes us on a surreal journey from the darkest corners of the internet to the most significant and chilling scenes of real-world political violence in generations. A stranger-than-fiction odyssey into the dark heart of what American politics has become,  Black Pill  is necessary reading for any supporter of democracy. "

                "When Dorothy Pilley first set hand on the rope in the 1910s, women climbers were seen as a dangerous liability, their achievements ignored, unrecorded or disbelieved. Undeterred, Dorothy proved herself on the vertiginous slopes of Wales, Scotland and the Lake District before tackling the rock faces of the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Rockies, Mount Fuji and the Himalayas. Her tireless championing of other women climbers as well as her own trailblazing example led to women being seen as serious mountaineers with impressive records on bravery, skill and endurance. First published in 1935, Climbing Days tells a daredevil tale of adventure, near-death slips and rapturous achievement in high places, interleaved with moments highlighting the particular challenges of being a woman in a sport seen as the province of men.

Have you been calling her enough? You sure she's not spending too much time on YouTube? Is she talking fondly of dictators? Has she suddenly started quietly muttering in the Aldi queue about the \"Jewish Space Lasers\" she's heard are setting wildfires around the world to make sure everyone believes in climate change? When was the moment the world began to believe anything?  Danny Wallace, million-copy bestselling author of  Yes Man  and  Join Me , has fallen down the modern rabbit hole of lies, conspiracies and disinformation. Along the way, he encounters families torn apart by accusations and fake news, journalists putting themselves on the frontline of the disinformation war, reformed conspiracy theorists, influencers who see profit in stoking paranoia, and the shadowy nameless, faceless trolls on the other side of our screens. He discovers how disinformation and well-told lies can ruin a year or a whole life, how they can affect our family, our street, our community. How they can spread across a country, a continent, even the world. How they take hold of our imaginations and make us feel both helpless and powerful. And Danny asks: can you do anything to stop it \u2013 even with the truth on your side?. "

                "Uncertainties are everywhere. Whether it's climate change, financial volatility, pandemic outbreaks or new technologies, we don't know what the future will hold. For many contemporary challenges, navigating uncertainty \u2013 where we cannot predict what may happen \u2013 is essential and, as the book explores, this is much more than just managing risk. But how is this done, and what can we learn from different contexts about responding to and living with uncertainty? Indeed, what might it mean to live\u00a0 from \u00a0uncertainty? Drawing on experiences from across the world, the chapters in this book explore finance and banking, technology regulation, critical infrastructures, pandemics, natural disasters and climate change. Each chapter contrasts an approach centred on risk and control, where we assume we know about and can manage the future, with one that is more flexible, responding to uncertainty.\u00a0 The book argues that we need to adjust our modernist, controlling view and to develop new approaches, including some reclaimed and adapted from previous times or different cultures. This requires a radical rethinking of policies, institutions and practices for successfully navigating uncertainties in an increasingly turbulent world. "

QAnon beliefs and adjacent conspiracy theories have had devastating political consequences as they\u2019ve exploded in popularity. What\u2019s often overlooked is the lasting havoc they wreak on our society at its most basic and intimate level\u2014the family.\u00a0 In  The Quiet Damage , celebrated reporter Jesselyn Cook paints a harrowing portrait of the vulnerabilities that have left so many of us susceptible to outrageous falsehoods promising order, purpose, and control. Braided throughout are the stories of five American families: an elderly couple whose fifty-year romance takes a heartbreaking turn; millennial sisters of color who grew up in dire poverty\u2014one to become a BLM activist, the other, a hardcore conspiracy theorist pulling her little boy down the rabbit hole with her; a Bay Area hippie-type and her business-executive fianc\u00e9, who must decide whether to stay with her as she turns into a stranger before his eyes; evangelical parents whose simple life in a sleepy suburb spirals into delusion-fueled chaos; and a rural mother-son duo who, after carrying each other through unspeakable tragedy, stop speaking at all as ludicrous untruths shatter a bond long thought unbreakable. Charting the arc of each believer\u2019s path from their first intersection with conspiracy theories to the depths of their cultish conviction, to\u2014in some cases\u2014their rejection of disinformation and the mending of fractured relationships, Cook offers a rare, intimate look into the psychology of how and why ordinary people come to believe the unbelievable. Profound, brilliantly researched, and beautifully written,  The Quiet Damage  lays bare how we have been taken hostage by grifters peddling lies built on false hope\u2014and how we might release our loved ones, and ourselves, from their grasp.

What happens when the opposite of freedom is not unfreedom but death, not slavery but mortality? How are we to think of the right to life when a political demand for dignity and honor might be more important than life itself?  Dying for Freedom \u00a0explores these questions by drawing on archival evidence from South Africa to show how death and conflicting notions of sacrifice dominated the struggle for political equality in that country. This political investment in death as a marker of commitment to the anti-apartheid struggle encouraged a masculinist style of politics in which the fight for freedom was seen and understood by many activists as a struggle literally for manhood. This investment generated a notion of political sacrifice so absolute that anything less than death was rendered suspect. More importantly, it resulted in a hierarchy of death whereby some deaths were more important than others, and where some deaths could be mourned and others not. This highly original account of the necropolitics of the liberation struggle will be of interest to students and scholars throughout the humanities and social sciences and to anyone interested in South Africa.

                "\"A new history of Egyptology that prioritizes the women whose contributions, for good and otherwise, shaped the field.\" -  The New York Times  The never-before-told story of the women Egyptologists who paved the way of exploration in Egypt and created the basis for Egyptology.  The history of Egyptology is often told as yet one more grand narrative of powerful men striving to seize the day and the precious artifacts for their competing homelands. But that is only half of the story. During the so-called Golden Age of Exploration, there were women working and exploring before Howard Carter discovered the tomb of King Tut. Before men even conceived of claiming the story for themselves, women were working in Egypt to lay the groundwork for all future exploration.  In  Women in the Valley of the Kings: The Untold Story of Women Egyptologists in the Gilded Age , Kathleen Sheppard brings the untold stories of these women back into this narrative. Sheppard begins with some of the earliest European women who ventured to Egypt as travelers: Amelia Edwards, Jenny Lane, and Marianne Brocklehurst. Their travelogues, diaries and maps chronicled a new world for the curious. In the vast desert, Maggie Benson, the first woman granted permission to excavate in Egypt, met Nettie Gourlay, the woman who became her lifelong companion. They battled issues of oppression and exclusion and, ultimately, are credited with excavating the Temple of Mut.  As each woman scored a success in the desert, she set up the women who came later for their own struggles and successes. Emma Andrews' success as a patron and archaeologist helped to pave the way for Margaret Murray to teach. Margaret's work in the university led to the artists Amice Calverley's and Myrtle Broome's ability to work on site at Abydos, creating brilliant reproductions of tomb art, and to Kate Bradbury's and Caroline Ransom's leadership in critical Egyptological institutions.  Women in the Valley of the Kings  upends the grand male narrative of Egyptian exploration and shows how a group of courageous women charted unknown territory and changed the field of Egyptology forever.

                "From NYU professor of developmental psychology Niobe Way,     an in-depth exploration about what boys and young men teach us about themselves, us, and the toxic culture we have created, one in which we value money over people, toys over human connection, and academic achievement over kindness. Based on her longitudinal and mixed-method research over thirty-five years,  Rebels with a Cause  is a true call to action to change the culture so that we stop the vicious cycle of violence and blame.   \u00a0  Dr. Niobe Way has spent her career researching social and emotional development and finds that boys and young men desperately want and need the same thing as everyone else: close friendships. Yet they and we grow up in a stereotyped \u201cboy\u201d culture, one that devalues and mocks those relationships, rather than recognizing that they\u2019re necessary for human survival.  \u00a0  In  Rebels with a Cause , Way takes her message one step beyond her previous book,  Deep Secrets , which was the inspiration for an Oscar-nominated film  Close,  to reveal how these \u201crebels,\u201d as she calls the boys and young men in her research and in her classrooms, teach us about their and our crisis of connection, evidence of which is visible in our soaring rates of depression, anxiety, loneliness, suicide, and mass violence. They also teach us about the solutions to the crisis, which is to care, to listen with curiosity, and to take individual and collective responsibility for the damage we have done to them, to ourselves, and to the world around us.  \u00a0  Way provides us not only with data-driven insight into the roots and consequences of this crisis of connection, but also offers us concrete and empirically tested strategies for creating a culture that better aligns with our human nature and our human needs. Her book reminds us that \u201cit\u2019s not the rebels who cause the troubles of the world, it\u2019s the troubles that cause the rebels.\u201d The time to listen to and act on what young rebels have been telling us for almost a century is now.

                "Should we bring new humans into the world? Or would it be better off without us? A renowned philosopher and advisor to NBC\u2019s  The Good Place  offers a thoughtful exploration of humanity\u2019s future\u2014or lack thereof.  \u00a0  \u201cFor more than five years, Todd May was my philosophical advisor. I heartily recommend that he be yours as well. (It helps that he\u2019s quite funny.)\u201d\u2014Michael Schur, from the Introduction  \u00a0 These days it\u2019s harder than ever to watch TV, scroll social media, or even just sit at home looking out of the window without contemplating the question at the heart of philosopher Todd May\u2019s  Should We Go Extinct?  Facing climate destruction and the revived specter of nuclear annihilation even as humans continue to cause untold suffering to our fellow creatures on planet Earth, we are forced each day to contemplate whether the world would be better off in our absence. \u00a0 In this timely, fascinating examination, May, a renowned philosopher and advisor to the acclaimed TV show  The Good Place , reasons both for and against the continuation of our species, trying to help us understand how and whether, the positive and negative tallies of the human ledger are comparable, and what conclusions we might draw about ourselves and our future from doing so. He discusses the value that only humans can bring to the world and to one another as well as the goods, like art and music, that would be lost were we no longer here. On the other side of the ledger, he walks us through the suffering we cause to nature and the non-human world, seeking to understand whether it\u2019s possible to justify such suffering against our merits and if not, what changes we could make to reduce the harm we cause.\u00a0 \u00a0 In this moment of rising pessimism about the future, and as many people wonder whether they should bring children into such a dark and difficult world, the questions May tackles in  Should We Go Extinct?  are hardly theoretical. As he explores the complexities involved with changes such as an end to factory farming, curbing scientific testing of animals, reducing the human population, and seeking to develop empathy with our fellow creatures, May sketches a powerful framework for establishing our responsibilities as a species and gives hope that we might one day find universal agreement that the answer to his title question should be  No .

                "Hope for the future lies with a new generation of regenerative farmers.      Within a decade, nearly half of all American farmland will change hands as an older generation of farmers steps aside. In their place, a groundswell of new growers will face numerous challenges, including soil degradation, insufficient income, and investors devouring farmland at a staggering pace. These new farmers are embracing regenerative agriculture\u2014the holistic approach to growing food that restores the soil and biodiversity\u2014in the movement to reclaim our health and the planet's. But can their efforts help reverse an epidemic of diet-related disease, food inequality, and even climate change?    To answer that question and more, award-winning journalist Jennifer Grayson embedded herself in a groundbreaking farmer training program, then embarked on this investigative journey. The diverse array of farmers, graziers, and food activists whom she profiles here are working toward better, more sustainable foodways for all. From a one-acre market garden in Oregon to activists reviving food sovereignty in South Carolina, A Call to Farms tells the captivating story of these new agrarians finding hope and purpose in reconnecting to the land and striving to improve the future of American food.

                "A concise, accessible introduction to language endangerment and why it is one of the most urgent challenges of our times.   58% of the world\u2019s languages\u2014or, approximately 4,000 languages\u2014are endangered. When we break this figure down, we realize that roughly ten percent of languages have fewer than ten language keepers. And, if one language stops being used every three months, this means that in the next 100 years, if we do nothing, 400 more languages will become dormant. In  Endangered Languages , Evangelia Adamou, a specialist of endangered languages and a learner of her own community language, Nashta, offers a sobering look at language endangerment and what is truly lost when a language disappears from usage. Combining recent advances from the Western scientific tradition\u2014from the fields of linguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, language attrition, population genetics, and natural language processing\u2014and insights from Indigenous epistemology, theory, and ethics, Adamou examines a wealth of issues surrounding endangered languages. She discusses where endangered languages are found, including how they are faring in a digital world, why these languages are no longer used, and how communities can reclaim languages and keep them strong. Adamou also explains the impact of language continuity on community and individual health and well-being, the importance of language transmission in cultural transmission, and why language rights are essentially human rights. Drawing on varied examples from the Wampanoag Nation to Wales,  Endangered Languages  offers a powerful reminder of the crucial role every language has in the vitality and well-being of individuals, communities, and our world.

                "Barrett Brown went to prison for four years for leaking intelligence documents. He was released to Trump's America. This is his story.   After a series of escapades both online and off that brought him in and out of 4chan forums, the halls of power, heroin addiction, and federal prison, Barrett Brown is a free man. He was arrested for his part in an attempt to catalog, interpret, and disseminate top-secret documents exposed in a security lapse by the intelligence contractor Stratfor in 2011. An influential journalist who is also active in the hacktivist collective Anonymous, Brown recounts exploits from a life shaped by an often self-destructive drive to speak truth to power. With inimitable wit and style, palpable anger and conviction, he exposes the incompetence and injustices that plague media and politics, reflects on the successes and failures of the transparency movement, and shows the way forward in harnessing digital communication tools for collective action. But  My Glorious Defeats  is more than just the tale of the clever and hilarious Brown; it's also a rigorously researched dissection of our decaying institutions and of human nature itself. As Brown makes clear, institutions are made of people\u2014people with personal ambitions and personal vices\u2014and it is people, just like him, just like us, who hold power. As optimistic as it is heartbreaking,  My Glorious Defeats  is an entertaining and illuminating manual for insurgency in the information age. "

But hidden beneath this smooth surface lies the grim reality of a precarious global workforce of millions that labour under often appalling conditions to make AI possible. Feeding the Machine presents an urgent, riveting investigation of the intricate network of organisations that maintain this exploitative system, revealing the untold truth of AI. Based on hundreds of interviews and thousands of hours of fieldwork over more than a decade, this book shows us the lives of the workers often deliberately concealed from view and the systems of power that determine their future. It shows how AI is an extraction machine that churns through ever-larger datasets and feeds off humanity's labour and collective intelligence to power its algorithms. Feeding the Machine is a call to arms against this exploitative system and details what we need to do, individually and collectively, to fight for a more just digital future. "

For lovers of both Barbie and Gloria Steinem,  The Movement  is the first oral history of the decade that built the modern feminist movement. Through the captivating individual voices of the people who lived it,  The Movement  tells the intimate inside story of what it felt like to be at the forefront of the modern feminist crusade, when women rejected thousands of years of custom and demanded the freedom to be who they wanted and needed to be.    This engaging history traces women's awakening, organizing, and agitating between the years of 1963 and 1973, when a decentralized collection of people and events coalesced to create a spontaneous combustion. From Betty Friedan's  The Feminine Mystique , to the underground abortion network the Janes, to Shirley Chisholm's presidential campaign and Billie Jean King's 1973 battle of the sexes, Bingham artfully weaves together the fragments of that explosion person by person, bringing to life the emotions of this personal, cultural, and political revolution. Artists and politicians, athletes and lawyers, Black and white,  The Movement  brings readers into the rooms where these women insisted on being treated as first class citizens, and in the process, changed the fabric of American life.

The book is a timely master class for anyone interested in the future of learning in the AI era. No one has thought more about these issues\u2014or has more interesting things to say about them' Bill Gates   Whether we like it or not, the AI revolution is coming to education. In  Brave New Words , Salman Khan, the visionary behind Khan Academy, explores how artificial intelligence and GPT technology will transform learning, offering a roadmap for teachers, parents, and students to navigate this exciting (and sometimes intimidating) new world. A pioneer in the world of education technology, Khan explains the ins and outs of these cutting-edge tools and how they will forever change the way we learn and teach. Rather than approaching the ChatGPT revolution with white-knuckled fear, Khan wants parents and teachers to embrace AI and adapt to it (while acknowledging its imperfections and limitations). He emphasizes that embracing AI in education is not about replacing human interaction but enhancing it, so that every student can complement the work they're already doing in profoundly new and creative ways, to personalize learning, adapt assessments, and support success in the classroom, preparing students for an increasingly digital future. But  Brave New Words  is not just about technology - it's about what this technology means for our society, and the practical implications for administrators, guidance counsellors, and hiring managers who can harness the power of AI in education and the workplace. Khan also delves into the ethical and social implications of AI and GPT, offering thoughtful insights into how we can use these tools to build a more accessible education system for students around the world.

                "\"Smart, witty and packed with surprising facts about life in the Nordics, The Danish Secret to Happy Kids is a foolproof roadmap to raising kids the Viking way. If you enjoy Helen Russell's signature self-deprecating sense of humor and captivating storytelling, you're in for a real treat.\" \u2014 Linda \u00c5keson McGurk, author of There's No Such Thing as Bad Weather and The Open-Air Life    What do Vikings know about raising children? Turns out, quite a bit. \u00a0  After a decade of living in Denmark, and raising her three kids there, Helen Russell noticed that Nordic kids (or mini-Vikings) are different from children raised in other parts of the world. They eat differently. They learn differently. They play, dress, and even sleep differently. They run, jump, climb, fall and get up again, out in nature, for hours a day. It's cold and wet and uncomfortable\u2014often. But they cope. Even though the weather's terrible and it's dark October through March. And then they grow up to be some of the happiest adults on the planet. So her question was: how?  In The Danish Secret to Happy Kids, Russell dives deep into the parenting culture of Denmark and the other Nordic nations, from parental leave policies to school structure to screen time, uncovering surprising strategies and customs that lead to largely happy, well-adjusted humans over the long term. This fascinating peek behind the cultural curtain allows readers to marvel over infants comfortably sleeping outside in chilly temperatures, school-age kids wielding axes in the woods, and teenagers spending a year or two at efterskole, a special boarding school designed to prepare adolescents for independent life in the real world\u2014a concept that is beginning to be adopted in other nations.  Refreshingly funny and unfailingly optimistic about the new generation of humans growing up in the world right now, The Danish Secret to Happy Kids is a heart-warming love letter to Russell's adopted homeland, a comforting armchair travel read, and proof that we could all use a bit more Viking in our everyday lives.

Yet our romantic lives are conspicuously absent from the media and cultural conversation. Sexual education does not typically address the specific information needed by disabled students. Mainstream dating apps fail to include disability as an aspect of one\u2019s identity alongside race, ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation. The few underutilized disability-focused apps are paternalistic and unappealing. Bestselling dating books do not address disability, and the few relationship books marketed to disabled people focus on the mechanics of sex rather than the complex interactions that create the conditions for it.  In  Dateable , disabled authors Jessica Slice Caroline Cupp team up to address the serious gap in the dating space.  Dateable \u00a0is the first book on disabled dating and relationships; it\u2019s a dating guide made especially for disabled and chronically ill people, that also calls in nondisabled readers. Jessica and Caroline take on everything from rom-com representation and dating apps to sex and breakups with a strong narrative underpinning and down-to-earth advice. The book is as much a practical tool as it is an empowering guide. "

For decades we've delighted in dreaming about a sci-fi utopia, from flying cars and bionic humans to hyperloops and smart cities. And why not? Building a better world - be it a free-flying commute or an automated urban lifestyle - is a worthy dream. Given the pace of technological change, nothing seems impossible anymore. But why are these innovations always out of reach? Delving into the remarkable history of technology,  The Long History of the Future  introduces us to the clever scientists, genius engineers and eccentric innovators who first brought these ideas to life and have struggled to make them work since. These stories reveal a more realistic picture of how these technologies may evolve - and how we'll eventually get to use them. You may never be able to buy a fully driverless car, but automated braking and steering could slash collision rates. Smart cities won't perfect city life, but they could help empty bins on time. Hyperloops may never arrive, but superfast trains are already here. We always believe current technology is the best it could be. By looking to the past and the future, Nicole Kobie shows how history always proves us wrong and how what lies ahead may not be what we imagine, but so much better. "

But what should take their place?  Or:  Prisons don\u2019t keep us safe. But what new systems could?  A lot of books about racial justice ask us how we got here, but   Reimagining the Revolution   is different: award-winning journalist and activist Paula Lehman-Ewing presents an inside-access look at the activists redefining where we  go  from here. Readers will hear from:   Ivan Kilgore , an incarcerated activist who founded the 501c3 nonprofit United Black Family Scholarship Foundation from behind prison walls   Critical Resistance , one of the oldest grassroots organizations in the nation working to dismantle the prison-industrial complex  The co-founders of  Greenwood , a Black-owned financial technology institution designed specifically for Black and Latino people and businesses:  Michael Render,  aka  Killer Mike, Amb. Andrew Young and Ryan Glover   Incarcerated activist  Heshima Denham  on his grassroots efforts to build a society for Black and Brown people independent of the state\u00a0   The Movement for Black Lives, the Alliance for Safety and Justice, BYP 100 , and  8toAbolition    Incarcerated and formerly incarcerated artists  using art to heal from trauma, connect with other incarcerated people, and amplify abolitionist change  Lehman-Ewing frames each profile within two fundamental truths: The current system\u2014built and sustained by oppression, extraction, and inequity by design\u2014cannot be reformed. And, knowing this, we need abolition; we need creative solutions designed by the people most impacted by the systems they fight to change.   Reimagining the Revolution   is a call to action for each of us: if we can access the tools we have, we can dream bigger, think outside the box, and follow the paths laid out by change-making activists toward nothing short of revolution.

In  Bite , zoologist Bill Schutt makes a surprising case: it is teeth that are responsible for the long-term success of vertebrates. The appearance of teeth, roughly half a billion years ago, was an adaptation that allowed animals with backbones, such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, dinosaurs and mammals\u2014including us\u2014to chow down in pretty much every conceivable environment.  And it\u2019s not just food. Tusks and fangs have played crucial roles as defensive weapons\u2014glimpsing the upper canines of snarling dogs is all it takes to know that teeth are an efficient means of aggression. Vampire bats use their razor-sharp teeth to obtain a widespread but generally untappable resource: blood. Early humans employed their teeth as tools to soften tough fibers and animal hides. Our teeth project information and social status\u2014the ancient Etruscans were the first to wear tooth bling, and it\u2019s doubtful that George Washington would have been elected president without the false teeth he wore.  So much of what we know about life on this planet has come from the study of fossilized teeth, which have provided information not only about evolution but also about famine, war, and disease. In his signature witty style, the author of  Pump  and  Cannibalism  shows us how our continued understanding of teeth may help us humans through current and future crises, from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to mental health issues.  Bite  is popular science at its best and will appeal to readers of Mary Roach, Merlin Sheldrake, and Ed Yong. "

                "\"Nurturing and inspiring.\"\u2015 Kirkus Reviews  \"An essential book of practical wisdom.... If you're white and have been asking, 'What can I do now?' this lively and timely book is for you.\"\u2015Robert Jones, New York Times bestselling author of  The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy    Antiracism as Daily Practice  illustrates the many ways white Americans\u2014those newly waking to the crisis of racism in 2020 and those already aware\u2014can choose behaviors in our everyday lives to grow racial justice. Full of real life stories, this book shows how vital it is for white people to engage in and with our families, through our social networks, in our neighborhoods, and at our jobs to make antiracism a daily living commitment. We have real power in our relationships with other white people\u2014and not enough of us have used it. Dr. Harvey explains why we white people struggle with knowing what to do about racism, and explores the significance of emotions like grief and anger (as well as the harmful role of shame) in really reckoning with the transformation and change needed in our communities to become the partners in justice that Black communities and other communities of color need and deserve. Not only is such transformation vital to the well-being of U.S. democracy. It's vital to the freedom and wholeness of white people too. "

                "\"Entertaining, phenomenally weird\u00a0. . .  Rat City  may well be the world\u2019s first-ever work of socio-biographical-scientific pop history. . . .a freaky romp down a peculiar passage in the history of ideas, full of oddball cameos (Aldous Huxley! Buckminster Fuller!) and some very sharp science writing.\"\u2014 The New York Times  Behind the internet's viral \"Universe 25\" experiment and Robert C. O'Brien's iconic novel,  Mrs. Frisby and the Secret of NIMH,  was one scientist who set out to change the way we view our fellow man \u2014 using rats . . .  After the Civil War and throughout the twentieth century, cities in northern American states absorbed a huge increase in populations, particularly of immigrants and African Americans from southern states. City governments responded by creating new regulations that were often segregationist \u2014 corralling black Americans, for example, into small, increasingly overcrowded neighborhoods, or into high-rise \u201cprojects.\u201d The situation intensified after World War II, as rising crime and racial unrest swept the nation, and blame fell on the crowded conditions of city life. The hardest-hit populations were left marginalized and voiceless.    Enter John B. Calhoun, an ecologist employed by the National Institute of Mental Health to study the effects of overcrowding on rats. From 1947 to 1977, Calhoun built a series of sprawling habitats in which a rat\u2019s every need was met\u2014except space. The results were cataclysmic.\u00a0Did a similar fate await our own teeming cities?  Rat City  is the first book to tell the story of Calhoun\u2019s experiments, and their extraordinary influence \u2014 an enthralling record of urban design and dystopian science. Meticulously researched, it\u00a0follows Calhoun\u2019s struggle to solve the problem of crowding before America\u2019s cities drain into the behavioral sink.\u00a0And as the \u201cwar on rats\u201d continues around the world, and our post-pandemic society reevaluates the necessity of urban living, the riveting story of  Rat City  is more relevant than ever.

Millions of us use restrictive diets, intermittent fasting, IV therapies, and Ozempic abuse to shrink until we are sample-size acceptable. But for the 30 million Americans who live with eating disorders, it isn't just about less. More, Please is a chronicle of a lifelong fixation with food\u2014its power to soothe, to comfort, to offer a fleeting escape from the outside world\u2014as well as an examination of the ways in which compulsory thinness, diet culture, and the seductive promise of \"wellness\" have resulted in warping countless Americans' relationship with healthy eating.
