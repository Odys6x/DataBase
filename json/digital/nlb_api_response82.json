Aitken uncovers how the British official film, and British official information agencies, adapted to the epochal contexts of the Cold War and end of empire. In addition to an extensive introduction, which touches on a number of critical issues related to the post-war British official film, the book provides an account of how the tradition of film-making associated with the British documentary film movement spread into the region during the post-war period, and how that tradition was contested by a 'Colonial Office' tradition of film-making. The volume concludes by covering the rise of television in the region within the context of developing post-colonial authoritarian states in Singapore and Malaysia, and the continuation of colonial authoritarianism in Hong Kong.

                "Walkley Award-winning journalist Tracey Spicer exposes the next frontier of feminism.  Man-Made  aims to open readers' eyes to a transformative technological shift in society and give them the tools to make positive change.   'Mum, I want a robot slave.'  Broadcaster Tracey Spicer had an epiphany when her young son uttered these six words. Suddenly, her life's work fighting inequality seemed futile. What's the point in agitating to change the present, if bigotry is being embedded into our futures?  And so began a quest to uncover who was responsible and hold them to account. Who is the ultimate villain? Big Tech, whose titans refuse to spend money to fix the problem? The world's politicians, who lack the will to legislate? Or should we all be walking into a hall of mirrors and taking a good, hard look at ourselves...?  This is a deeply researched, illuminating and gripping ride into an uncertain future, culminating in a resounding call to action that will shake the tech sector to its foundations.  Praise for  Man-Made    'Exhilarating ... The book we need as we grapple with how AI will change our lives and our world.'  Dame Quentin Bryce   'Brilliant, hilarious and terrifying. You'll never see Alexa the same way again.'  Juanita Phillips   'Tracey Spicer uses her unmistakably human voice to warn us all about the deeply sexist Frankenstein's Monster that is modern AI.'  Yumi Stynes. "

                "In this fascinating new book, bestselling author and historian Nathaniel Lande explores the Great War at the heart of the twentieth century through the prism of theater. He presents the war as a drama that evolved and developed as it progressed, a production staged and overseen by four contrasting masters: Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, and Stalin. Each leader used all the tools at his disposal to present his own distinctive vision of the global drama that was the Second World War. Each area of the media was fully exploited. Brilliantly conceived oratory was applied to underscore each vision. Impression management, the art of political spin, was employed to drive the message home with the careful use of black and white propaganda. Each side employed uniforms, meticulously staged events, and broadcast their messages via all media available\u2014motion pictures, radio broadcasts, posters, leaflets, and beyond. Their ambitions were similar, but each leader had his own distinct methods, his own carefully created script for elaborately produced and often wildly successful acts and campaigns of deception to win hearts and minds on the frontlines and the home front. The result of this investigation is a wholly distinctive and often surprising work of history, a book that manages to cast a fresh light on the most obsessively studied conflict in human history. "

What's gone wrong with our media? The answer: its owners. From William Randolph Hearst to Elon Musk, from the British press barons to colonial upstarts Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch, media proprietors have manipulated the news to accumulate wealth and influence as they meddled with democracy.   Eric Beecher knows the news business from bottom to top. He has been a journalist, editor and media proprietor (of Text Media and  Crikey ), with the rare distinction of having both worked for and been sued (unsuccessfully) by the Murdochs.   This book reveals the distorted role of the media moguls of the past two centuries: their techniques, strategies, behind-closed-doors machinations, and indulgent lifestyles. It explains how they have exploited the shield of the freedom of the press to undermine journalism \u2013 and truth.   In an era of fake news, AI and misinformation, this is democracy's chillingly important story: how a small coterie of flawed and narcissistic moguls created a shadow of power that has contributed to making the media an agent of mistrust.

Emma and Nicole want to break down barriers and open up a deeper dialogue of the mixed-race experience. Although this book was born out of a desire to speak directly to the mixed-race community, they discovered there is something in it for everyone. Whether you are mixed, you know someone mixed, if you have ever considered dating outside of your race, if you're a parent committed to sharing a more diverse view of the world with your child, or indeed an adult wanting to expand your views on culture and identity \u2013 then The Half of It is for you.

                "From the author of  When America Stopped Being Great , an insightful and urgent reassessment of America's past, present and future \u2013 as a country which is forever at war with itself.     The Forever War  tells the story of how America's extreme polarisation is 250 years in the making, and argues that the roots of its modern-day malaise are to be found in its troubled and unresolved   past.   As we approach the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the American experiment is failing. Division, mistrust and misinformation are now the country's defining characteristics. The storming of the Capitol, the prosecution of Donald Trump and battles over gun rights and abortion raise the spectre of further political violence, and even the possibility of a second civil war.   Nick Bryant explains how the hate, divisiveness and paranoia we see today are in fact a core part of America's story. Combining brilliant storytelling, historical research and first-hand reportage, Bryant argues that insurrections, massacres and civil disturbances should sadly not be seen as abnormalities; they are a part of the fabric of the history of America.   The compromises originally designed to hold the union together have never truly been resolved and today, a country that once looked so confidently to the future has become captive to its contentious past.

                "Since the US presidential election of 2016 the words propaganda and fake news have been prominent in American political and cultural discourse. Yet very few people can provide a coherent explanation of what they mean, precisely, when using them. On the two sides of the political spectrum (\"red\" and \"blue\"), each points out messages from the other side that they think are untrue\u2014or that they simply don't like. Unlike our dangerously biased political system, however, reality has more than only two sides. For decades, Americans sat by while their mediated world was carved into a single \"red reality\" focused in necessary opposition to a single \"blue reality.\" We've been given \"red media outlets\" and \"blue media outlets\" to stoke our collective rage, each against the other's lies. But the first two decades of the twenty-first century have presented us with a new information environment, one of unregulated and seemingly uncontrollable information. Like the young boy in a popular folktale, we can now see\u2014if only we can resist the pressures of social conformity\u2014that both emperors, red and blue, strut proudly before us, naked. Propaganda 2.1 is a handbook for seeing reality clearly\u2014and coping with it. "

In doing do, the book argues that\u00a0crowdsourced participation has become normalised and institutionalised into the everyday repertoires of citizens and their organisations.\u00a0Within the digitally-enabled shift in individual acts of participation, creating, signing and sharing online petitions and micro-donations have become a focal point because of the clear evolution from their offline and online counterparts. To illustrate their arguments the authors\u00a0use an original nationally representative survey on acts of political engagement, undertaken with Australian citizens. Additionally, through\u00a0detailed interviews and analysis of their web presence they show how advocacy organisations use online petitions within their repertoire of strategic actions. Lastly, they\u00a0analyse the kinds of policy issues that mobilise citizens on crowdsourcing platforms, based on a unique dataset of 17,000 petitions from the popular non-government platform, Change.org. They contrast these mass public concerns with the policy agenda of the government of the day to show there is a disjuncture and general lack of responsiveness to this form of citizen expression. "

TLS From one of our leading experts on disinformation, the incredible true story of the complex and largely forgotten WWII propagandist Sefton Delmer - and what we can learn from him today. In the summer of 1941, Hitler and his allies ruled Europe from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. Britain was struggling to combat the powerful Nazi propaganda machine, which crowed victory and smeared its enemies. However, inside Germany, there was one notable voice of dissent from the very heart of the military machine - Der Chef, a German whose radio broadcasts skilfully questioned Nazi doctrine. He had access to high-ranking military secrets and spoke of internal rebellion. His listeners included German soldiers and citizens. But what these audiences didn't know was that Der Chef was a fiction, a character created by the British propagandist Sefton Delmer, just one player in his vast counter-propaganda cabaret, a unique weapon in the war. As author Peter Pomerantsev uncovers Delmer's story, he is called into a wartime propaganda effort of his own: the global response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This book is the story of Delmer and his modern-day investigator, as they each embark on their own quest to seduce and inspire the passions of supporters and enemies, and to turn the tide of information wars.

Several of the essays describe the process of constructing a digital archive as a specific case study \u2013 in digitising a physical archive and designing a searchable digital database as the core of the digital archive. Other chapters explore the cultural significance of digital archives in more general theoretical terms. These considerations include: the specific properties of the digital archive; its similarities and differences to the traditional paper-based archive; the ethical decisions made in the design of an archive; and the potential for creative re-use of online archived materials.

Holder Jr, 82nd Attorney General of the United States  American society is more polarized than ever before. We are strategically being pushed apart by disinformation\u2014the deliberate spreading of lies disguised as truth\u2014and it comes at us from all sides: opportunists on the far right, Russian misinformed social media influencers, among others. It's endangering our democracy and causing havoc in our electoral system, schools, hospitals, workplaces, and in our Capitol. Advances in technology including rapid developments in artificial intelligence threaten to make the problems even worse by amplifying false claims and manufacturing credibility. In  Attack from Within , legal scholar and analyst Barbara McQuade, shows us how to identify the ways disinformation is seeping into all facets of our society and how we can fight against it. The book includes:   The  authoritarian playbook : a brief history of disinformation from Mussolini and Hitler to Bolsonaro and Trump, chronicles the ways in which authoritarians have used disinformation to seize and retain power.   Disinformation tactics \u2014like demonizing the other, seducing with nostalgia, silencing critics, muzzling the media, condemning the courts; stoking violence\u2014and reasons why they work.  An explanation of  why America is particularly vulnerable to disinformation  and how it\u00a0exploits our First Amendment Freedoms, sparks\u00a0threats and violence, and destabilizes social structures.   Real, accessible solutions for countering disinformation  and maintaining the rule of law such as making domestic terrorism a federal crime, increasing media literacy in schools, criminalizing doxxing, and much more.  Disinformation is designed to evoke a strong emotional response to push us toward more extreme views, unable to find common ground with others. The false claims that led to the breathtaking attack on our Capitol in 2021 may have been only a dress rehearsal.  Attack from Within  shows us how to prevent it from happening again, thus preserving our country\u2019s hard-won democracy. "

                "Why were Hollywood producers eager to film on the other side of the Iron Curtain? How did Western computer games become popular in socialist Czechoslovakia's youth paramilitary clubs? What did Finnish commercial television hope to gain from broadcasting Soviet drama?   Cold War media cultures are typically remembered in terms of an East-West binary, emphasizing conflict and propaganda.  Remapping Cold War Media , however, offers a different perspective on the period, illuminating the extensive connections between media industries and cultures in Europe's Cold War East and their counterparts in the West and Global South. These connections were forged by pragmatic, technological, economic, political, and aesthetic forces; they had multiple, at times conflicting, functions and meanings. And they helped shape the ways in which media circulates today\u2014from film festivals, to satellite networks, to coproductions.  Considering\u00a0film, literature, radio, photography, computer games, and television,\u00a0 Remapping Cold War Media  offers a transnational history of postwar media that spans Eastern and Western Europe, the Nordic countries, Cuba, the United States, and beyond. Contributors draw on extensive archival research to reveal how media traveled across geopolitical boundaries; the processes of translation, interpretation, and reception on which these travels depended; and the significance of media form, content, industries, and infrastructures then and now.

                "The  Ministry of Truth  scrutinizes the information market in the era of the attention economy calling on citizens, public educators and politicians to action in averting the role of BigTech in critical infrastructure. Through phenomena such as influencers, 'fake news', and covid conspiracies, the authors reveal how social platforms control facts, feelings and narratives in our time to such a degree that they are the  de facto  arbiters of truth. BigTech seemingly controls the information infrastructure and also decides what we pay attention to.\u00a0  The authors suggest hope for a more democratic internet through their systematic analysis of the largest players of the information age. The aim is to amplify human agency for a robust deliberative democracy - not version 2.0 - but a lasting version with staying power. This book appeals to the general interest reader and professional invested in the mobilization of responsible technological development.   VincentF. Hendricks  is Professor of Formal Philosophy at The University of Copenhagen. He is Director of the Center for Information and Bubble Studies (CIBS) funded by the Carlsberg Foundation.   Camilla Mehlsen  is Digital Media Expert and Spokesperson for the Danish child organization Children's Welfare. She is author of several books on digital literacy and her work on digital media has been published in various newspapers and magazines. "

From performing farm animal caesarean sections at all hours to missing special occasions in order to treat much loved family pets in crisis, no two days in the work of vet Guy Gordon and his team are ever the same. Based in Thurso, northern Scotland, the small group of vets and their supporting staff cover a vast area of more than one thousand square miles. The expansive, wild and rural landscape in which they operate brings a huge variety of work depending on the season, with the delivery of newborn lambs and calves in the spring, and the arrival of seal pups to the northern Scottish coast starting in the autumn months. The Highland Vet shows what working in one of Britain's most beautiful and remote locations really involves. Inside, Guy and his team share the highs and lows, ups and downs and ins and outs of their daily work throughout the course of a year, making this a truly magical celebration of Scotland's northern Highlands, as well as the animals and people who call the region home.

But if you were only reading mainstream headlines, you probably have no idea just how bad it really was. As homes and businesses were being burned to the ground and livelihoods were being destroyed, corporate media engaged in a full-scale attempt to gaslight the American people, pushing Orwellian narratives about the violent riots by mislabeling them as peaceful, democratic demonstrations, all seemingly to bolster their biased political views.      But one intrepid reporter was on the ground at all the major riots and witnessed what really happened \u2014 and is telling the full story for the first time.     In his explosive new book, Julio Rosas presents the definitive account of what really happened that summer, exposing the truth behind countless misleading headlines and taking readers inside the shocking and heartbreaking destruction the media refused to cover. Rosas' groundbreaking reporting of the biggest and most destructive riots that gripped the nation in recent memory \u2014 including Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle, and more \u2014 decisively uproots the prevailing bogus narratives about destructive woke mobs and sheds much-needed light on the truth about what happened.      Small businesses and citizens of targeted cities are still sifting through the rubble left behind by rioters while the media continues to turn a blind eye. Rosas' shocking account highlights the ways in which this fallout continues to haunt and devastate communities even to this day.      Thrilling, suspenseful, and packed cover-to-cover with jaw-dropping facts and never-before-told eyewitness accounts,  Fiery but Mostly Peaceful  pulls back the curtain and sets the record straight on a series of radical events across the country that, despite the media's attempts to convince Americans otherwise, were anything but peaceful.

Like the editor Perumal Murugan says, caste is like god, it is omnipresent.    The contributors write about the myriad ways in which they have experienced caste. It may be in the form of forgoing certain kinds of food, or eating food at secluded corners of a household, or drinking tea out of a crushed plastic cup, or drinking black coffee in a coconut shell or water poured from above into a cupped hand. Such experiences may also take the form of forbidden streets, friends disapproved of and love denied. And when one leaves behind the fear of caste while living one's life, there is still death to deal with. "

With  Badvertising , Simms and Murray have done the world an urgent favour. Funny and readable, it will make us all see advertising in a very different way'  Dr Chris van Tulleken, doctor, broadcaster and author of  Ultra-Processed People    'Hugely timely and important ... Grapples with advertising's role in enabling climate crimes \u2013 and sets out why and how we need to stop the industry's complicity in its tracks, for the sake of a liveable future'  Caroline Lucas MP   'Simms and Murray are clear-headed guides. Learn the history, be enraged at the tactics, and join the struggle for a less polluted public sphere'  Sam Knights, writer, actor and activist   'A much-needed book whose time has come. The continued advertising of high-carbon products at a time of climate crisis is a form of insanity. The authors are absolutely right'  Bill McGuire, Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences, University College London   'This book was a watershed moment for me. Since it can't have an advertising campaign, we all need to tell our friends about it'  Jeremy Vine, broadcaster and journalist  Advertising is selling us a dream, a lifestyle. It promises us fulfilment and tells us where to buy it \u2013 from international flights to a vast array of goods we consume like there is no tomorrow. The truth is, if advertising succeeds in keeping us on our current trajectory, there may not be a tomorrow.  In  Badvertising , Andrew Simms and Leo Murray raise the alarm on an industry that is making us both unhealthy and unhappy, and that is driving the planet to the precipice of environmental collapse in the process.  What is the psychological impact of being barraged by literally thousands of advertisements a day? How does the commercialisation of our public spaces weaken our sense of belonging? How are car manufacturers, airlines and oil companies lobbying to weaken climate action? Examining the devastating impact of advertising on our minds and on the planet,  Badvertising  also crucially explores what we can do to change things for the better.   Andrew Simms  was called a 'master at joined-up progressive thinking' by  New Scientist  magazine. He co-authored the original Green New Deal, came up with Earth Overshoot Day, and jointly proposed the Fossil Fuel Non- Proliferation Treaty. He is the author of several books including  Ecological Debt ,  Tescopoly ,  Cancel the Apocalypse  and  Economics: A Crash Course . He co-directs the New Weather Institute, is Assistant Director of Scientists for Global Responsibility, coordinates the Rapid Transition Alliance and is a Research Fellow at the University of Sussex.   Leo Murray  co-founded climate action charity Possible, where he is currently Director of Innovation, as well as noughties direct action pressure group Plane Stupid and pioneering solar rail enterprise Riding Sunbeams. Murray is also the creator of the Frequent Flyer Levy and the brains behind the Trump Baby blimp which rose to global fame during Donald Trump's US presidency. "

Until recently, they formed the most powerful media and political force in the land, for better or worse. Now their empire is cracking up and crashing down. For almost three decades, Fox News has not only made political careers (see: President Donald J. Trump) but also fundamentally altered the political landscape of the United States. It is a truism: as Fox goes, so goes the nation\u2014into further divisiveness and awash in fake news, a gleefully polarizing company. But just as Fox has pushed America apart, now it too is coming apart. As is the family dynasty behind it. In his irresistible trilogy on the chaotic presidency of Donald Trump\u2014 Fire and Fury ,  Siege , and  Landslide \u2014the gadfly journalist Michael Wolff led readers deep into the twisted corridors of the White House. Now, drawing on years of unprecedented access to the Murdoch family and key players in the world of Fox, he plunges us behind the scenes of another empire of influence, and the result is astonishing and unforgettable. Here is Rupert Murdoch, the ninety-two-year-old Australian billionaire\u2014a fading titan, concerned about his legacy but more concerned about profits. Here are his contentious progeny, jockeying to take over when the old man is gone. Here is star anchor Tucker Carlson, hiding out in his island homes, considering a run for the presidency while his bosses have other plans for him. Sean Hannity, the richest man in television, has his own plans: to put the former POTUS back in office, against the bosses' wishes. Meanwhile, Laura Ingraham is just trying to survive in the last man's man's world. Empires fall. Kingdoms come to an end. As lawsuits pummel the financial bedrock and reputation of the network, anchors scramble, and the battling Murdoch heirs make the Roys of TV's  Succession  seem downright Brady Bunch, Michael Wolff documents, in riveting and revelatory real time, the final days of Fox News.

                "This book is the first to define and describe 'social news', a new kind of journalism emerging in response to social media. Drawing on the author's extensive research into news and social media platforms,\u00a0 Social News\u00a0 critically examines the rise of well-known outlets such as\u00a0 BuzzFeed \u00a0and\u00a0 Mic \u00a0in the US, and\u00a0 Junkee \u00a0and\u00a0 Pedestrian \u00a0in Australia. Hurcombe argues that these outlets became successful by strategically engaging with social media, producing sociable content personalised for millennials. Such outlets have been criticised for violating the rules of 'quality' journalism. However, this book shows how social news has provided a platform for marginalised voices and has been able to engage readers neglected by legacy news. While social media is frequently seen as a threat to the news industry,\u00a0 Social News \u00a0shows that digital platforms have been driving new forms of journalism: ones that challenge our understanding of what journalism is, can be, and should be.

                "Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa get sued for alleged plagiarism and the majority of creators see pennies for their work, while the revenues of the record labels are exploding. Libraries struggle to give access to ebooks and get sued by an increasingly more powerful book industry, while publicly funded research papers get locked up.     Walled Culture  is the first book providing a compact, non-technical history of digital copyright and its problems over the last 30 years, and the social, economic and technological implications.     This book recounts the origins and unfolding of that historic clash of irreconcilable ideas by diving into how:  Big Content have lobbied lawmakers in the US, the EU, and elsewhere to pass harsh laws in an attempt to forbid people from accessing and sharing content;  As a result, the immense power of the Internet is being throttled, and the knowledge and culture that could flow freely to everyone is being walled up for a select few; and,  We are losing so much just to prop up outdated and inefficient business models, and what could be done to unleash the Internet's full potential and fairly remunerate creators by breaking down those walls.   Walled Culture tries to answer the following key questions:   What are the problems with copyright in the digital age?  Why does copyright harm creators and block global access to knowledge?  How does copyright threaten basic freedoms and undermine the Internet?  How can we promote creativity and help artists and make a living in the digital age?  What should we do to solve all these problems?. "

                "Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist James Ball takes us into the depths of the internet to trace the origins and rapid ascent of QAnon, the movement that mutated from a niche online conspiracy theory into the world's first digital pandemic.  Imagine a deadly pathogen that, once created, could infect any person in any part of the globe within seconds. No need to wait for travellers, trains, or air traffic to spread it, all you need is an internet connection. In this gripping investigation, Pulitzer Prize winner James Ball decodes the cryptic language of the online right and with a surgeon's precision tracks the spread of QAnon, the world's first digital pandemic. QAnon began as an internet community dedicated to supporting President Trump and intent on outing a global cabal of human traffickers. A short, cryptic message posted by an anonymous user to a niche internet forum in 2017 was the spark that ignited a global movement. What started as a macabre game of virtual make-believe quickly spiralled into the spread of virulently hateful, dangerous messaging \u2013 which turned into tragic, violent actions. Incoherent, chaotic, free from agendas: QAnon is a one-size-fits all cult conspiracy. From a standoff at the Hoover Dam, to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on 6 January 2021, to protesting COVID-19 lockdowns, this digital pandemic has spread globally and shows no signs of stopping. In  The Other Pandemic  Ball takes us into the niche pathways through which these digital pathogens spread, mutate and infect people all across the globe \u2013 but he also argues that the prognosis doesn't have to be dire. He shows us that it is possible to treat and cure this virus in order to build up our digital immune systems, and be better prepared to survive the next wave.  *A  Financial Times  Book to Read in 2023*.

                "A piercing portrait of the injustices of the Indian prison system.   For decades, the narratives around prisoners in India have perpetuated arbitrary notions of the 'good' and 'bad' citizen. Stories about Indian prisons rarely make it to public notice \u2013 from deplorable living conditions, lack of medical care and legal support to intense mistreatment, violence and all manner of horrific abuse. Despite the mounting evidence, any attempts to study the systemic frailties and chilling injustices that abound within a prison complex have been few and far between.  In  Hope Behind Bars , editors Sanjoy Hazarika and Madhurima Dhanuka draw upon extensive research, identifying prisoners and ex-prisoners, their families and associates and gathering first-person experiences about the Indian prison system. With ten essays contributed by subject specialists, including a former Supreme Court judge, lawyers, inmates, prison officials and activists, on a range of issues, such as the rights of prisoners, the journey to justice in the controversial Hashimpura killings case and life in a detention centre, this essential collection brings prisoners' lives and liberties to the heart of public debate and policies, presenting accounts of how hope can flower in the most unlikely places.  Searing and thought-provoking, it provides the reader with valuable insight into the vexed idea of incarceration and delivers a necessary human document of the true face of justice behind bars in our country.

                "How did a conspiracy theory reshape global politics? How did it tear families apart, inspire an insurrection and convince millions that a shadowy cabal was hellbent on eating children, and only Donald Trump could stop them? On the 6th of January, 2021 thousands of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol. Their banners read, Trust the Plan, a reference to an alarming conspiracy theory that had gained unstoppable momentum over the last four years: these were followers of QAnon. Decoding online clues from a mysterious figure \u2013 who has claimed to be a high-level government insider \u2013 QAnon adherents believe that Donald Trump has been anointed by God to stop a depraved deep state government, that sexually abuse, kill, and eat children. But QAnon has also become a broad church of out-there beliefs, offering a welcoming community to anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, eugenicists and white nationalists. With first hand access to the leading figures in the movement, investigative journalist Will Sommer unpacks the bizarre story of how a post from one of the darkest corners of the internet, became a belief system for millions; how politicians cozied up to extremists; how an unwavering trust in these ideas tore apart families, caused a mafia boss's assassination, and threatened democracy. Trust the Plan is a timely and essential look on how the internet radicalised our politics, and how millions were convinced to believe the unbelievable. "

The son of expat parents in colonial Nigeria, Ed was sent back to Britain to be educated by Benedictine monks at Ampleforth, at the time when, it was latter revealed, the school and monastery were the setting for serial abuse cases. He then went up to Cambridge, where his life as an undergraduate gave him access to a network of future ministers, judges and newspaper editors. As a young journalist, he reported first from party conferences and picket lines and then from war zones, witnessing the events making international headlines, from Haiti to Hong Kong, before returning home to join the infighting on BBC Radio 4's  Today . During this time, the Empire has given way to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, men-only clubs have been replaced by Me Too, and instead of a choice selection of voices on a handful of radio and television channels, we have millions of voices on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok. The world has changed, and so has Ed. Brought face to face with the author of his obituary and his own inevitable mortality, Ed is prompted to reflect on the life he has led and the events that have shaped him. In  Confessions , he describes this remarkable journey with candour, humour and the insight that only forty years' experience of writing and reporting can provide.  'A searingly honest insight into the life of one of our great journalists. Hugely entertaining too.' John Humphrys. "

Guilty of Journalism  is a joint production of The Censored Press and Seven Stories Press.  The legal action against Julian Assange is poised to culminate in a trial in the United States in 2023, and this book will help the public understand the proceedings. The establishment media's coverage of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's extradition case has focused on his deteriorating health and what CBS News called his \u201csecret family,\u201d but most of this coverage failed to detail the complex issues at stake against Assange.  Guilty of Journalism  outlines how WikiLeaks exposed the reality of American wars, the United States government\u2019s unprecedented indictment against Assange as a publisher, and the media\u2019s role in persuading the public to \u201cshoot the messenger.\u201d This new book by\u00a0Kevin Gosztola, who has spent the last decade covering Assange, WikiLeaks, and the wider war on whistleblowers, tells the full story based on testimony from dozens of witnesses. It   examines abuses of power by the CIA and the FBI, including a spying operation that targeted Assange\u2019s family, lawyers, and doctors.  Guilty of Journalism  offers a balanced and comprehensive perspective on all the events leading up to what press freedom advocates have called the trial of the century. "

The line between entertainment and reality, between fact and fiction, has become blurred. Some of the most crucial issues of our time\u2014climate change, vaccines, and genetically modified organisms\u2014have become prime targets for nefarious disinformation campaigns. Far too many people have become distrustful of real science. Even those who still trust science no longer know what to believe or how to identify the truth. Not only does this result in the devaluation and distrust of real science, but it is also dangerous: people acting based on false information can hurt themselves or those around them.   We must equip ourselves with the knowledge and skills to fight back against all this disinformation. InScience and the Skeptic: Discerning Fact from Fiction, you will learn how science is done, from the basic scientific method to the vetting process that scientific papers must go through to become published; how and why some people intentionally or unintentionally spread misinformation; and the dangers in believing and spreading false information. You'll also find twenty easy-to-follow rules for distinguishing fake science from the real deal. Armed with this book, empower yourself with knowledge, learning what information to trust and what to dismiss as deceit.   \"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic. . . .

                "A CNN insider reveals what he saw behind the scenes at the cable news giant and the investigation that revealed even more shocking secrets.  Cary Poarch started working at CNN in the summer of 2017 as a die-hard Bernie Sanders supporter. But on his first location shoot during the Charlottesville riots, he quickly became disillusioned with how the network created the \"fine people\" hoax.    This began a political odyssey as he documented numerous incidents of outright bias, eventually leading him to contact James O'Keefe of Project Veritas. For months, Cary Poarch documented CNN's rampant political bias for Project Veritas, and saw how the network was dividing the country. When the story was released by Project Veritas, it was seen by millions.    This book continues his investigation and uncovers even more shocking information about the behavior of network personnel, CNN's ties to the Biden White House, CNN's creation of a terrifying digital warfare capacity, and the possible penetration of CNN by our own intelligence agencies.    Cary partnered with two time  New York Times  bestselling author, Kent Heckenlively, and together they uncovered even more shocking secrets about \"the most trusted name in news. "

Voting in a Time of Change  is part of a longitudinal study by editors Kevin YL Tan and Terence Lee, who have been assembling trenchant analyses of each General Election by leading academics and commentators since GE2011. Their long game makes possible specific and unique insights. Of GE2020, this is what they have to say: \"The major political shift in Singapore that started in 2011 is marching on, even amidst a Covid-19 pandemic that was to have been a great disrupter. Whether we call this a 'New Normal'\u2014as many did back in 2011\u2014or otherwise is not as important as the momentum for change that has built up since then. Covid-19 thus became a political backdrop to a social and political shift that was merely searching for a catalyst.\" What insights and lessons can we carry forward to the next General Elections? This is an indispensable milestone publication for citizens who wish to commit to even more informed choices, and for political observers who are keeping close tabs on the evolution of our political landscape.

At least two of Aral\u2019s three predictions have come to fruition.\u201d\u2014 New York     NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY\u00a0 WIRED\u00a0 \u2022 LONGLISTED FOR THE PORCHLIGHT BUSINESS BOOK AWARD    Social media connected the world\u2014and gave rise to fake news and increasing polarization. It is paramount, MIT professor Sinan Aral says, that we recognize the outsize effect social media has\u00a0on us\u2014on our politics, our economy, and even our personal health\u2014in order to steer today\u2019s social technology toward its great promise while avoiding the ways it can pull us apart. Drawing on decades of his own research and business experience, Aral goes under the hood of the most powerful social networks to tackle the critical question of just how much social media actually shapes our choices, for better or worse. He shows how the tech behind social media offers the same set of behavior influencing levers to everyone who hopes to change the way we think and act\u2014from Russian hackers to brand marketers\u2014which is why its consequences affect everything from elections to business, dating to health. Along the way, he covers a wide array of topics, including how network effects fuel Twitter\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s massive growth, the neuroscience of how social media affects our brains, the real consequences of fake news, the power of social ratings, and the impact of social media on our kids. In mapping out strategies for being more thoughtful consumers of social media,  The Hype Machine  offers the definitive guide to understanding and harnessing for good the technology that has redefined our world overnight.

Universal access\u2014the idea that certain technologies and services should be extended to all regardless of geography or ability to pay\u2014evokes ideals of democracy and equality that must be reconciled with the realities on the ground. The COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness of the need for access to high-speed internet service in the United States, but this is just the latest in a long history of debates about what should be made available and to whom. Rural mail delivery, electrification, telephone service, public schooling, and library access each raised the same questions as today\u2019s debates about health care and broadband. What types of services should be universally available? Who benefits from extending these services? And who bears the cost? \u00a0 Stepping beyond humanitarian arguments to conduct a clear-eyed, diagnostic analysis, this book offers some surprising conclusions. While the conventional approach to universal access looks primarily at the costs to the system and the benefits to individuals, Harmeet Sawhney and Hamid Ekbia provide a holistic perspective that also accounts for costs to individuals and benefits for systems. With a comparative approach across multiple cases,  Universal Access and Its Asymmetries  is an essential exploration of the history, costs, and benefits of providing universal access to technologies and services. With a fresh perspective, it overturns common assumptions and offers a foundation for making decisions about how to extend service\u2014and how to pay for it. "

During the recent presidential election, \u201cmedia literacy\u201d became a buzzword that signified the threat media manipulation posed to democratic processes. Meanwhile, statistical research has shown that 8 to 18 year-olds pack more than eleven hours with some form of media into each day by \u201cmedia multitasking.\u201d Young people are not only eager and interested to learn about and discuss the realities of media ownership, production, and distribution, they also deserve to understand differential power structures in how media influences our culture.  The Media and Me  provides readers with the tools and perspectives to be empowered and autonomous media users. The book explores critical inquiry skills to help young people form a multidimensional comprehension of what they read and watch, opportunities to see others like them making change, and insight into their own identity projects. By covering topics like storytelling, building arguments and recognizing fallacies, surveillance and digital gatekeeping, advertising and consumerism, and global social problems through a critical media literacy lens, this book will help students evolve from passive consumers of media to engaged critics and creators.  The Media and Me  is a joint production of The Censored Press and Triangle Square Books for Young Readers. "

                "Introduction by Amal Clooney    From the recipient of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, an impassioned and inspiring memoir of a career spent holding power to account.    Maria Ressa is one of the most renowned international journalists of our time. For decades, she challenged corruption and malfeasance in her native country, the Philippines, on its rocky path from an authoritarian state to a democracy. As a reporter from CNN, she transformed news coverage in her region, which led her in 2012 to create a new and innovative online news organization, Rappler. Harnessing the emerging power of social media, Rappler   crowdsourced breaking news, found pivotal sources and tips, harnessed collective action for climate change, and helped increase voter knowledge and participation in elections.    But by their fifth year of existence, Rappler had gone from being lauded for its ideas to being targeted by the new Philippine government, and made Ressa an enemy of her country's most powerful man: President Duterte. Still, she did not let up, tracking government seeded disinformation networks which spread lies to its own citizens laced with anger and hate. Hounded by the state and its allies using the legal system to silence her, accused of numerous crimes, and charged with cyberlibel for which she was found guilty, Ressa faces years in prison and thousands in fines.    There is another adversary Ressa is battling. How to Stand Up to a Dictator is also the story of how the creep towards authoritarianism, in the Phillipines and around the world, has been aided and abetted by the social media companies. Ressa exposes how they have allowed their platforms to spread a virus of lies that infect each of us, pitting us against one another, igniting, even creating, our fears, anger, and hate, and how this has accelerated the rise of authoritarians and dictators around the world. She maps a network of disinformation\u2014a heinous web of cause and effect\u2014that has netted the globe: from Duterte's drug wars to America's Capitol Hill; Britain's Brexit to Russian and Chinese cyber-warfare; Facebook and Silicon Valley to our own clicks and votes.  Democracy is fragile. How to Stand Up to a Dictator is an urgent cry for Western readers to recognize and understand the dangers to our freedoms before it is too late. It is a book for anyone who might take democracy for granted, written by someone who never would. And in telling her dramatic and turbulent and courageous story, Ressa forces readers to ask themselves the same question she and her colleagues ask every day: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth?.

The Times  Political Book of the Year A  Daily Telegraph ,  Guardian ,  Daily Mail  and  FT  Book of the Year   '  Immensely   readable' -    Observer   Historically, the red wall formed the backbone of Labour's vote in the Midlands and the North of England but, during the 2019 general election, it dramatically turned Conservative for the first time in living memory, redrawing the electoral map in the process. Originally from the North East himself, Payne sets out to uncover the real story behind the red wall and what turned these seats blue. Beginning in Blyth Valley in the North East and ending in Burnley, with visits to constituencies across the Midlands and Yorkshire along the way, Payne gets to the heart of a key political story of our time that will have ramifications for years to come. While Brexit and the unpopularity of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn are factors, there is a more nuanced story explored in  Broken Heartlands  \u2013 of how these northern communities have fared through generational shifts, struggling public services, de-industrialization and the changing nature of work. Featuring interviews with local people, plus major political figures from both parties \u2013 including Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 Payne explores the significant role these social and economic forces, decades in the making, have played in this fundamental upheaval of the British political landscape.

Once one of Silicon Valley's greatest success stories, Facebook has been under constant fire for the past five years, roiled by controversies and crises. It turns out that while the tech giant was connecting the world, they were also mishandling users' data, spreading fake news, and amplifying dangerous, polarizing hate speech.  The company, many said, had simply lost its way. But the truth is far more complex. Leadership decisions enabled, and then attempted to deflect attention from, the crises. Time after time, Facebook's engineers were instructed to create tools that encouraged people to spend as much time on the platform as possible, even as those same tools boosted inflammatory rhetoric, conspiracy theories, and partisan filter bubbles. And while consumers and lawmakers focused their outrage on privacy breaches and misinformation, Facebook solidified its role as the world's most voracious data-mining machine, posting record profits, and shoring up its dominance via aggressive lobbying efforts.  Drawing on their unrivaled sources, Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang take readers inside the complex court politics, alliances and rivalries within the company to shine a light on the fatal cracks in the architecture of the tech behemoth. Their explosive, exclusive reporting led them to a shocking conclusion: The missteps of the last five years were not an anomaly but an inevitability\u2014this is how Facebook was built to perform. In a period of great upheaval, growth has remained the one constant under the leadership of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. Both have been held up as archetypes of uniquely 21st century executives\u2014he the tech \"boy genius\" turned billionaire, she the ultimate woman in business, an inspiration to millions through her books and speeches. But sealed off in tight circles of advisers and hobbled by their own ambition and hubris, each has stood by as their technology is coopted by hate-mongers, criminals and corrupt political regimes across the globe, with devastating consequences. In An Ugly Truth, they are at last held accountable. "

Reich, best-selling author of  The System   The lifeblood of any free society is persuasion: changing other people\u2019s minds in order to change things. But America is suffering a crisis of faith in persuasion that is putting its democracy and the planet itself at risk. Americans increasingly write one another off instead of seeking to win one another over. Debates are framed in moralistic terms, with enemies battling the righteous. Movements for justice build barriers to entry, instead of on-ramps. Political parties focus on mobilizing the faithful rather than wooing the skeptical. And leaders who seek to forge coalitions are labeled sellouts. In  The Persuaders,  Anand Giridharadas takes us inside these movements and battles, seeking out the dissenters who continue to champion persuasion in an age of polarization. We meet a leader of Black Lives Matter; a trailblazer in the feminist resistance to Trumpism; white parents at a seminar on raising adopted children of color; Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; a team of door knockers with an uncanny formula for changing minds on immigration; an ex-cult member turned QAnon deprogrammer; and, hovering menacingly offstage, Russian operatives clandestinely stoking Americans\u2019 fatalism about one another. As the book\u2019s subjects grapple with how to call out threats and injustices while calling in those who don\u2019t agree with them but just might one day, they point a way to healing, and changing, a fracturing country.

Information, says Janaki Srinivasan, has fundamentally reshaped development discourse and practice. In this study, she examines the history of the idea of \u201cinformation\u201d and its political implications for poverty alleviation. She presents three cases in India\u2014the circulation of price information in a fish market in Kerala, government information in information kiosks operated by a nonprofit in Puducherry, and a political campaign demanding a right to information in Rajasthan\u2014to explore three uses of information to support goals of social change. Countering claims that information is naturally and universally empowering, Srinivasan shows how the definition, production, and leveraging of information are shaped by caste, class, and gender.  Srinivasan draws on archival and ethnographic research to challenge the idea of information as objective and factual. Using the concept of an \u201cinformation order,\u201d she examines how the meaning and value of information reflect the social relations in which it is embedded. She asks why casting information as a tool of development and solution to poverty appeals to actors across the political spectrum. She also shows how the power to label some things information and others not is at least as significant as the capacity to subsequently produce, access, and leverage information. The more faith we place in what information can do, she cautions, the less attention we pay to its political lives and to the role of specific social structures, individual agency, and material form in the defining, production, and use of that information.

                "A National Bestseller!  A former Fox News political editor reveals how news organizations have succumbed to the temptation of \u201crage revenue\u201d through slanted coverage that drives political division and rewards outrageous conduct.   \u00a0  Rage revenue-addicted news companies are plagued by shoddy reporting, sensationalism, groupthink, and brain-dead partisan tribalism. Newsrooms rely on emotion-driven blabber to entrance conflict-addled super users.  \u00a0  In  Broken News , Chris Stirewalt, celebrated as one of America\u2019s sharpest political analysts in print and on television, employs his trademark wit and insight to give readers an inside look at these problems. He explains that these companies don\u2019t reward bad journalism because they like it, but because it is easy and profitable.  \u00a0  Take it from Stirewalt: As a top editor and election forecaster on Fox News\u2019 decision desk during the 2020 election, he knows firsthand what happens when viewers (including the president of the United States) become more accustomed to flattery and less willing to hear news that punctures their bubbles.  \u00a0  Broken News  is a fascinating, deeply researched, conversation-provoking study of how the news is made and how it must be repaired, with surprising takeaways about who\u2019s to blame. Stirewalt goes deep inside the history of the industry to explain how today\u2019s media divides America for profit. And he offers practical advice for how everyday readers, listeners and viewers can (and should) become better news consumers for the sake of the republic.  \u00a0  This is a book for those who care about our country\u2014and want the news to do the news again.

Focusing on the vernacular\u2019s most prominent character\u2014meaning change, this book attempts to account for the different dimensions and aspects that contribute to the memes\u2019 meaning and function variations, based on the quantitative and qualitative data meticulously collected by following and recording the various memes\u2019 diffusions on Chinese social media over four years. Through the discussion of four comprehensive case studies, what we experience as noticeable meaning change throughout a viral meme\u2019s diffusion may in fact be indexical to, under different circumstances, interpersonal communicative effects, collective identities, and community affiliations, as well as larger sociocultural values and ideologies, all of which can be reflexively performed, enacted, and calibrated in social media interactions. With such efforts, this book hopes to do justice to the complexities and dynamics of the \u201cChinese Internet Vernacular\u201d as a holistic sociolinguistic phenomenon. "

                "Very Short Introductions : Brilliant, Sharp, Inspiring   Violence is part and parcel of human history and of human nature. It is one of our most distinctive traits, the one thing that all cultures and societies, across time, share in common. It has defined not only the ways in which individuals relate to each other, but also how collective entities and states have interacted with each other over the millennia. All societies are violent and all individuals have the capacity for violence. However, not all societies and not all individuals are equally violent, and nor does violence exist with the same intensity across cultures. This Very Short Introduction examines the more visible, physical acts of violence - interpersonal, gendered, collective, religious, sexual, criminal, and political - in the modern world. It explores how violence in the pre-modern world was different from the modern world, and what is significant about those differences. It also discusses what violence is by examining understandings of the ideas, values, and cultural practices embedded in an act of violence, and considering acts of violence as the outcome of a process dependent on the cultural context in which they take place. Along the way Dwyer considers some core questions, asking whether violence is always 'bad', and if there are any limits to human violence? Why is it that what was once considered acceptable - wife beating, duelling, slavery - at some point becomes unacceptable in some societies and cultures, and yet continues in others? And finally, are we becoming more or less violent? ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable. "

Now, through recent interviews and the latest research, Fowler tells the extraordinary story of how a computer hacker with a turbulent childhood became holed up in London's Ecuador Embassy for seven years, and is now battling extradition to the USA from the notorious maximum security Belmarsh prison in London. Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg was called The Most Dangerous Man in America by the Nixon White House. In the Trump era, Ellsberg says Julian Assange, whose new journalism has made him powerful enemies, should be proud to be The Most Dangerous Man in the World. "

Joel Simon and Robert Mahoney, who have traveled the world for many years defending press freedom and journalists' rights as the directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists, chart the onslaught of COVID censorship beginning in China, through Iran, Russia, India, Egypt, Brazil, and inside the Trump White House. Increased surveillance in the name of public health, the collapse of public trust in institutions, and the demise of local news reporting all contributed to help governments hijack the flow of information and usurp power.

                "In this fun and informative YA Non-fiction title, Dustin Hansen, author of  Game On! , a self-confessed video game addict with over 20-years experience in the gaming industry, examines the storytelling skills shown in some of the most beloved and moving games of all time.  We all know that video games are fun, but can a video game make you cry? Can it tell you a powerful love story? Can a video game make you think differently about war? About the environment? About the choices you make? Whether it's playing through blockbuster-esque adventures (Uncharted, God of War, The Last of Us), diving deep into hidden bits of story and lore (Red Dead Redemption II, Bioshock, Journey) or building relationships that change the fate of the world itself (Persona 5, Undertale), video games are bringing stories to life in ways that are immediate, interactive and immersive.  Focusing on some of the best, most memorable, experiences in gaming,  The Greatest Stories Ever Played,  examines the relationship between gaming and storytelling in a new way. "

                "A  New York Times Book Review  Notable Book of 2017     \u2022    One of the best books of the year by  The New York Times,   LA Times , and NPR     Franklin Foer reveals the existential threat posed by big tech, and in his brilliant polemic gives us the toolkit to fight their pervasive influence.     Over the past few decades there has been a revolution in terms of who controls knowledge and information. This rapid change has imperiled the way we think. Without pausing to consider the cost, the world has rushed to embrace the products and services of four titanic corporations. We shop with Amazon; socialize on Facebook; turn to Apple for entertainment; and rely on Google for information. These firms sell their efficiency and purport to make the world a better place, but what they have done instead is to enable an intoxicating level of daily convenience. As these companies have expanded, marketing themselves as champions of individuality and pluralism, their algorithms have pressed us into conformity and laid waste to privacy. They have produced an unstable and narrow culture of misinformation, and put us on a path to a world without private contemplation, autonomous thought, or solitary introspection\u2014a world without mind. In order to restore our inner lives, we must avoid being coopted by these gigantic companies, and understand the ideas that underpin their success.\u00a0  \u00a0  Elegantly tracing the intellectual history of computer science\u2014from Descartes and the enlightenment to Alan Turing to\u00a0Stewart Brand and the hippie origins of today's Silicon Valley\u2014Foer exposes the dark underpinnings\u00a0of our most idealistic dreams for technology. The corporate ambitions of Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, he argues, are trampling longstanding liberal values, especially intellectual property and privacy. This is a nascent stage in the total automation and homogenization of social, political, and intellectual life.\u00a0By reclaiming our private authority over how we intellectually engage with the world, we have the power to stem the tide.   At stake is nothing less than who we are, and what we will become. There have been monopolists in the past but today's corporate giants have far more nefarious aims. They\u2019re monopolists who want access to every facet of our identities and influence over every corner of our decision-making. Until now few have grasped the sheer scale of the threat. Foer explains not just the looming existential crisis but the imperative of resistance. "

                "The convulsive history of foreign journalists in China starts with the newspapers printed in the European Factories of Canton in the 1820s and ends with the Communist revolution in 1949. It also starts with a duel between two editors over the China's future and ends with a fistfight in Shanghai over the revolution. The men and women of the foreign press experienced China's history and development; its convulsions and upheavals; revolutions and wars. They had front row seats at every major twist and turn in China's fortunes. They reported on the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion; saw the Summer Palace burn; endured the Boxer Rebellion; witnessed the Qing Dynasty's death, the birth of a Nationalist China and its struggle for survival against rampant warlordism. They followed the rise of the Communists, total war and then revolution. When the Unequal Treaties were signed, the foreign press were there; when foreign troops occupied and looted Beijing in 1900 they were present too; they saw the Republic born in 1911 and an increasingly politically strident China assert itself on May Fourth 1919. Foreign journalists stood in the streets witnessing the blood letting of the First Shanghai War in 1932 and then were blown of their feet by the bombing of the Second Shanghai War in 1937. They tracked Japanese aggression from the annexation of Manchuria, the fall of Shanghai and the Rape of Nanjing through to the assault on the Nationalist wartime capital of Chongqing as they cowered in the same bomb shelters as everybody else. They witnessed the fratricidal Civil War, the flight of Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan and the early days of the People's Republic. The old China press corps were the witnesses and the primary interpreters to millions globally of the history of modern China and they were themselves a cast of fascinating characters. Like journalists everywhere they took sides, they brought their own assumptions and prejudices to China along with their hopes, dreams and fears. They weren't infallible; they got the story completely wrong as often as they got it partially right. They were a mixed bunch\u2014from long timers such as George 'Morrison of Peking'; glamorous journalist-sojourners such as Peter Fleming and Emily Hahn; and reporter-tourists such as Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn along with numerous less celebrated, but no less interesting, members of the old China press corps. A fair few were drunks, philanderers and frauds; more than one was a spy\u2014they changed sides, they lost their impartiality, they displayed bias and a few were downright scoundrels and liars. But most did their job ably and professionally, some passionately and a select few with rare flair and touches of genius. "

                "The BBC holds a special place in the world of broadcasting. It derives its funding from a compulsory levy on people who may not even use the service. The protection it receives is justified on the grounds that it contributes to national welfare because of its role in 'public service broadcasting'. The authors of this book argue that the BBC's funding model is becoming untenable as technology changes. Furthermore, technology has also undermined the justification for government support for public service broadcasting. There is also major concern about bias at the BBC. However, the book concludes that bias is not confined to the BBC, but is common to all media providers. The problem is not bias as such, but the link between the BBC and the government, together with the compulsory funding model which does not allow people to not fund content of which they disapprove. Various options for reform are presented, concluding with a proposal for fullblown privatisation. It is concluded that this is the only way to realise the potential of an organisation that should be international in scope and which, under the current funding model, will become marginalised by media players operating worldwide across a range of platforms. This book is essential reading for anybody involved in public policy or the economics of broadcasting. "

It was a devastating triple punch. Capping their four-year campaign to destroy the Trump presidency, the media portrayed a Democratic victory as necessary and inevitable. Big Tech, wielding unprecedented powers, vaporized dissent and erased damning reports about the Biden family's corruption. And Democratic operatives, exploiting a public health crisis, shamelessly manipulated the voting process itself. Silenced and subjected, the American people lost their faith in the system.    RIGGED is the definitive account of the 2020 election.  Based on Mollie Hemingway's exclusive interviews with campaign officials, reporters, Supreme Court justices, and President Trump himself, it exposes the fraud and cynicism behind the Democrats' historic power-grab.   Rewriting history is a specialty of the radical left, now in control of America's political and cultural heights. But they will have to contend with the determination, insight, and eloquence of Mollie Hemingway. RIGGED is a reminder for weary patriots that truth is still the most powerful weapon. The stakes for our democracy have never been higher. "

Rejecting binary narratives on digital cultures, it showcases the fascinating ways in which we use our digital devices, social media platforms and apps by drawing upon academic research, everyday observations and a determination to challenge assumptions and hasty generalizations. It also engages with emerging narratives on online authenticity, privacy, digital detox, and the digital divides prevalent both in India and abroad. "

It's part of how the human brain works. Being aware of its existence and how it can creep into your life is the best defense. A growing feeder of confirmation bias in the modern world is the internet, particularly social media, where it's easy to surround yourself with a \"bubble\" of like-minded people. In this text we will explore the ways that the social media bubble encourages confirmation bias, and how to combat it. "

Alan Dershowitz has been called \"one of the most prominent and consistent defenders of civil liberties in America\" by  Politico  and \"the nation's most peripatetic civil liberties lawyer and one of its most distinguished defenders of individual rights\" by  Newsweek . He is also a fair-minded and even-handed expert on civil liberties and constitutional rights, and in this book offers his knowledge and insight to help readers understand the war being waged against meritocracy and equal protection of the law by so-called progressive advocates.     The Case for Color-Blind Equality in an Age of Identity Politics  is an analysis of every aspect of the current fight against true diversity\u2014diversity of philosophy, background, and opinion, rather than the more surface-level diversity of race, religion, and location. It examines the United States's history of systemic racism, debates about affirmative action, and ongoing reckoning with issues of bigotry against groups such as Asians, Blacks, and Jews, with an eye toward fairly balancing the concerns of a diverse populace.  In the end,  The Case for Color-Blind Equality in an Age of Identity Politics  represents an icon in American law and politics exploring the current rapidly changing attitudes toward meritocracy, personal identity, and the preservation of civil liberties for all citizens, regardless of background, race, class, or creed. It is essential reading for anyone interested in or concerned about identity politics, racial issues, and true diversity and fairness in America. "

Sandel  ''Wonderfully illuminating of our interdependence''  Amartya Sen  ''A powerful and persuasive moral argument ... rigorous and specific enough to help readers think practically about the policies needed''  Melinda Gates  \u2014- The social contract shapes everything: our political institutions, legal systems and material conditions, but also the organisation of family and community, our well-being, relationships and life prospects. And yet everywhere, the social contract is failing.  Accelerating changes in technology, demography and climate will reshape our world in ways many of us have yet to grasp. In this landmark study, Minouche Shafik, Director of the London School of Economics, draws on evidence from across the globe to identify the key principles every society must adopt if it is to meet the challenges of the coming century, with profound implications for gender equality, education, healthcare provision, the role of business and the future of work.  How should society pool risks, share resources and balance individual with collective responsibility? Brilliantly lucid and accessible,  What We Owe Each Other  offers new answers to these age-old questions and equips every reader to understand and play their part in the urgent and necessary transformation ahead. \u2014- ''A necessary contribution at a turning-point in history ... a must-read''  Ursula von der Leyen   ''Beautifully argued ... a must-read for all those seeking to understand why the bonds that bind society together are so frayed and what we can do about it''  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala   ''Weaves economics, philosophy, wisdom and common sense into a social contract of simplicity, solidity and harmony.

Naturally, as Singaporeans have become better informed and more engaged in fashioning their own future, the nature of the contest among the political parties has also shifted.This book is a collection of speeches presented at Singapore Perspectives 2020 by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat, as well as Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. It also features speeches and discussions by public intellectuals and civic leaders. Each speaker presents a perspective on their 'experience' of politics, both in the traditional sense of elections and governance as well as beyond those formal structures. "

No one is exempt from data mining: by owning a smartphone, or using social media or a credit card, we hand over private data to corporations and the government. We need to understand how surveillance and data collection operates in order to regain control over our digital freedoms\u2014and our lives. Attorney and data privacy expert Heidi Boghosian unpacks widespread myths around the seemingly innocuous nature of surveillance, sets the record straight about what government agencies and corporations do with our personal data, and offers solutions to take back our information.\u00a0 \u201cI Have Nothing to Hide\u201d \u00a0is both a necessary mass surveillance overview and a reference book .\u00a0 It addresses the misconceptions around tradeoffs between privacy and security, citizen spying, and the ability to design products with privacy protections. Boghosian breaks down misinformation surrounding 21 core myths about data privacy, including: \u25cf \u201cSurveillance makes the nation safer.\u201d \u25cf \u201cNo one wants to spy on kids.\u201d \u25cf \u201cPolice don\u2019t monitor social media.\u201d \u25cf \u201cMetadata doesn\u2019t reveal much about me.\u201d \u25cf \u201cCongress and the courts protect us from surveillance.\u201d \u25cf \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do to stop surveillance.\u201d By dispelling myths related to surveillance, this book helps readers better understand what data is being collected, who is gathering it, how they\u2019re doing it, and why it matters.
