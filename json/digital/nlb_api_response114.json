Her identity is unknown, and the handful of American coins and the precious diamond sown into her dress only deepen the mystery.   Grace Ware is an enemy to the English crown. Her father, an Irish military commander of Napoleon's defeated army. Her mother, an exiled Scottish Jacobite. When Grace took shelter in a warehouse, running from her father's murderers through the harbor alleyways of Antwerp, she never anticipated bad luck to deposit her at the home of an aristocrat in the Scottish Borders. Baronsford is the last place she could expect to find safety, and Grace feigns a loss of memory to buy herself time while she recovers.   Hugh is taken by her beauty, passion, and courage to challenge his beliefs and open his mind. Grace finds in him a wounded man of honor, proud but compassionate. When their duel of wits quickly turns to passion and romance, Grace's fears begin to dissolve...until danger follows her to the very doors of Baronsford. For, unknown to either of them, Grace has in her possession a secret that will wreak havoc within the British government. Friend and foe are indistinguishable as lethal forces converge to tear the two lovers apart or destroy them both.   \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Hugh and Grace are a well-matched pair, and the authors give their relationship ample, and realistic, room to grow....This is a series, and readers will be happy to follow into the next installment.   - Jane Jorgenson, Library Journal Review   \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 An outstanding read....The characters in this book are phenomenal. Grace and Hugh's story is loaded with suspense, action, drama, humor and sizzle. This story grabbed me on page one and didn't let go until the last page.   \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 From start to finish, it was packed with action, mystery, romance, spy vs spy, murder, you name it, it has it all! and darn, I just couldn't seem to put it down that I just had to finish it in one sitting.

Aubrey Gates is the hottest divorce lawyer in Chicago, a barb-tongued stiletto with legs that go on for miles. When her cool gray eyes meet mine across the battlefield, I want her like I've never wanted anyone or anything. Then I remember who she is: the woman who brought me to my knees. The woman who destroyed my faith in relationships.    The woman I used to call . . . wife.    And she needs a favor.    It seems my ex forgot to mention the demise of our marriage to her dear old grammie, and now we're both expected to attend her ninetieth birthday party. In Boston. And because it isn't already awkward enough, Aubrey and I are driving there together from Chicago. That's more than a thousand miles of tension, heartbreak, and barely concealed lust.    A little piece of paper might say we're over, but this road trip is the true test. I intend to get my wife back . . .    \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAnd I won't stop until \"I do.\"    Previously published. "

Ella Boudreaux hasa lot to prove to her family, friends, and foes\u2014and to herself. So when her marriage ends she decides to invest her energy and money into a place that brings back some of Ella's happiest memories: the Abbott brothers' garage. Maybe, if she puts her mind to it, she can teach skeptical, stubborn Mack Abbott how to make the business a true success.

Can her new community of zombies, vampires, and shapeshifters come to her rescue when she needs them most?      When Edie was fired from her paranormal nursing job at County Hospital, her whole world came crashing down. Now she's is once again shaken to her core. Her mother is deathly ill and there's only one thing that will save her: vampire blood. But with the paranormal community shunning Edie, where can she obtain it...without losing her own life in the process?      Edie hopes to procure it at her new job at the clinic across town, where the forces of evil loom large. Vampire gang wars are rampant. Old underground enemies are rising to the surface. And Edie's zombie ex-boyfriend has arrived at the scene-but is he the same man he used to be? And what should she make of the enigmatic doctor with whom she shares an unexpected connection? She'll have to figure it out soon, because all hell is about to break loose-literally-and time is running out...     \"Shapeshifted&nbsp;is the third Cassie Alexander novel I've read, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. Edie Spence, Alexander's nurse protagonist, has a real talent for getting into trouble and somehow getting out of it, but each time she seems to have sacrificed something, even if it's only her couch. And she's so often sleep-deprived, I worry a little about her patients. But Edie is loyal and tough and determined, and these are all characteristics you want in an urban fantasy hero, which she certainly is. In this book, Edie finds her mother has cancer, and Edie wants some vampire blood to cure her. But Edie's being shunned by the supernatural community. How's she going to get it? A loose plot point or two get tied up in this book, but other threads are left open. We can all look forward to what happens next.\"\u2014New York Times bestselling author Charlaine Harris. "

His passing comes as she prepares to undertake a harrowing expedition to the lost ruins of Axum, capital of an ancient kingdom, famous home of the Queen of Sheba, and the possible resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. Ceseli hopes to uncover Axum's long-forgotten archaeological mysteries on her own.     What she does not count on, though, is Benito Mussolini's looming invasion of Ethiopia, which plunges her already dangerous journey into chaos. Nor does she expect the feeling she discovers for a young Italian doctor, nor the romance that blossoms between them.     Love in the Land of Barefoot Soldiers is a sweeping tale of romance and war, as Ceseli is caught between the movements of empires and her growing love for a young Italian medic. History and the destruction of the modern era collide in this exciting drama. "

Small Florida coastal towns often find themselves scrambling for the tourism dollars that the Orlando theme parks leave behind. And within the town limits of Boneyard Key, the residents decided long ago to lean into its ghostliness. Nick Royer, owner of the Hallowed Grounds coffee shop, embraces the ghost tourism that keeps the local economy afloat, as well as his spectral roommate. At least he doesn\u2019t have to run air-conditioning.\u00a0 Cassie Rutherford possibly overreacted to all her friends getting married and having kids by leaving Orlando and buying a flipped historic cottage in Boneyard Key. Though there\u2019s something  unusual  with her new home (her laptop won\u2019t charge in any outlets, and the poetry magnets on her fridge definitely didn\u2019t read \u201cWRONG\u201d and \u201cMY HOUSE\u201d when she put them up), she\u2019s charmed by the colorful history surrounding her. And she's catching a certain vibe from the grumpy coffee shop owner whenever he slips her a free slice of banana bread along with her coffee order. As Nick takes her on a ghost tour, sharing town gossip that tourists don't get to hear, and they spend nights side-by-side looking into\u00a0the former owners of her haunted cottage,\u00a0their connection solidifies into something very real and enticing. But Cassie's worried she\u2019s in too deep with this whole (haunted) home ownership thing\u2026and Nick's afraid to get too close in case Cassie gets scared away for good. "

                "Ancient gods. Modern war. And a star-crossed couple who could use some divine intervention.   The day I was drafted into the army of the gods, all I knew about being a MASH surgeon was what I'd learned from Hawkeye Pierce and Hot Lips Houlihan. Now here I am, Dr. Petra Robichaud, in the middle of an immortal war, assigned to a MASH camp with a nosy sphinx, a vegetarian werewolf, and an uptight vampire who really needs to get a life.   At least they're all too busy with their own dramas to discover my secret: I can see the dead. It's a forbidden gift, one that can get me killed, so I haven't told a soul.   Until the arrestingly intense Galen arrives on my operating table, half-dead and totally to-die-for. When his spirit tries to slip out of his fatally wounded body, I impulsively slip it back in. Call it a rash resurrection. One I'll live to regret.   Now Commander Galen of Delphi knows my secret, and he's convinced I'm part of an ancient prophecy\u2014one that can end the war for good. But taking a chance could cost me everything. And it would be easier to convince him to leave me alone, except now the prophecies are starting to come true...       Warning: This novel contains a hefty dose of danger, drama, practical jokes, pet swamp lizards, brooding demigods, adventure, romance, and heart\u2014in a MASH camp where everybody knows your business.       *The core of this book was originally called Immortally Yours, published by St. Martin's Press in 2012. The author has rewritten it into the way she always envisioned the story to be, which means it is now a romantic comedy instead of an angsty book. Oh, and there are a lot more pet swamp lizards, too.

As the boy and a girl sit talking in the backyard, memory gives way to imagination and vulnerability, and the space between them becomes charged with emotional electricity.    Their resulting conversation is both a meditation on the storytelling impulse and a gripping narrative of first love that, through its particulars, ascends to the universal. "

But as much as James gets on her nerves, he's also getting under her skin, and the tension between them sizzles just as devastatingly as before.  As undeniable sparks turn James and Laila\u2019s battle royal into a more serious game of hearts, nanny and bodyguard will have to decide just how much they\u2019re willing to risk for a second chance at love.

Sebastian   It's my final season to prove myself before the MLB draft. The last thing I need is a distraction\u2014and especially not one as tantalizing as Mia di Angelo.

But when she needs somewhere to stay for the summer... well, I offer her my place.  Being roommates shouldn't be so hard. Not distracting at all. Not the least bit challenging...   Mia   I have two goals this summer: get into a study abroad program and get over golden baseball god Sebastian Miller-Callahan.  Doesn't mean it's easy to stop thinking about him, but he deserves better than a prickly, career-focused girl like me. Our futures can't be more different. The last thing I need is to play roommates with the only man who can set my body ablaze.  And all the feelings I've tried to pretend I never had? They come rushing back far too strong for either of us to ignore.  Filled with swoons, spice, sports, and second chances, Stealing Home is a don't-miss adult college sports romance. "

London, 1803     As the daughter of a renowned actress, Verity Travers is a privileged lady of high society \u2014and the last woman one would suspect of working as a private investigator. But after one case nearly costs her everything, she makes the hard decision to hang up her hat and live the uninspiring life of a gentlewoman. However, when she and her dearest friend become victims of a harrowing armed robbery, Verity finds herself swept back into the clandestine world of mystery and crime as she seeks to bring the thief to justice. There's just one complication: the persistent and dashingly handsome Bow Street Runner Nathaniel Denning, who always seems to cross her path.    Verity is confident she could accomplish her work quickly if only Nathaniel would stay out of her way. While she appreciates his keen mind and quick wit on a case, his interference is muddling her progress\u2014and her heart. Focusing on the task at hand becomes more and more difficult as she constantly bumps into Nathaniel, who is determined to keep her out of danger.    When the two rival investigators learn they are both pursuing the same cunning criminal, they must figure out how to navigate the delicate dance of cooperation amid a backdrop of increasing peril and an irresistible passion that sets their hearts ablaze.

Now, Lady Joan finds herself trapped in a cave on Christmas Eve with the great Edmund de Grave and neither are very happy about it. He's fuming because his plan was spoiled and worrying about his brother, now in enemy hands. She's perturbed that a man she thought a hero is the type to get a lady \"with child\" outside of marriage.

                "An exiled princess teams up with the last man she thought she could trust in the start of a dazzling and unforgettable epic fantasy romance series.  As a child, Elowen Atarah was ripped away from her dragons and imprisoned by her father, King Garrick of Imirath. Years later, Elowen is now a woman determined to free her dragons. Having established a secret kingdom of her own called Aestilian, she\u2019s ready to do what\u2019s necessary to save her people and seek vengeance. Even if that means having to align herself with the Commander of Vareveth, Cayden Veles, the most feared and dangerous man in all the kingdoms of Ravaryn. Cayden is ruthless, lethal, and secretive, promising to help Elowen if she will stand with him and all of Vareveth in the pending war against Imirath. Despite their contrasting motives, Elowen can\u2019t ignore their undeniable attraction as they combine their efforts and plot to infiltrate the impenetrable castle of Imirath to steal back her dragons and seek revenge on their common enemy. As the world tries to keep them apart, the pull between Elowen and Cayden becomes impossible to resist. Working together with their crew over clandestine schemes, the threat of war looms, making the imminent heist to free her dragons their most dangerous adventure yet. But for Elowen, her vengeance is a promise signed in blood, and she\u2019ll stop at nothing to see that promise through. An immersive fantasy filled with a sizzling reluctant-allies-to-lovers romance, a world to get lost in, dangerous quests, dragon bonds, and an entertaining band of characters to root for,  Fear the Flames  marks the stunning debut of Olivia Rose Darling.

                "In this elegant gothic horror tale set in post-revolutionary Russia, two formerly aristocratic sisters race to uncover their family's long-buried secrets in a house haunted by a past dangerous \u2013 and deadly \u2013 to remember. It is the summer of 1921, and a group of Bolsheviks have taken over Irina and Lili Goliteva's ancestral home in Moscow, a stately mansion falling into disrepair and decay. The remaining members of their family are ordered to move into the cramped attic, while the officials take over an entire wing of grand rooms downstairs. The sisters understand it is the way of things and know they must forget their noble upbringing to make their way in this new Soviet Russia. But the house begins to whisper of a traumatic past not as dead as they thought. Eager to escape it and their unwelcome new landlords, Irina and Lili find jobs with the recently arrived American Relief Administration, meant to ease the post-revolutionary famine in Russia. For the sisters, the ARA provides much-needed food and employment, as well as a chance for sensible Irina to help those less fortunate and artistic Lili to express herself for a good cause. It might just lead them to love, too. But at home, the spirits of their deceased family awaken, desperate to impart what really happened to them during the Revolution. Soon one of the officials living in the house is found dead. Was his death caused by something supernatural, or by someone all too human? And are Irina and Lili and their family next? Only unearthing the frightening secrets of Moscow House will reveal all. But this means the sisters must dig deep into a past no one in Russia except the dead are allowed to remember. "

With little-to-no renovation experience, but a large sum of inheritance money, Lane enlists the help of her friend Matt \u2013 mechanic by trade, handyman by practice, and hottie by nature. While their mutual attraction is undeniable, Matt's a total family guy with 'settle down with me' tattooed across his forehead, whereas Lane is entirely commitment averse.

So when Matt offers to help her with the bus, and in the bedroom, Lane's sure it can never work... can it?. "

                "Can a dare made at Notting Hill Carnival turn into true love?  He's All That  meets  How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days  in this trope-filled sizzling summer romance ,  perfect for fans of Joya Goffney and Lynn Painter.      Popular girl  Eva   \u00d2j\u00f3   is used to boys falling for her without her even trying. So when her friend dares her to dance with a random guy at  Notting Hill Carnival , she meets Saint.  Comic obsessed  Saint Rowe-Falade  thinks Eva is cute, but he's not interested in her in that way. He'd rather get lost in stories than look for romance.  When Eva's birthday party gets out of control and causes damage to her dad's beloved car, her friends set the  ultimate dare : get Saint to take her on  one date  and they'll help her pay to fix her dad's car. Operation fall-in-love-with-Eva is set in motion and Eva makes it her mission to make Saint fall head over heels. But just as Saint starts to warm to Eva, and her own  feelings  towards him grow, Saint finds out about the dare. Can Eva convince Saint she's truly into him, or has she lost him for good?  PRAISE FOR ABIOLA BELLO'S LOVE IN WINTER WONDERLAND:   'A screen-worthy holiday romance.'

                "Phoebe MacLeod is back with a BRAND NEW hilarious rom com, perfect for fans of Sophie Ranald and Sophie Kinsella. For Beatrice, working at one of London's boutique hotels is a dream come true. She doesn't need a social life. She just needs an ordered diary, crisply folded sheets and happy guests. But Beatrice's routine comes to an abrupt halt when her hotel is raided by the police. Suddenly she finds herself released on bail, and trapped in London, with only the hotel chef Jock for company.  Having decided to make the most of their situation, Beatrice lets her hair down \u2013 figuratively and literally \u2013 for the first time in her life. And incredibly, despite the threat of possible prison around the corner, she finds she loves every moment spent exploring London in Jock's company.  But all bubbles have to burst, so when the pair are released without charge, it's time for Beatrice to get her life, and her career, back on track. She can't let a little thing called feelings get in her way... So why can't she forget Jock, even when her career dreams look set to become reality?  Beatrice may like to keep life fully booked, but can you ever really be too busy for love?   Readers LOVE Phoebe MacLeod's books:   ' The perfect book.

Previously published as Amber by Night, from New York Times best-selling author Sharon Sala.  From nine to five, she was Amelia Beauchamp, typical small-town librarian who lived with her loving elderly aunts. But every night, looking for a chance of freedom, Amelia turned into miniskirt-clad cocktail waitress Amber Champion...and she'd caught the eye of the town's biggest rake, Tyler Savage. \"Amber\" was certain she had to keep playing the secret identity game, as Tyler would never be interested in her if he knew who she really was, and her family would never approve their relationship. But Tyler had figured out that proper Amelia and flirtatious Amber were one and the same. Both Amelia and Tyler were having a fine old time playing a game of secrets and lies, with romantic dinners and long, moonlit nights together. All it took was a leap of trust to give their love a real chance. "

                "The BRAND NEW hilarious rom com from the bestselling author of THE FIXER UPPER, perfect for fans of Lindsey Kelk and Sophie Kinsella.  Can Autumn turn her life around?   As spring flowers start to bloom in London, Autumn's life is looking up! She has a great relationship with her brilliant teenage daughter Chloe and she's on track to be Deputy Head at the London school where she works. And with a pay rise on the cards, she's excited for her and her long-term boyfriend Marc to buy their first home.  But Autumn's barely opened the estate agent's website when Marc vanishes with half their savings, leaving her no choice but to move into grandma's rural home in Kent. And things go from bad to worse when Autumn is involved in an accident during the move, leaving the village's dashing new baker Jake in plaster cast, and making her a local outcast before she's even unpacked her bags.  Determined to put things right, Autumn offers to help Jake in the bakery over the summer holidays. But as things heat up in the kitchen, Autumn can't help noticing that Jake is a lot more Paul Hollywood and a lot less Mr Kipling than she originally thought.  Maybe this summer isn't such a write off after all?   Readers LOVE Phoebe MacLeod's books:   ' The perfect book.

Three unspeakable horrors.  The Finch sisters once spent long, hot summers exploring the dozens of abandoned properties littering their dying town\u2014until they found an impossible home with an endless hall of doors...and three keys left waiting for them. Curious, fearless, they stepped inside their chosen rooms, and experienced horrors they never dared speak of again.  Now, years later, youngest sister Claire has been discovered dead in that old, desiccated house. Haunted by their sister's suicide and the memories of a past they've struggled to forget, Meg and Esther find themselves at bitter odds. As they navigate the tensions of their brittle relationship, they draw unsettling lines between Claire's death, their own haunted memories, and a long-ago loss no one in their family has ever been able to face. With the house once again pulling them ever-closer, Meg and Esther must find the connection between their sister's death and the shadow that has chased them across the years...before the darkness claims them, too.   As emotional as it is haunting, Through the Midnight Door explores the sometimes-fragile bonds of sisterhood and the way deeply rooted trauma can pass from generation to generation.    \"A gorgeously realized, deeply affecting horror story about sisterhood, secrets, and all the things that can haunt someone.\"\u2014\u00a0Layne Fargo, author of They Never Learn.

Adya wants nothing more than to be left alone. Content to be loyal to no one but herself in the isolated jungles of South India, she dreams only of finding her lost sister, Priya, and making enough money to take care of their family. It's too bad that her rare ability to wake electric machines\u2014using the magic that wiped them out five centuries ago\u2014also makes her a coveted political pawn. Everyone seems to believe that her technomancy can help them win the endless war for control over the magic's supernatural source.   These senseless power struggles mean little to Adya. But when her enemies dangle news of her sister before her, she's all too quick to leap at the chance to bring Priya home\u2014even if it means teaming up with a rakish, disreputable thief in order to do it. With the threat of invasion looming ever larger on the horizon, Adya must reconcile the kind of person she is with the kind of person she wants to be and untangle the web of intrigue, conspiracy, and deceit that threatens to take all of India down with it.

It's not easy serving Chernobog, the God of Destruction, Darkness and Death...especially during the holidays; and especially when you're out of eggnog and one of your pesky, freeloading mythic creatures has eaten your last cookie. Roman would like nothing more than to be left alone, but when a wounded boy stumbles into his yard and begs for sanctuary, Roman takes him in. Now elite mercenaries are camped out on his property, combat mages are dousing the house with fire, and strange priests are unleashing arcane magic. They thought Roman was easy pickings, just a hermit in the woods, but they chose the wrong dark priest to annoy. For while Roman might be patient, he is the Black Volhv, filled with the love of his terrible god. For his adversaries, it's a fight to the death, but for him, it's just another day in the neighborhood.  Includes a bonus short story and more!. "

When Elk's well goes dry, it is Gesela's turn to save her town by killing the toad that lives at the bottom. Except...the toad is not a toad at all. He is an Elven prince under a curse of his own, and upon his death, his brothers come for Gesela, seeking retribution.  As punishment, the princes banish Gesela to live with their seventh brother, the one they call the beast. Gesela expects to be the prisoner of a hideous monster, but the beast turns out to be exquisitely beautiful, and rather than lock her in a cell, he offers Gesela a deal. If she can guess his true name in seven days, she can go free.  Gesela agrees, but there is a hidden catch\u2014she must speak his name with love in order to free him, too.  But can either of them learn to love in time?. "
