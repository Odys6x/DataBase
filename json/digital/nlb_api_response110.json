Her search for answers eventually led her to look within herself where she discovered the cause of her depression. By going within she found that all of us can create our own reality by subconsciously choosing to be a victim of our own minds, and by her accepting and understanding this, she was able to break the cycle and return to a normal and happier life. Through sharing her own story, Eileen hopes that other people will benefit from her experience and, hopefully they too, will discover the true meaning of life.  Why be a victim, when you can choose to be a survivor?. "

But what about the other victims of addiction--the spouses, families, and caretakers suffering (not so quietly) in the background, so involved in the addict's problems that they are unable to identify and solve their own? There are myriad books and programs dealing with addiction, but only a handful of them address the specific issues of codependency. This two-books-in-one volume provides a complete blueprint for codependent recovery. Written with warmth, gentleness, and great compassion by Melody Beattie,  Codependent No More  has been a healing touchstone for millions, pointing the way to a lifetime of health, hope, and happiness.

If you've answered yes to any of these questions, you desperately need HOW TO CALM DOWN.  In a reassuring and approachable tone, Fred Miller reminds his reader to breathe-the difficult-to-remember but absolutely essential step to keeping your cool.  In each chapter thereafter, he offers a new suggestion for how to calm down, covering everything from remaining in the moment rather than reliving past frustrations to visualizing your own personal movie.  The author also proposes ways for the reader to achieve a calm focus and most importantly, how to maintain it. "

In this repackaged book, sixty devotions are divided into sections&#8212;diagnosis, surgery, treatment, and recovery&#8212;each incorporating Scripture into daily life. It also includes a new chapter on living with the possibility that cancer may return. Ortega's attention to even the most basic hopes and fears that a cancer patient faces each day offers encouragement that can come only from one who has been there herself. "

She traces the interconnected recovery \"industry,\" from talk shows to drug treatment centers, and examines its impact on contemporary political life. Condemning the movement for ignoring real social problems, Rapping nonetheless makes a surprising argument: that the recovery phenomenon owes much of its success to the insights and strategies of second-wave feminism, even as it turns its back on the women's movement's political message.
