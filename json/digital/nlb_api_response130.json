Over the last decade, he has grown from hot new thing to horror icon without compromising on his uniquely inexplicable nightmares.\" \u2013 Esquire    \"[A] deliciously confusing thriller.\" \u2013 Weekend Edition (NPR)    A cleverly voiced psychological thriller from the nationally bestselling author of The Cabin at the End of the World and Survivor Song.   What if the coolest girl you've ever met decided to be your friend?  Art Barbara was so   not cool. He was a seventeen-year-old high school loner in the late 1980s who listened to hair metal, had to wear a monstrous back-brace at night for his scoliosis, and started an extracurricular club for volunteer pallbearers at poorly attended funerals. But his new friend thought the Pallbearers Club was cool. And she brought along her Polaroid camera to take pictures of the corpses.  Okay, that part was a little weird.  So was her obsessive knowledge of a notorious bit of New England folklore that involved digging up the dead. And there were other strange things \u2013 terrifying things \u2013 that happened when she was around, usually at night. But she was his friend, so it was okay, right?  Decades later, Art tries to make sense of it all by writing The Pallbearers Club: A Memoir. But somehow this friend got her hands on the manuscript and, well, she has some issues with it. And now she's making cuts.  Seamlessly blurring the lines between fiction and memory, the supernatural and the mundane, The Pallbearers Club is an immersive, suspenseful portrait of an unusual and disconcerting relationship. "

                "In her brilliant debut, Storey brings early 16th-century Florence alive, entering with extraordinary empathy into the minds and souls of two Renaissance masters, creating a stunning art history thriller. From 1501 to 1505, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti both lived and worked in Florence. Leonardo was a charming, handsome fifty year-old at the peak of his career. Michelangelo was a temperamental sculptor in his mid-twenties, desperate to make a name for himself. Michelangelo is a virtual unknown when he returns to Florence and wins the commission to carve what will become one of the most famous sculptures of all time: David. Even though his impoverished family shuns him for being an artist, he is desperate to support them. Living at the foot of his misshapen block of marble, Michelangelo struggles until the stone finally begins to speak. Working against an impossible deadline, he begins his feverish carving. Meanwhile, Leonardo's life is falling apart: he loses the hoped-for David commission; he can't seem to finish any project; he is obsessed with his ungainly flying machine; he almost dies in war; his engineering designs disastrously fail; and he is haunted by a woman he has seen in the market\u2014a merchant's wife, whom he is finally commissioned to paint. Her name is Lisa, and she becomes his muse. Leonardo despises Michelangelo for his youth and lack of sophistication. Michelangelo both loathes and worships Leonardo's genius.  Oil and Marble  is the story of their nearly forgotten rivalry.  Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction\u2014novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.

                "A gripping, suspense-filled thriller from the author of the internationally best-selling Hammarby series. A deadly secret haunts a group of strangers who cross paths in the snow of a Swedish midwinter...    'Plotted with the complexity of a labyrinth'   New York Times         January in Gotland. The days are short, the air is cold, and all the roads are covered in snow. On a deserted, icy backroad, these wintry conditions bring together a group of strangers with a force devastating enough to change their lives forever. A deadly accident and two separate crimes leave victims in their wake. Four years later, a single phone call is all it takes to bring back the terror of that day and to set in motion a plot for revenge. For Sandra it started as an unremarkable winter's day of shopping followed by a kind gesture from a stranger. For Jeanette it began with the thrill of an illicit rendezvous with her lover. Both women had driven past the same icy ravine. Only one was in the car that caused a deadly crash. Only one left a man to die alone in the snow... Each carried a secret from that day, a secret that, if revealed, could connect them to a larger, more terrible transgression. And there is someone out there who knows the whole picture, and who would rather kill than allow it all to come to light...  Reviewers on Carin Gerhardsen:  'The author's mastery of tone imbues a largely tragic tale with touches of humor. By turns touching and terrifying, this nail-biter deserves a wide audience.'

It begins with  PLAGUE ...   Winner of the Arthur Ellis Award for Best Crime Novel from the Canadian Crime Writers Association.   1665. On a dark road outside London, a highwayman stumbles upon slaughter...  As plague grips the city, can the uneasy alliance of a thief, a thief-taker and an actress catch a serial killer?    'A rich and addictive read, ideal for fans of historical fiction.' Publisher's Weekly  'With Kings and cripples, rats and rotters, highwaymen and loose women, you'd never think a lethal virus could be so much fun.' Sunday Sport UK  'Fast, exciting historical adventure, to be read in huge gulps. A runaway carriage of a book.' Conn Iggulden, author of War of the Roses  'It's a brilliant depiction of seventeenth century London in all its glory and grime against the grim backdrop of the eponymous plague. A great read all round, and for my money Chris is better than Sansom and more than deserves equal success.' Simon Scarrow, Author of Centurion.  'PLAGUE is one of those books where you turn the last page and wish there were more. The very best of history, mystery, romance and sheer fun. (Well, and a few rats...) London itself is as vivid a character as the actors, adventurers and intriguers who people its all-too-few pages.' Diana Gabaldon   And continues through 1666 with  FIRE ... For the Devil has not yet had his due   666 is the number of the Beast, this the year foretold when Christ will return. To slay the Devil. To bring the New Jerusalem. A gang of fanatics \u2013 the Saints - choose to hasten that prophesied day. They will kidnap, rape, murder. Above all, they will kill a king. For in the renegade Captain Blood they have the perfect assassin.   Two men - the highwayman William Coke and the thief-taker Pitman - are recruited to stop them. Both fall victim to the Saint's foul plots. All seems lost...   Yet in the early hours of September 2nd, 1666, something starts that will overtake them all \u2013 fanatics, princes, soldiers and fops, actresses and holy murderers. For the year of the Beast is three quarters done and the Devil has not yet had his due.   London's a tinder box. Politically, sexually, religiously. Literally. And it is about to burn.   '...in amongst all the breathless adventure and dangerous acts. Humphreys offers up an absorbing and well-wrought blend of heroism and villainy in a story that is ultimately about the danger of unchecked fanaticism and the capacity of bravery to overcome. Plus \u2014 it's a lot of fun.'   - Toronto Star   'The brilliance of Fire is that while the villains and their motives are known, the rest of the plot is slowly revealed in an engrossing thriller that shifts from a riverside theatre to the cramped confines of a 17th-century warship and finally to the congested parishes of London.'   - Macleans   For the Jack Absolute novels:   'C.C. Humphreys has created the finest series of historical novels since Patrick O'Brian.'   - The Good Book Guide UK. "

An absolute riot' Tom Mead, author of The Murder Wheel A gripping new mystery featuring Detective Tess Fox and her con-artist sister Sarah Jacobs. Members of the Lewes Bonfire Society would say afterwards that the event would have been a huge success that year, if it hadn't been for the dead body... When the charred remains of MP Rupert Millington are found inside a burning effigy, no one knows how they got there, but there are plenty of rumours about whodunnit.

Whispers filter beneath her bedroom door. Tamar learns that Ruth has been kicked out of her assisted living home, and other facilities refuse to house her and endanger their own residents. Tamar has spent years suppressing her childhood trauma, but it comes rushing back with each strange event in her home. As Tamar copes with their disturbing past, which her mother stubbornly refuses to admit to, she can\u2019t shake the feeling that there\u2019s something worse than her mother lurking in the shadows. Perfect for fans of  The Haunting of Hill House,  this terrifying novel unravels one dark strand at a time. "

There's a pinch of Ray Bradbury, a soup\u00e7on of Stephen King, a dash of fairy tale logic, but Dan Kois makes something entirely his own out of this familiar and always pleasurable territory.\"\u2014Kelly Link, author of The Book of Love    \"Like Stand by Me mixed with Stranger Things and The Twilight Zone, Hampton Heights is a rollicking chronicle of youth set loose among mystery and monsters. Dan Kois deftly conjures a boundless world that's chilling, wondrous, and delightful.\"\u2014Adam Sternbergh, author of The Eden Test    From the author of the Washington Post notable novel Vintage Contemporaries, something completely unexpected: a hair-raising and rollicking adventure set on one night in 1987, when six paperboys must confront a slew of monsters as well as their own personal demons in a haunted Midwestern neighborhood.   On a cold winter's evening in 1987, six middle-school paperboys wander an unfamiliar Milwaukee neighborhood, selling newspaper subscriptions, fueled by their manager Kevin's promises of cash bonuses and dinner at Burger King. But the freaks come out at night in Hampton Heights. Sent out into the neighborhood in pairs, the boys will encounter a host of primordial monsters\u2014and triumph over them.  Sigmone, who is bussed to a white school, is stuck with Joel, a white kid who idolizes Black culture. Mark, who's wrestling with his sexuality, joins his secret crush, Ryan. Nishu and Al are outsiders; one is a second-generation immigrant, the other a poor kid in a rich school. Over the course of one eventful evening, the three pairs will encounter the wild things of Hampton Heights\u2014werewolves, witches with a centuries-old story to tell, and a creepy, ancient monster who feeds on memories. Meanwhile, Kevin is having an adventure of his own, seducing a beautiful woman in the neighborhood's tavern . . . but who is actually in control?  Funny, thrilling, outrageous, and sneakily beautiful, Dan Kois's Hampton Heights captures without sentimentality the dreams and fears of teenage boys in a tender horror-comedy about camaraderie, bravery, vulnerability, and the terrifying prospect of growing up.

When a 2,000-year-old mummy is unearthed in central China, investigators from all over the world fly in to Washington, DC, for a top secret meeting, hoping to find an answer to its mysterious genetic anomalies.  But the scientists may have mistakenly released a new, deadly disease of extraterrestrial origins in the process of examining the genetic markers of the ancient mummy. The devastating human error causes a worldwide plague\u2014one that penetrates the barriers of the human immune system. Sino expert Eric Logan and archaeologist Dr. Marcia Kessler lead an expedition back to the icy glaciers of China to extract a much older 20,000-year-old mummy, which could help them formulate a cure. Even as they embark on their mission, the strange illness afflicts the people around them, turning men into mindless monsters.  The team retreats to a remote Buddhist monastery and must hold off a vicious army of victims. As they wrestle with the possibility that they may be the last living humans on earth, someone finds an ancient burial object that may hold the key to ending the apocalyptic epidemic . . .

                "A tightly plotted page-turner ripped from the headlines of history, as three very different women must work together to stop a killer and save the truest home they've ever known.  Before hypnotism, there was Mesmerism. And in 1894 Minneapolis, in the wake of a national financial crisis, spiritualism of every stripe is all the rage, and women are dying under mysterious circumstances. But until a new guest lands at the Bethany Home for Unwed Mothers, refusing to speak or explain her arrival, the sordid stories of unexplained deaths seem unconnected. Faith\u2019s reticence is quickly interpreted as malevolence, setting the house abuzz with whispers of dark magic. Abby, a staunch Quaker, lifelong supporter of progressive causes, and the Bethany Home\u2019s treasurer, thinks the rumors of mystical powers swirling around Faith are nonsense, but she recognizes the danger of a good story. Unwilling to allow the Home\u2019s important mission to be clouded by scandal, Abby tasks Faith\u2019s roommate, May, with tracing Faith\u2019s path to the Bethany Home. May is desperate to end her year at Bethany Home engaged and on track to her happily-ever-after\u2014even if her prince charming is Hal, a man she\u2019s not sure she can trust. She uncovers a Minneapolis she never expected as she begins digging into Faith\u2019s shadowy background, and her investigation brings her closer to polite society and Hal than she could have dreamed. The more May learns, the more she\u2019s forced to question the motives of everyone around her, including Abby and Faith, and as more women turn up dead, May must reevaluate the future she wants, and which lies she\u2019s willing to tell, for whom. Rich with tension, suspicion, and sharply observed characters, Caroline Woods reimagines a classic American genre through the eyes of three bold, unforgettable women. "

With the success of the Hulu series  11/22/63  starring James Franco and the highly anticipated  The Dark Tower  movie release, Stephen King's brand is stronger than ever. This collection, nominated for a Locus Award, is guaranteed to keep readers awake long after bedtime, and features an introduction and prefatory notes to each novella by the author. \"Stephen King is a master storyteller, and you will never forget these stories,\" raves the  Seattle Times  about  Four Past Midnight .     One Past Midnight : \"The Langoliers\" takes a red-eye flight from LA to Boston into a most unfriendly sky. Only eleven passengers survive, but landing in an eerily empty world makes them wish they hadn't. Something's waiting for them, you see.     Two Past Midnight : \"Secret Window, Secret Garden\" enters the suddenly strange life of writer Mort Rainey, recently divorced, depressed, and alone on the shore of Tashmore Lake. Alone, that is, until a figure named John Shooter arrives, pointing an accusing finger.     Three Past Midnight : \"The Library Policeman\" is set in Junction City, Iowa, an unlikely place for evil to be hiding. But for small businessman Sam Peebles, who thinks he may be losing his mind, another enemy is hiding there as well\u2014the truth. If he can find it in time, he might stand a chance.     Four Past Midnight : \"The Sun Dog,\" a menacing black dog, appears in every Polaroid picture that fifteen-year-old Kevin Delevan takes with his new camera, beckoning him to the supernatural. Old Pop Merrill, Castle Rock's sharpest trader, aims to exploit The Sun Dog for profit, but this creature that shouldn't exist at all, is a very dangerous investment. "

Get ready to meet the most hideous menace ever to terrorize the town of Castle Rock, Maine.  Outside a peaceful town in central Maine, a monster is waiting. Cujo is a two-hundred-pound Saint Bernard, the best friend Brett Camber has ever had. One day, Cujo chases a rabbit into a cave inhabited by sick bats and emerges as something new altogether.   Meanwhile, Vic and Donna Trenton, and their young son Tad, move to Maine. They are seeking peace and quiet, but life in this small town is not what it seems. As Tad tries to fend off the terror that comes to him at night from his bedroom closet, and as Vic and Donna face their own nightmare of a marriage on the rocks, there is no way they can know that a monster, infinitely sinister, waits in the daylight.   What happens to Cujo, how he becomes a horrifying vortex inescapably drawing in all the people around him, makes for one of the most heart-stopping novels Stephen King has ever written. \"A genuine page-turner that grabs you and holds you and won't let go\" ( Chattanooga Times ),  Cujo  will forever change how you view man's best friend.

But getting out is not easy as it would seem...  Located off a desolate stretch of Interstate 50, Desperation, Nevada, has few connections with the rest of the world. It is a place, though, where the seams between worlds are thin. And it is a place where several travelers are abducted by Collie Entragian, the maniacal police officer of Desperation. Entragian uses various ploys for the abductions, from an arrest for drug possession to \"rescuing\" a family from a nonexistent gunman. There's something very wrong here, all right, and Entragian is only the surface of it.   The secrets embedded in Desperation's landscape, and the evil that infects the town like some viral hot zone, are both awesome and terrifying. But as one of the travelers, young David Carver, seems to know\u2014though it scares him nearly to death to realize it\u2014so are the forces summoned to combat them. \"Stephen King's knack for turning the stray junk of pop culture into sick, darkly engrossing thrills has rarely been this much in evidence as in  Desperation \" ( Salon ).

Stegs is no ordinary cop. Something of a maverick, he has in the past played the role of a criminal just a little too well. Now suspended from duty, and with his close friend killed in the shoot-out, he determines to go at it alone.  DI John Gallan and his partner Tina Boyd are part of the subsequent investigation that will take them to the heart of one of London's most notorious criminal gangs. What they cannot know is that they've also embarked on a journey that will lead one of them straight into the rifle sights of the enemy. "

                "From the best-selling author of  The Dog Stars,  a novel about two men\u2014friends since boyhood\u2014who emerge from the woods of rural Maine to a dystopian country racked by bewildering violence  Every year,\u00a0Jess and Storey have made an annual pilgrimage to the most remote corners of the country, where they camp, hunt, and hike, leaving much from their long friendship unspoken. Although the state of Maine has convulsed all summer with secession mania\u2014a mania that has simultaneously spread across other states\u2014Jess and Storey figure it\u2019s a fight reserved for legislators or, worst-case scenario, folks in the capital. But after weeks hunting off the grid, the men reach a small town and are shocked by what they find: a bridge blown apart, buildings burned to the ground, and bombed-out cars abandoned on the road. Trying to make sense of the sudden destruction all around them, they set their sights on finding their way home, dragging a wagon across bumpy dirt roads, scavenging from boats left in lakes, and dodging armed men\u2014secessionists or U.S. military, they cannot tell\u2014as they seek a path to safety. Then, a startling discovery drastically alters their path and the stakes of their escape. Drenched in the beauty of the natural world and attuned to the specific cadences of male friendship, even here at the edge of doom, Burn is both a blistering warning about a divided country\u2019s political strife and an ode to the salvation found in our chosen families.

                "A group of employees and their CEO, celebrating the sale of their remarkable emotion-mapping-AI-algorithm, crash onto a not-quite-deserted tropical island.  Luckily, those who survived have found a beautiful, fully-stocked private palace, with all the latest technological updates (though one without connection to the outside world). The house, however, has more secrets than anyone might have guessed, and a much darker reason for having been built and left behind. Kristen, the hyper-competent \"chief emotional manager\" (a position created by her eccentric, boyish billionaire boss, Sumter) is trying to keep her colleagues stable throughout this new challenge, but staying sane seems to be as much of a challenge as staying alive.  Being a woman in tech has always meant having to be smarter than anyone expects\u2014and Kristen's knack for out-of-the-box problem-solving and quick thinking has gotten her to the top of her field. But will a killer instinct be enough to survive the island?  A gleefully decadent near future whodunit from Madeline Ashby, the acclaimed futurist and author of  Company Town \u2014perfect for fans of  Severance ,  The White Lotus , and  Black Mirror .  At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied. "

Her most important letter might be her last...     Years ago Alex Marks escaped to New York City for a fresh start. Now, aside from trips to her regular diner for coffee, she keeps to herself, gets her perfectly normal copywriting job done, and doesn't date. Her carefully cultivated world is upended when her childhood hero, Francis Keen, is brutally murdered.

Against all odds, Alex is given the position and quickly proves herself skilled at solving other people's problems. But soon, she begins to receive strange, potentially threatening letters at the office. Francis's murderer was never identified, turning everyone around her into a threat. Including her boss, editor-in-chief Howard Dimitri, who has a habit of staying late at the office and drinking too much.   As Alex is drawn into the details surrounding her predecessor's murder, her own dark secrets begin to rise to the surface and Alex suddenly finds herself trapped in a dangerous and potentially deadly game of cat and mouse that takes her all the way from the power centers of Manhattan to Francis Keen's summer house, where her body was found and where the killer may just be waiting for her.

                "\"This novel is as chilling as it is poignant. My advice? Read it with the lights on.\" \u2014\u00a0Megan Collins, author of The Family Plot   Three sisters. Three keys. Three unspeakable horrors.  The Finch sisters once spent long, hot summers exploring the dozens of abandoned properties littering their dying town\u2014until they found an impossible home with an endless hall of doors...and three keys left waiting for them. Curious, fearless, they stepped inside their chosen rooms, and experienced horrors they never dared speak of again.  Now, years later, youngest sister Claire has been discovered dead in that old, desiccated house. Haunted by their sister's suicide and the memories of a past they've struggled to forget, Meg and Esther find themselves at bitter odds. As they navigate the tensions of their brittle relationship, they draw unsettling lines between Claire's death, their own haunted memories, and a long-ago loss no one in their family has ever been able to face. With the house once again pulling them ever-closer, Meg and Esther must find the connection between their sister's death and the shadow that has chased them across the years...before the darkness claims them, too.   As emotional as it is haunting, Through the Midnight Door explores the sometimes-fragile bonds of sisterhood and the way deeply rooted trauma can pass from generation to generation.    \"A gorgeously realized, deeply affecting horror story about sisterhood, secrets, and all the things that can haunt someone.\"\u2014\u00a0Layne Fargo, author of They Never Learn.

While working on a powerful new weapon for England, the country's first secret agent John Dee finds himself threatened from all sides. First, his secret plans are stolen, then his son is kidnapped by a vengeful enemy from his past. At the same time, Dee's wife, Jane, is sent by Queen Elizabeth I to console her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom court advisors are determined to try for treason.   But Jane suspects her assignment is much more than a visit from a sympathetic cousin. Is it possible that Elizabeth sent her to speed Mary to her death without the public trial that she knows will forever define the limits of royal power? Together, John and Jane begin to feel genuine sympathy for the Scottish queen and work to finish his invention, protect their son, and save Mary from the scaffold. But can they do that while still remaining loyal to the English crown?. "

He hasn't seen or heard from the local nurse since their first date went disastrously wrong. But when Wiley walks in on a bank robbery with Linette as one of the hostages, his training and protective instincts kick into full gear. A heroic bullet to his armor-protected chest is enough for Linette to forgive Wiley's past mistakes and be willing to begin anew.

Normally content in her solitude, she's fixated on defeating a deadly enemy in her lab, and now she's the one being hunted. There's only one solution, according to the pack, and that's for her to mate Erik Volk and bring him into the fold.    Erik Volk has been fascinated by the petite wolf shifter from the moment he'd kidnapped her so she could help his family, which she cheerfully did. He's dedicated to his job as the Enforcer for his brother's pack, but the Alpha in him keeps yanking against the chains. When Luna falls into danger, he has no choice but to let the Alpha loose and become the Shifter they all should fear.   **First published in Kindle Vella**. "

                "\"Fireworks explode down the shore in Rip Tide, Colleen McKeegan's absorbing novel. At once an insightful look at tangled family dynamics and a wrenching story of youthful delusion, Rip Tide illustrates that for many women, the past is a ticking time bomb. The deeper we bury it, the bigger the boom. Spread out a blanket, crack open Rip Tide and prepare to be dazzled.\"\u2014Jillian Medoff, author of When We Were Bright and Beautiful    From the author of The Wild One, a heartfelt and suspenseful novel about two sisters returning to their childhood beachfront home who are forced to confront their traumatic past when a body washes ashore.   It's been fifteen years since Kimmy Devine promised herself she'd never move back to Rocky Cape, the idyllic South Jersey beach town where she grew up. She doesn't want to relive the crushing heartbreak and scandal that ravaged her world as a teen. Her younger sister Erin shares those feelings, the wounds she caused so many years ago forever binding her and Kimmy.  Yet here they are, back in their hometown: Kimmy, floundering after quitting her high-powered finance job in London to help her dad run the family's hardware stores; Erin, reeling from fertility issues and an ongoing divorce, begging to be taken seriously by her parents. The more time they spend in Rocky Cape, the stronger the pull of nostalgia, and both Erin and Kimmy slip on the past like a pair of last year's sandals, forgetting about the blisters when worn too long.  As the sisters celebrate their homecoming at their parents' yacht club, a handful of familiar faces arrive to dampen the revelry. The next morning, a body is found floating nearby and long-buried secrets from their adolescence begin to emerge. Someone from the sisters' past, it seems, is out for revenge.  Told in fast-paced, dual timelines, Rip Tide is a steamy, tension-filled tale of suspense about family, friendships broken and repaired, young love lost and rekindled, forgiveness and second chances, taking control of your life, and the dangerous decisions we make when blinded by desire.

Losing yourself inside of a book can be dangerous. Not everyone finds their way out.  Agnes Corey, a junior editor at a small independent publisher, has been hired by enigmatic author Veronica St. Clair to transcribe the sequel to her 1993 hit phenomenon, The Secret of Wyldcliffe Heights. St. Clair has been a recluse since the publication of the Jane Eyre-esque book, which coincided with a terrible fire that blinded and scarred her. Arriving in the Hudson Valley at St. Clair's crumbling estate, which was once a psychiatric hospital for \"wayward women,\" Agnes is eager to ensure St. Clair's devoted fans will get the sequel they've been anticipating for the past thirty years.  As St. Clair dictates, Agnes realizes there are clues in the story that reveal the true\u2014and terrifying\u2014events three decades ago that inspired the original novel. The line between fact and fiction becomes increasingly blurred, and Agnes discovers terrible secrets about an unresolved murder from long ago, which have startling connections to her own life. As St. Clair's twisting tale infiltrates Agnes's psyche, Agnes begins to question her own sanity\u2014and safety. In order to save herself, Agnes must uncover what really happened to St. Clair, and in doing so, set free the stories of all the women victimized by Wyldcliffe Heights. "

The latest thrilling instalment in the legendary  New York Times  bestselling series from the world of Robert Ludlum.  It's been over a decade since Nash Rollins recruited a brilliant, talented, but disaffected young man named David Webb to join Treadstone. Webb became the agent known as Cain - and later took on the identity of Jason Bourne. That violent winter - which included Cain's first mission for Treadstone - was also a story of betrayal in ways that David never knew. So after the injury that erased Bourne's whole life, Nash lied about the circumstances of David's recruitment to Treadstone. He was afraid that learning the truth might drive Bourne out of the agency forever. But now, when Bourne meets a woman who recognises him as David Webb, the secrets of those days begin to come out - and Bourne is forced to confront the dangerous ghosts of a past he doesn't even remember.

When Maddy Wight is hired to ghostwrite the memoir of world-renowned cosmetic surgeon Angela Reynolds, she jumps at the chance to get her career back on track. But the deeper she digs, the more elusive the doctor becomes.  Confined to Angela's glass-walled house in the Scottish Highlands, Maddy can't shake the unsettling feeling of being watched. As a result, she is drawn ever closer to Angela's enigmatic business partner Scott, whose mercurial moods change as quickly as the darkening moors outside.  Returning to London once the book is finished, Maddy is excited for their future together. But news of Scott's death shatters the celebrations at the book's launch party. Which is why, months later and still grieving, she is blindsided to see Scott entering a tube station just in front of her. And before she knows it, she is following him.

To wire the planet within the all-encompassing and all-knowing system of artificial intelligence, known as \"The Goo.\" It's hard to remember a time before The Goo . . . and even harder to imagine a future without it. The advanced AI system anticipates humanity's wants, needs, and desires, and seems to have an unfailing omniscience. But when Rowe, the leader of the crew, discovers mysterious secrets buried beneath the surface of this unknown planet, his faith in AI begins to wane. One unsettling twist after another turns Rowe's mission into a quest for answers and a terrifying fight for survival.  Scott Kenemore's inimitable style incorporates elements of horror and satire,  making Edge of the Wire  a chilling triumph of the science fiction genre and also a rollicking send-up of today's tech culture. With ripped-from-the-headlines concerns about a \"wired future\" brought bracingly to life, this novel delivers an entertaining yet harrowing look at the existential crisis of the moment\u2014humanity's increasing dependence on artificial intelligence.

                "In this gripping and intensely atmospheric debut, disquiet descends on a small town after the suspicious death of a beautiful young doctor, with all clues pointing to the reclusive young man who abandoned the community in chase of big city dreams but returned for the first love he left behind. Perfect for fans of  All Good People Here  and  Where the Crawdads Sing .   One peaceful morning, in the small, Puget Sound town of Point Orchards, the lifeless body of Dr. Erin Landry is found hanging from a tree on the property of prodigal son and failed writer, Elijah Leith. Sheriff Jim Godbout's initial investigation points to an obvious suicide, but upon closer inspection, there seem to be clues of foul play when he discovers that the circumstances of the beautiful doctor's death were ripped straight from the pages of Elijah Leith's own novel.   Out of money and motivation, thirty-three-year-old Elijah returns to his empty childhood home to lick the wounds of his futile writing career. Hungry for purpose, he throws himself into restoring the ramshackle cabin his father left behind and rekindling his relationship with Nakita, the extraordinary girl from the nearby reservation whom he betrayed but was never able to forget.   As the town of Point Orchards turns against him, Elijah must fight for his innocence against an unexpected foe who is close and cunning enough to flawlessly frame him for murder in this scintillating literary thriller that seeks to uncover a case of love, loss, and revenge.

A young boy peddles pirated books; his sister, two infants by her side, offers wilted flowers to unwilling customers; an old ice-cream vendor looks forward to some extra earnings under the hot sun; at a cafe nearby, a bunch of students celebrates a graduation; a group of mechanics prepares for afternoon prayers on the pavement; local shopkeepers play loud bhajans to announce a feast for the needy; a police van idles by the roadside; a young woman in a luxury car grows impatient with her clients and their demands; and traffic that has come to a standstill slowly begins to start up ...   Then, in the blink of an eye, everything changes.  As the street descends into a vortex of vengeance and retribution, the unfolding events make victims and perpetrators, observers and participants, of them all.  Searing, intense and superbly crafted, Inside Burn explores the anatomy of a spontaneous riot, exposing the absurdity of intolerance and celebrating, in the end, the core of the human spirit. "

                "In this high-stakes thriller by three-time Edgar Award winner and    New York Times    bestselling author T. Jefferson Parker, (\"A marvel...hits the high-water mark for crime fiction every time out.\" \u2014Gregg Hurwitz), a big wave surfer and her sons compete in the same contest that killed her husband many years before.  Jen Stonebreaker hasn't entered into a big-wave surfing competition since witnessing her husband's tragic death twenty-five years ago at the Monsters of the Mavericks. Now, Jen is ready to tackle those same Monsters with her twin sons Casey and Brock, who have become competitive surfers in a perilous sport. When he's not riding waves, modeling for surfing magazines, or posting viral content for his many fans, Casey Stonebreaker spends his days helping with the family restaurant \u2014 catching fish in the morning and bartending at night. Casey's love for the ocean and his willingness to expose illegal poachers on his platforms puts him on a collision course with a crime syndicate eager to destroy anyone threatening their business. Outspoken Brock Stonebreaker couldn't be more different from his twin. The founder of Breath of Life, a church and rescue mission that assists with natural disasters that no one else will touch, Brock has lived an adventurous and sometimes violent life. Not everyone appreciates the work that Brock's Breath of Life mission accomplishes, and threats to destroy his mission\u2014and his family\u2014swirl around him. As the big-wave contest draws closer, a huge, late fall swell is headed toward the Pacific coastline. Jen's fears gnaw at her \u2014 fear for herself, for her sons, for what this competition will mean for the rest of her life. At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied. "

Things haven't been going well for Beth. Her husband has left her for one of her friends. Her fellow school mums judge her for swearing too much and not shifting the baby weight. And now she's stuck in A&E after her son fell off the climbing wall on the first day of school. In fact, things haven't been going well for Beth since Charlotte died - her best friend, a favourite at the school pick-ups and the only person to ever run an interesting PTA meeting. But after being hit by a car while on an ill-timed evening jog, Charlotte is no longer there to help Beth pick up the pieces of her increasingly difficult life. That is, until Beth discovers that Charlotte left her toddler alone in the house during that fatal run. The Charlotte she knew would never do something so irresponsible, and suddenly Beth is questioning whether Charlotte's death was really an accident. With a newfound purpose and a glass of wine in hand, it's time for Beth to uncover what really happened to her best friend. And what better place to start than the circle of chatty school mums, who can't be as perfect as they pretend. But which of them is hiding something? Beth's determined to find out.
