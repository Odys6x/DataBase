The discourse on public space as understood in the democratic-rationalist tradition, when applied to the Singaporean public space, would offer much criticism but would not be adequate in identifying alternative processes that allow for transformative potentials in public space. Thus said, the objectives of this book are: 1. To develop a conceptual frame of reference to construct the discourse on Singapore public space 2. To form a preliminary model of Singapore public space through analyzing case studies 3. To understand the modes, methods of production and representation of these public spaces within the rapidly changing urban context 4. To situate these constructions of public space and its possible trajectories within the larger discourse on public space, and to examine the viability of such a construction and interpretive model of public space.

                "In \"The Tobacco Atlas\", full-colour maps and graphics illustrate in a clear and accessible format a wide range of tobacco issues, revealing similarities and differences between countries, and exposing the behaviour of the tobacco companies. It also examines solutions and predicts the future course of the epidemic.; The atlas attempts to illustrate that tobacco is not just a simple health issue, but involves economics, big business, politics, trade, litigation, deceit and crimes such as smuggling. It also demonstrates the importance of a multifaceted approach to reducing the epidemic by WHO, other UN agencies, NGOs and the private sector. "

Nowadays, BIM models let us integrate multiple quantitative parameters that can agile the information to interchange between stakeholders. Using this potential to standardize protocols of interventions and share knowledge is necessary to face a high scale intervention that our cities need. Climatic Emergency and socioeconomic crisis caused by recent events \u2014COVID-19 and hydrocarbons crisis\u2014 are the two principal struggles we face as society. European Politics, embodied by National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) developed by each region give the way to the green transition of different productive sectors.     Our building stock is responsible for approximately 36% of the CO2 emissions in the European Union. For this reason, these policies focus a large part of their efforts on economically incentivizing a new development model for the building sector that is committed to the large-scale renovation of the existing real estate stock and that, through the reduction of energy demand and of emissions, manage to reduce the environmental impact of these.       Next Generation EU is the new recovery instrument that aims to mobilize investments towards strategic sectors for the reorientation of the production model that, among other measures, contributes to decarbonization through the promotion of energy efficiency and the deployment of renewable energies.

Largely forgotten for centuries, the ancient Maya were incredible. Their cities across Central and South America featured astonishing pyramids and palaces, while they were also successful farmers and highly creative artists. The Maya were the first people in the Americas to learn how to read and write, and they invented things like rubber, chocolate and chewing gum. They had a deep understanding of astronomy, mathematics and timekeeping, though they also had some horrible, bloodthirsty traditions such as making human sacrifices. Find out what life as an Ancient Maya was actually like while also investigating why this mysterious civilisation was close to dying out when the region was conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century.

Paired with delightful, kid-friendly illustrations, this early middle grade memoir invites readers to join Jin and her family in the outskirts of Inner Mongolia to remind us that though we all have different customs and traditions, we are more alike than not, and that mischief lives within all of us.

A hundred years ago there were 250,000 Gaelic speakers. Now there are 80,000. This book answers four broad questions: What has been the geography of Gaelic in the past? How has that geography changed over time and space? What have been the patterns of language use within the Gaedhealtachd in the past? And what have been the processes of language change? Emphasis is upon the changing geography of the spoken language from 1698 to 1981: from the earliest date for which it is possible to document the expanse of the Gaelic language area to the most recent census to record the numbers speaking Gaelic.

Focusing on the post-2010 period, the book shows how China's central government programs and reforms (\"upgrading from above\") are coupled with a wide variety of local government policies, firm strategies, and domestic economy shifts (\"upgrading from below\") that link China's top-down programs into industrial growth on the ground. Placing China's current development push within a global value chain (GVC) context shows how Chinese development strategies and the global economy remain intertwined. This volume brings together international GVC experts and China-based researchers who have carried out detailed fieldwork and industry specific quantitative analyses of GVCs and development with important implications for policymakers in both developed and developing economies.

Drawing on evidence from several disciplines, it chronicles how cattle raiders were created, pursued, and controlled, and how modern scholarship strives to reconstruct pasts of disruption and deviance. Through a series of vignettes, Rachel King uses excavated material, rock art, archival texts, and object collections to explore different facets of how disorderly figures were shaped through impressions of places and material culture as much as actual transgression. Addressing themes from mobility to wilderness, historiography to violence, resistance to development, King details the world that raiders made over the last two centuries in southern Africa while also critiquing scholars' tools for describing this world. Offering inter-disciplinary perspectives on the past in Africa's southernmost mountains, this book grapples with conceptsrelevant to those interested in rule-breakers and rule-makers, both in Africa and the wider world.

Using leading theories of authoritarian institutions, it discusses China's approach to the internet and methods of implementation in terms of party-state institutions and policy processes. This provides a much-needed 'inside out' perspective on digital authoritarianism that avoids the perception of China as some coherent and static monolith.\u00a0\u00a0The study also offers a powerful rationale for China's cyber sovereignty as an externalisation of its domestic internet governance framework and broader political-economic context. As China shifts from rule-taker to rule-maker in world politics, the Chinese Dream (zhongguo meng) is now going global. Beijing's digital authoritarian toolkit is being promoted and exported to other authoritarian regimes, making China a major driver of digital repression at the global level. "

Unlike the '45, the uprising which culminated in the brutal battle of Sheriffmuir was very much a Scottish affair, fought without either French troops or assistance, and unashamedly aimed at reversing the hated Union with England and re-asserting Scotland's independence.However, in this lively new study by acclaimed military historian Stuart Reid, a completely fresh look is taken at the campaign, while the battle is reassessed in the light of a thorough knowledge of the ground and the armies which fought there.

                "How do Chinas mobile individuals create a sense of home in a rapidly changing world?   Unhomely life, different from houselessness, refers to a fluctuating condition between losing home feelings and the search for home \u2014 a prevalent condition in post-Mao China. The faster that Chinese society modernizes, the less individuals feel at home, and the more they yearn for a sense of home. This is the central paradox that Xiaobo Su explores: how mobile individuals\u2014lifestyle migrants and retreat tourists from China's big cities, displaced natives and rural migrants in peripheral China\u2014handle the loss of home and try to experience a homely way of life.  In  Unhomely Life,  Xiaobo Su examines the subjective experiences of mobile individuals to better understand why they experience the loss of home feelings and how they search for home. Integrating extensive empirical data and a robust theoretical framework, the author presents a journey-based critical analysis of \"home\" under constant making, un-making, and re-making in post-Mao China. Su argues that the making of home is not a solely economic or rational calculation for maximum return, but rather a synthesis of resistance and compromise under the disappointing conditions of modernity.  Offering rich insights into the continuity and disruption of China's great transformation,  Unhomely Life:   Develops an original theory of unhomely life that incorporates contemporary research and traditional Chinese ideas of home   Explores the process of homemaking and its implications for understanding the costs of high-speed economic growth in China   Analyzes mobile individuals across different genders, ages, ethnicities, social classes, and economic backgrounds to address the balance between meaning and money in everyday life   Containing in-depth and sophisticated empirical data collected from 2002 to 2020,  Unhomely Life: Modernity, Mobilities, and the Making of Home in China  is an invaluable resource for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, lecturers, and academic researchers in cultural studies, migration, tourism, China studies, cultural anthropology, sociology, and social and cultural geography.

                "MAPPING PARTITION    \"A hugely productive partnership between geography and history, 'Mapping Partition' does a great service to the field of Partition studies - it leaves us in no doubt about both the long-term cartographical processes that contributed to how South Asia was divided in 1947, and the importance of bringing a geographer's insights to bear on this complex history of boundary making.\"    Professor Sarah Ansari,   Professor of History (South Asia), Royal Holloway University of London    \"Fitzpatrick produces spatial readings of partition's knowledge formations, geopolitical imaginaries, administrative cartography, and legal geographical expertise. These enrich the histories and geographies of partition through painstaking archival, textual, and visual analysis which will resonate far beyond historical geography and South Asian studies.\"    Professor Stephen Legg,   Professor of Historical Geography, University of Nottingham     Mapping Partition  delivers the first in-depth geographical account of the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. The book explores the impact of colonial geography and geographers on the boundary, both during the partition process and in the period preceding it.  Drawing on extensive archival research, Hannah Fitzpatrick argues that colonial geographical knowledge underpinned the partition process in heretofore unacknowledged ways. The author also discusses the consequences of placing different ethnic, communal, and linguistic groups onto the colonial map and the growing importance of majority and minority populations in representative democratic politics.   Mapping Partition: Politics, Territory and the End of Empire in India and Pakistan  is required reading for students and researchers studying geography, colonial and imperial history, South Asian studies, and interdisciplinary border studies.

                "Until now, you've only heard one side of the story, but Chinese American history extends far beyond the railroads. Here's the  true  story of America, from the Chinese American perspective.   A Junior Library Guild Gold Standard Selection  If you've learned about the history of Chinese people in America, it was probably about their work on the railroads in the 1800s. But more likely, you may not have learned about it at all. This may make it feel like Chinese immigration is a newer part of this country, but some scholars believe the first immigrant arrived from China 499 CE\u2014one thousand years before Columbus did!\u00a0 When immigration picked up in the mid-1800s, efforts to ban immigrants from China began swiftly. But hope, strength, and community allowed the Chinese population in America to flourish. From the gold rush and railroads to entrepreneurs, animators, and movie stars, this is the true story of the Chinese American experience. "

                "Discover a world of creativity and tradition in this fascinating picture book that explores the history and cultural significance of the color blue.  From a critically acclaimed author and an award-winning illustrator comes a vivid, gorgeous book for readers of all ages.       NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR   \u2022  New York Public Library  \u2022   Chicago Public Library  \u2022   Kirkus Reviews     For centuries, blue powders and dyes were some of the most sought-after materials in the world. Ancient Afghan painters ground mass quantities of sapphire rocks to use for their paints, while snails were harvested in Eurasia for the tiny amounts of blue that their bodies would release. \u00a0 And then there was indigo, which was so valuable that American plantations grew it as a cash crop on the backs of African slaves. It wasn't until 1905, when Adolf von Baeyer created a chemical blue dye, that blue could be used for anything and everything\u2014most notably that uniform of workers everywhere, blue jeans. Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond's\u00a0riveting text combined with stunning illustrations from Caldecott Honor Artist Daniel Minter, this vibrant and fascinating picture book follows one color's journey through time and across the world, as it becomes the blue we know today.

                "This book discusses the strategies that will define China's overseas expansion in the coming years. China is spending billions of dollars acquiring overseas companies and assets, from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to the Hinkley Point nuclear station. Will this corporate buying binge continue? In this book, Collier argues that state control will occur only among certain strategically key acquisitions while many of the corporate acquisitions will be done by smaller, private firms. However, China's rising debt load may restrict the ability of many firms to obtain capital, including from China's shadow banking sector. A key to understanding China's strategy is to look at how the state intervenes in private business. Collier ably brings clarity to the \"gray area\" between state and private economic activity in this complex landscape. As the West faces China's growing investments abroad, this book will be required reading for executives and decision makers, journalists, and policy makers. "

                "The authoritative and illuminating biography of T. E. Lawrence - the man who inspired the iconic film  Lawrence of Arabia -  from \"The World's Greatest Living Explorer\" Ranulph Fiennes. Thomas Edward Lawrence first set foot on the hot sands of Arabia in 1909.   By 1918 there was a \u00a320,000 price on his head.  His journey to this point has long been legend. From his first postings as archaeologist, liaison and map officer, to fighting alongside guerrilla forces during the Arab Revolt. Journeying more than 300 miles through blistering heat to capture Aqaba, to his involvement in peace conferences that decided the future of the Middle East. Lawrence gave over his life the Middle East and its people. A legend in his own lifetime, Lawrence's epic story has always been ripe for the retelling - but Ranulph Fiennes is no ordinary biographer . . . Having led Arab troops into battle on the Arabian peninsula in a war fought only fifty years later. Fiennes too discovered the wonders of these far-flung lands and the people who live there, and is one of very few who can claim a true insight into the kind of life that Lawrence lived - bold and adventurous to the end. With detailed access to records and an in-depth knowledge,  Lawrence of Arabia  is at long last a true and full account of this mysterious adventurer who captivated the world.  'Corking, rip-roaring, crisply written, full of extraordinary characters.

One hundred years ago, one of the most popular spectator sports was bicycle racing, and the man to beat was Marshall \"Major\" Taylor, who set records in his teens and won his first world championship by age twenty. The first African American world champion in cycling and the second Black athlete to win a world championship in any sport, Major Taylor faced down challenge after challenge, not least the grueling Six-Day Race, a test of speed, strength, and endurance. With energy, heart, and pounding verse, Charles R. Smith Jr. evokes the excitement of the crowd at Madison Square Garden as Major powered through exhaustion, hallucinations, and racist abuse from fellow riders, who tried to crash his bike throughout the competition. Leo Espinosa's dynamic illustrations capture the action, and as day six draws to a close, and Major's odds narrow, there is little doubt that his triumphant rise and legacy as an international cycling champion are assured\u2014whatever the outcome of one race\u2014in this high-octane tribute to a trailblazing athlete.

Are you loyal like the Dog? Or stubborn like the Ox? What does the time you were born say about who you are? Can knowing more about your Zodiac empower you in your day to day?\u00a0  A Kid's Guide to the Chinese Zodiac \u00a0offers the history and lore behind this ancient classification system, along with practical advice for young readers on how to navigate relationships and apply oneself at school and at home, all based on the qualities associated with the twelve Zodiac animals. Someone born in the year of the Pig might prioritize stability and comfort. Naturally agreeable, they may need to work at recognizing when they're uncomfortable and speak up so they don't get stuck in the mud. Someone who is a Rat, on the other hand, might be ambitious and clever, but may need to take a step back from their own ideas every now and then in order to find balance.\u00a0  Beautifully illustrated, with sidebars on Chinese culture and myth throughout, this book is an informative and mystical guide for any kid who is curious about the universe and how they fit into it.

                "Imperial Island    shows how empire and its ever-present aftermath have divided and defined Britain over the last seventy years.   'Masterful ... you won't look at Britain in the same way ever again'  OWEN JONES After the Second World War, Britain's overseas empire disintegrated. As white settlers from Rhodesia returned home to a country they barely recognised, Commonwealth citizens from Asia and the Caribbean migrated to a motherland that often refused to recognise them. Race riots erupted in Liverpool and Notting Hill even as communities lived and loved across the colour line. In the 1950s and 60s, imperial violence came home too, pervading the policing of immigrant communities, including their sex lives. In the decade that followed, a surge of support for the far-right inspired an invigorated anti-racist movement. These tensions, and the imperial mindset that birthed them, have dominated Britain's relationship with itself and the world ever since: from the simplistic moral equation of Band Aid to the invasion of Iraq, in the tragedy of Stephen Lawrence and the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics, we see how Britain's contradictory relationship with its past has undermined its self-image as a multicultural nation.  Imperial Island  tells a story of immigration and fractured identity, of social strife and communal solidarity, of people on the move and of a people wrestling with their past. It is the story that best explains Britain today.  'An eye-opening study of the empire within ' SHASHI THAROOR  'Clear, bold, refreshing'  LUCY WORSLEY. "

Since the regiment's creation in 1899, the men of the 65th have proudly served the US through multiple wars, despite facing racial discrimination. Their courage, loyalty, and patriotism earned them hundreds of accolades, including the Congressional Gold Medal in 2014.   But the honor and fidelity of the men of the 65th came into question in 1952, in the midst of the Korean War, when ninety-one Borinqueneers were arrested and tried for desertion and disobeying orders. How could this happen in one of the most distinguished and decorated units of the Army?   In this telling of one of the forgotten stories of the Korean War, author Talia Aikens-Nu\u00f1ez guides us through the history of the Borinqueneers and the challenges they faced leading up to what was the largest court martial in the entire war. Rediscover the bravery of the men of the 65th through Aikens-Nu\u00f1ez's thorough writing and the soldiers' firsthand accounts of the Korean War. "

                "Featuring the previously unpublished diary of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sobral, Under-Lieutenant of the Argentine Navy, this book provides insight on his life and his participation in Otto Nordenskj\u00f6ld's Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901-1903.  This biography highlights Sobral's personal thoughts on the mission, his position, the science being discovered, and the geopolitical situation around him. The reader also learns about the state of science, Antarctic exploration, and cultural-political-issues at that time.\u00a0  The author's critical and contextual analysis of the diary explains more about Sobral and his role in Argentina, Antarctica, science and history. This paints a detailed picture of Sobral as an individual, and provides the framework to depict the world in which Sobral lived and worked as well as his expedition and accomplishments. The book aims to explain the context of Sobral's writings, the significance of the events he described in his diary entries, and the way all of these events tied into history and scientific discovery.
