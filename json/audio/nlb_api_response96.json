Vikings of the Ice captures the blood, guts, sweat and toil of the swilin' life aboard one of the most famous wooden walls of all. The Terra Nova carried Scott to the Antarctic in 1910.

                "This is the gripping true account of the worst disaster in the history of Mt. Everest. On May 10, 1996, two commercial expeditions headed by experienced leaders attempted to climb the highest mountain in the world&#8212;but things went terribly wrong. Crowded conditions on the mountain, miscommunications, unexplainable delays, poor leadership, bad decisions, and a blinding storm conspired to kill. Twenty-three men and women, disoriented and out of oxygen, struggled to find their way down the side of the mountain. In the dark, battered by snow and driven by hurricane-force winds, some of the climbers became hopelessly lost and resigned themselves to death. But head climbing guide Anatoli Boukreev refused to give up hope. Climbing blind in the maw of a life-threatening storm, Boukreev brought climbers back from the edge of certain death. This is an amazing true story of an expedition fated for disaster, of the blind ambition that drives people to attempt such dangerous ventures, and of a modern-day hero, who risked his own life to save others.

                "Two of the nation's most respected sports journalists team up for a vital, hard-hitting investigation into the tumultuous state of big-time college football.    We are living in the Wild West of college sports. Name, Image and Likeness endorsements, the transfer portal, collectives, conference realignment, the powerful influence of media companies have all rendered the notion of amateur athletics a quaint relic of the past, replaced by a Brave New World where money and self-interest rule.  The Price is a sweeping, in-depth, thought-provoking look at an inflection point in big-time college football. Six time New York Times bestselling author Armen Keteyian and award-winning national college football reporter John Talty conducted more than two hundred wide-ranging interviews with head coaches, athletic directors, conference commissioners, administrators, politicians, power brokers, agents and media executives from one corner of the sport to the other. They reveal never-before-reported details on major players such as Nick Saban, Jim Harbaugh, Kirby Smart, Jimbo Fisher, and Lane Kiffin. Keteyian and Talty's reporting also lays bare the machinations that destroyed the historic conference that was the Pac-12, purely in the name of greed.  As the sport's premier coaches race for the exits, Keteyian and Talty reveal deep, dark truths about a beloved game under siege\u2014and the financial, physical, emotional and psychological toll taken on everyone whose dreams and fortunes often depend on the final score on a Saturday afternoon.

Intrigue, high-stakes machinations and adrenaline-fuelled track action \u2013  Growing Wings  is the never-before-told inside story of how the grid's most fascinating, swagger-rich and win-at-all-costs team competed their way to total domination and disrupted Formula One's world order. With exclusive access to Red Bull's inner sanctum, leading F1 writer Ben Hunt probes the operations of a world-beating Formula One team over its eventful twenty-year history, from the rivalries, turbulence and controversy, to the game-changing tech and the leadership strategies. He also talks to the drivers themselves, including Webber and Vettel, for a fascinating insight into the mindset of motorsport athletes through success, risk and challenge. Endorsed with a foreword by Team Principal Christian Horner, but maintaining journalistic independence, this is a thrilling, frank and unvarnished account of how the paddock's loudest upstarts achieved team alchemy with the promotion of a driver called Max Verstappen, and what it means to go, learn, go again, tweak, test, and ultimately outplay the competition in a way never before seen in Formula One. \u00a92024 Ben Hunt (P)2024 Penguin Audio.

I will risk my life in order to save it.\u201d  Growing up in the mountains of Utah, Cory Richards was constantly surrounded by the outdoors. His father, a high school teacher and a ski patroller, spent years teaching Richards and his brother how to ski, climb, mountaineer, and survive in the wild. Despite a seemingly idyllic childhood, the Richards home was fraught with violence, grief, and mental illness. After being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and dropping out of high school, Richards subsumed himself in the worlds of photography and climbing, seeking out the farthest reaches of the world to escape the darkness. Then, in the midst of a wildly successful career in adventure photography, a catastrophic avalanche changed everything, forcing Richards to confront the trauma of his past, evaluate his own mental health, and learn to rewrite his story.  The Color of Everything  is a thrilling tale of risk and adventure, written by a man who has done it all: He\u2019s stood at the top of the world, climbed imposing mountain faces alone in the dark, and become the only American to summit an 8,000-meter peak in winter. But it is also the story of a tumultuous life\u2014a stirring, lyrical memoir that captures the profound musings of an unquiet mind grappling with the meaning of success, the cost of fame and addiction, and whether it is possible to outrun your demons. With exquisite prose and disarming candor, Richards excavates the roots of his trauma and shares what it took for him to climb out of it. "

Emily's mom had taken up running in her late forties; she ran her first marathon at fifty. She even went skydiving to celebrate her sixtieth birthday. Emily, already an accomplished ultrarunner, decided to try to break the record for the Fastest Known Time by a woman on the Pacific Crest Trail's 460 miles across Oregon.  To the Gorge  takes the listener through her seven days, nineteen hours, and twenty-three minutes on the trail, covering nearly sixty miles a day on foot over rugged terrain, and battling all the issues that could arise during such a monstrous undertaking. All the while, she simultaneously struggles with how to get through the profound grief of losing her mom. Interwoven with Halnon's eight-day effort are her remembrances from her mother's life and death, exploring the complicated experience of grief\u2014and what shines through it. Filled with adventure and heart,  To the Gorge  invites listeners to consider what our greatest losses can teach us about how to live the one life we get. "

                "\" Alpine Rising  is a fascinating history of the crucial and frequently tragic role of local Nepalis, Tibetans, and Pakistanis on mountaineering expeditions to the world's highest peaks.\" \u2014Jon Krakauer  The name of Maurice Herzog, the first man to reach the summit of Annapurna, is widely recognized, but how many know Ang Tharkay, the Sherpa who carried the seriously frostbitten Herzog on his back for miles? Although rarely mentioned in published accounts of early expeditions, local climbers have long been significant members of first ascents on the world's tallest and most challenging peaks. In  Alpine Rising , award-winning writer Bernadette McDonald sets the record straight by shining a light on these too often forgotten heroes. Now, in the twenty-first century, it is often local climbers who are setting records. A Nepali team was the first to climb K2 in winter; they reached the summit while singing their national anthem. Pakistani climbers like Little Karim and Ali Sadpara devoted their lives to helping others survive and succeed on and off the mountains and their stories deserve to be more widely known. Not only a timely reminder of the need to recognize the contributions of local climbers and the importance of correcting the historical record,  Alpine Rising  is a celebration of a region's local heroes.

                "From bad weather to business travel, to traffic safety, there are dozens of reasons why cyclists and triathletes take their rides inside. Although indoor cycling workouts offer the ultimate control over workout conditions, most inside riders don't get the most out of their trainers or spin bikes.    Ride Inside  offers cyclists and triathletes a smart guide to getting more fitness from every indoor cycling workout. From the world's most experienced personal cycling coach, Joe Friel,  Ride Inside  reveals all the unique aspects of indoor riding: Mental aspects like motivation, focus, and enjoyment  Changes in upper body stability, posture, and pedaling technique on a stationary bike  Respiration, hydration, and cooling  Inherent changes in power output  Lower leg tension and eccentric loading from flywheel momentum  Lower effort from lack of terrain changes, headwinds, and crosswinds  Road-like feel  Different shifting patterns  All these differences of indoor riding add up to a big impact when the rubber hits the road.  Drawing from the foundations of Friel's classic training guides,  The Cyclist's Training Bible   and  The Triathlete's Training Bible ,  Ride Inside  shows how to apply smart and proven training concepts to indoor cycling. Riders will get expert guidance on the best ways to set up a trainer or smart trainer, how to modify outdoor workouts for indoor cycling, how to better monitor power and RPE, and how to use social online training platforms like Zwift to make training better and not worse.   Most critically,  Ride Inside  shows cyclists and triathletes how to do indoor cycling workouts that actually meet their training goals instead of compromising. This audio edition is narrated by Brian Arens, a listener favorite.   Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont. \u00a92020 Joe Friel and Jim Rutberg (P) "

                "By recounting the untold story of the most influential sports campaign in British newspaper history, which turned concussion in professional rugby from a niche issue into front and back page news, Concussed poses the questions all sports lovers need answering as evidence grows linking sports-related concussions to premature deaths and dementia. Written by Sam Peters, the journalist who spearheaded the Mail on Sunday's Cudlipp Prize nominated concussion campaign, Concussed reveals one man's attempts to blow the whistle on a mounting head injury crisis. For years, his efforts saw him labelled a 'pariah' and almost forced him out of the sport he loved for good. Including exclusive interviews with bereaved families whose stories have never been told before, as well as high-profile administrators, medics, current and past players, coaches, lawyers and media figures, Peters recounts the countless battles he fought and the threats he faced in a sport whose macho culture masked the urgent need to radically overhaul player welfare standards. Expanding his research from rugby to football, NFL and cricket, Peters brings an unparalleled breadth of experience and depth of knowledge to a subject he has written about and campaigned over for almost a decade. Now sport's 'dirty secret' is out in the open, Peters asks what it must now do to ensure future generations of players are not left permanently damaged and how parents can be persuaded their children are safe to play contact sports. Ultimately, in an increasingly risk-averse world, Concussed: Sport's Ticking Timebomb asks: will concussion kill sport?. "

                "An award-winning journalist tells the inspiring story of her unlikely midlife journey to master the daunting sport of obstacle course racing\u2014a powerful, science-based account of the change possible at any age when we push limits.   \u201cThis story of personal transformation is thrilling.\u201d\u2014Gretchen Rubin, #1  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Happiness Project  and  Life in Five Senses   In her midforties, Gwendolyn Bounds attended a dinner party where someone asked a little girl: \u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d  It struck Bounds: In middle age,  no one  asks you that anymore. So she put the question to herself. The answer set her on an unexpected five-year path of transformation from an unathletic office executive glued to her screens to an age-group medalist and world championship competitor in obstacle course racing\u2014a demanding military-style sport requiring speed, endurance, mobility, and strength.\u00a0  In  Not Too Late,  Bounds explores how tackling something new and hard upended her expectations for middle age\u2014while also helping her reconcile regrets of her youth. Her story takes us from playgrounds and gyms, where Bounds relearns childhood movements (swinging from monkey bars, climbing a rope); to far-flung Spartan Race courses, where she strives to master running in difficult terrain and to conquer challenges such as scaling tall walls, crawling under barbed wire, and carrying heavy loads of rocks up mountains.\u00a0  Bounds\u2019s journey offers inspiration and a road map for anyone craving more out of life. Woven through  Not Too Late  are insights from scientists, longevity doctors, philosophers, elite athletes, and performance experts on how to reimagine our limits and who we think we are. Through Bounds\u2019s story, as she changes her body and mindset, we learn about humans\u2019 capacity to tap inner reserves, face fears, locate intrinsic motivation, and push boundaries at any life stage. Ultimately, one message prevails: When unleashing our full potential, age can be a secret weapon. "

And then, a bout with depression led him back home to haul them out of the unfinished storage. It was what the doctor had ordered. In addition to medication and therapy, Drew needed to exercise. Exercise was not something he did. But golf? Sure, why not? As Drew fumbled his way through his first round in years, he discovered that sucking at golf was his new calling, one that helped him find a sense of balance and rhythm-both on the course and in his own mind. Drew's connection to the game inspired him to write this book, and his passion is infectious. Combining great storytelling with fascinating historical tidbits and moving personal insights, he writes about everything from how golf taught him to be a better listener, son, and friend, to how to slow down, appreciate what he has, and keep fighting the good fight. Along the way, he demystifies the customs, history, and rules of the game. Brimming with personality, accessibility, and a freewheeling spirit, How Golf Can Save Your Life is a celebration of the sport and an examination of all it offers. "

Wahl was beloved for good reason\u2014he was kind, generous, and unflinching in the face of injustice. He was also one of the best sports journalists of his generation. Spanning four decades of storytelling,  World Class  collects for the first time the finest writing of Grant Wahl, from op-eds for his college newspaper to twenty-five years of reporting at  Sports Illustrated  to his deeply personal work for  F\u00fatbol with Grant Wahl  on Substack. Wahl was the multi-tool modern sportswriter: clear and direct; able to write long, short, or in between; cosmopolitan; socially aware. Arranged thematically,  World Class  demonstrates how Wahl\u2019s career aligned with the evolution of sportswriting.\u00a0Included are explorations of soccer subcultures from Buenos Aires and F.C. Barcelona to the dusty sandlots of Nacogdoches, Texas, as well as accounts of trophy lifts that have a first-draft-of-history definitiveness. Some pieces capture prodigies early in their careers, like LeBron James and Landon Donovan; others lift the voices of the women athletes to whom Wahl paid early attention\u2014stars like Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe. The book showcases the daring and important positions Wahl took in Qatar in the weeks before he died, supporting migrant workers and LGBTQ+ people. More than a collection of Grant Wahl's best work,  World Class  is a portrait of a journalist at the height of his powers, always evolving with the times, revealed by the stories he found and the unflinching way he told them.

Meulensteen's story begins in a provincial region of Holland; a student of the game, Ren\u00e9 explains how he fought through red tape and bureaucracy to establish himself as a coach with principles he firmly believed in, and how those visionary methods saw him land a remarkable position at the world's biggest club, overseeing the technical development of their most precious department - the youth system. Meulensteen talks about working with stars like Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs, before he was called to work with the first team on a more permanent basis. There, he enjoyed notable contributions, transforming Cristiano Ronaldo into a goal monster and featuring heavily in the move that brought Robin van Persie to Old Trafford. From being Ferguson's right-hand man to going out on his own, Meulensteen explains his philosophy in an inspiring and accessible way. Moreover, this autobiography is a compelling and addictive love-letter to the fabric of everything Manchester United stands for. The exploration and explanation of United's style of play will thrill supporters and stun analysts, as one of the sport's greatest minds finally shares his fascinating journey in football. "

                "Baseball has always been a symbol as much as a sport. With a blend of individual confrontation and team play, a luxurious pace, and an immaculate urban parkland setting, it offers a sunny rendering of the American Dream, both the hard work that underpins it and the rewards it promises. Film, America's other national pastime, which magnifies and mythologizes all it touches, has long been the ideal medium to canonize this aspirational idea. Baseball: The Movie is the first definitive history of this film genre that was born in 1915 and remains artistically and culturally vital more than a century later. Writer and critic Noah Gittell sheds light on well-known classics and overlooked gems, exploring how baseball cinema creates a stage upon which the American ideal is born, performed, and repeatedly redefined. Traversing history and mythmaking, cynicism and nostalgia, this thoroughly researched book takes listeners on a multifaceted tour of baseball on film. "

What began as a gameday ritual replete with misspelled player names and scrawled symbols turned into an obsession with scoring every game he watched, one which persisted as Roberts rose through the ranks at WFAN. Taken together, those scorebooks form a living, breathing Mets diary spanning 30 years of thrilling\u2014and, at times, tortured\u2014fandom.My Mets Bible is an exercise in memory and nostalgia, and a meditation on the things that stick with us as sports fans.

Meticulously kept history mixes with personal recollections and behind-thescenes anecdotes covering touchstone events such as Johan Santana's no-hitter, Robin Ventura's grand slam \"single,\" and the loss that Roberts has never quite gotten over.

Every few years a talent comes along that disrupts everything we think we know about how the NBA should work.

Masterfully connecting NBA past and present through incisive writing and stunning visual statistical analyses, he shows how we've come to this unprecedented moment, a time when offensive efficiency and shooting percentages are higher than ever.  Using beautifully designed, four-color shot maps and illustrations, Goldsberry offers a graphic journey through the last thirty years of the NBA that covers up to the 2023 season and is as much fun to look at as it is to read. The end result offers stories and analyses of a select group of NBA superstars that open up lively debates, reveal just how singular their talents truly are, and characterize the dramatic 21st-century metamorphosis of the best basketball league in the world.

                "Swift, brutal, and utterly final: with knockouts, there are no grey areas; a KO is a KO. But what actually is a knockout, and why are we so fascinated by it?   The Knockout  is the most dramatic and devastating moment in sport. There is nothing to rival it: Not the last second goal, not the basket on the buzzer, not the putt that drops on the eighteenth green. In terms of its brutality and finality, it stands alone. It's a bolt of lightning; fascinating and frightening; a shot of pure adrenaline that only the very rarest moments can provide. This book examines  what it's like for the people at the center of that storm .  How does it feel to land that ultimate blow? How does it feel to suffer it? We assess the impact it has on the fighters and the people close to it and ask what it takes mentally, physically, and emotionally for a person to enter into an arena where  the stakes are so unimaginably high . Agony and ecstasy, triumph and disaster, hope and despair, self-belief and doubt,  The Knockout  embraces it all.  Part macro, part micro exploration, the narrative will move across the physical, psychological, social, and even philosophical aspects of the knockout. With insights from renowned commentators, as well as fighters, their coaches, doctors and family members, this is a complete look at  the finishing blow that brings any match to a sudden close , and the repercussions that follow.  Featuring  extensive coverage of Froch vs Groves , the infamous match that saw Carl Froch knock out George Groves in the ninth round and gain a controversial win over the super-middleweight champion.  The Knockout  goes  deeper into the phenomenon than ever seen before  and explores the idea of male vulnerability and the delicate nature of many boxers, particularly pronounced once they have experienced a knockout.

                "Waite \"Schoolboy\" Hoyt's improbable baseball journey began when the 1915 New York Giants signed him as a high school junior, for no pay and a five-dollar bonus. Based on a trove of Hoyt's writings and interview transcripts, Tim Manners has reanimated the baseball legend's untold story, entirely in Hoyt's own words. Over his twenty-three-year professional baseball career, Hoyt won 237 big league games across 3,845 2/3 innings-and one locker room brawl with Babe Ruth. He writes at length about the art of pitching and how the game and its players changed-and didn't-over his lifetime. After retiring from baseball at thirty-eight and coming to terms with his alcoholism, Hoyt found some happiness as a family man and a beloved, pioneering Cincinnati Reds radio sportscaster with a Websterian vocabulary spiked with a Brooklyn accent. When Hoyt died in 1984 his foremost legacy may have been as a raconteur who punctuated his life story with awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping anecdotes. In Schoolboy he never flinches from an unsparing account of his remarkable and paradoxical eighty-four-year odyssey. "

                "America's most sought-after voice in the fight to save female sports shares her unbelievable story and inspires readers to embrace common sense and truth in discussions about women's rights.    Riley Gaines has been called many things: Collegiate athlete. All-American. Champion. But in 2022, everything changed. The narrative shifted. Now, critics smeared her as: Transphobic. Narrow-minded. Evil.    What changed? Riley gave the truth a voice. She stood up, spoke out, and dared to ask questions \u2014 not just for herself, but for all female athletes who refuse to accept an ideology where \"inclusivity\" for trans-identifying male athletes now means treating women unfairly.    Riley Gaines is changing minds in the process, and this highly anticipated, fearless, pro-woman book takes on controversial but critical questions we must confront about women (and sports) in America. Can't we embrace policies that give everyone the chance to compete but still protect women and ensure they have a fair shot at success?    In this book, Riley scrutinizes the perspectives of athletes on the opposing side of this debate, deconstructing their arguments with science, facts, and logic. She also asks what has happened to free speech and dissent in this country, where it now seems nearly impossible to have a well-reasoned debate. And in telling her story, Riley reveals what's at stake if the truth-seekers remain silent about the injustices women face from radical agendas. "

                "The definitive biography of Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw, examining the genesis of his brilliance, his epic quest to win the World Series, and his singular place within the evolving baseball landscape\u2014based on exclusive interviews with Kershaw and more than 200 others.\u200b   More than any baseball player of his generation, Clayton Kershaw has embodied the burden of athletic greatness, the prizes and perils that await those who strive for it all. He is a three-time Cy Young award winner, the first pitcher to win National League MVP since Bob Gibson, and a surefire, first-ballot Hall of Famer. Many of his peers consider him the greatest pitcher to ever climb atop a big-league mound.    In an age when baseball became more impersonal, a sport altered by adherence to algorithms and actuarial tables, Kershaw personified the game's lingering humanity, with his joy and suffering on display each October as he chased a championship. He pitched through pain, placing his future at risk on the game's grandest stages. He endeared himself to teammates and foes alike with his refusal to make excuses, with his willingness to shoulder the blame when he failed. And he only further impressed them when he returned, year after year, even as his body broke down from the strain of his profession. The journey captivated fans in Los Angeles and beyond, so much so that when the Dodgers finally won a title in 2020, the baseball world exulted in his triumph.    The Last of His Kind  traces Kershaw's path from a boyhood fractured by divorce to his development as one of the most-heralded pitching prospects in Texas history to his emergence in Los Angeles as the spiritual heir to Sandy Koufax. But the book also charts Kershaw's place in baseball's changing landscape, as his own stubbornness butted against the game's evolution. The story of baseball in the 21st century can be told through Kershaw's career, from his apprenticeship with icons like Joe Torre and Greg Maddux, to his wary relationship with the implementation of analytics, to his victimhood in the 2017 sign-stealing scandal at the hands of the Houston Astros. The game has changed so much during Kershaw's illustrious career. To understand how baseball is played today, and how it got that way, you must understand the journey of Clayton Kershaw. "

                "The Gas and Flame Men is the first full account of Major League ballplayers who served in the Chemical Warfare Service during World War I. Four players, two club executives, and a manager served in the small and hastily formed branch, six of them as gas officers. Remarkably, five of the seven-Christy Mathewson, Branch Rickey, Ty Cobb, George Sisler, and Eppa \"Jeptha\" Rixey-are now enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, New York. The son of a sixth Hall of Famer, player and manager Ned Hanlon, was a young officer killed in action in France with the First Gas Regiment. Prominent chemical soldiers also included veteran Major League catcher and future manager George \"Gabby\" Street and Boston Braves president and former Harvard football coach Percy D. Haughton. The Gas and Flame Men explores how these famous baseball men, along with an eclectic mix of polo players, collegiate baseball and football stars, professors, architects, and prominent social figures all came together in the Chemical Warfare Service. Jim Leeke examines their service and its long-term effects on their physical and mental health-and on Major League Baseball and the world of sports. The Gas and Flame Men also addresses historical inaccuracies and misperceptions surrounding Christy Mathewson's early death from tuberculosis, long attributed to wartime gas exposure. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin.  This audio edition features an exclusive Q&A with Jordan.  Captain, father, leader, a fearless ambassador for the causes he believes in and a world-class midfielder, Jordan Henderson is all of these things - and it is why he is one of the most widely respected players of his generation. His story will go down in legend but his story also carries an inspirational message for anyone, showing hurdles and barriers won't stop you reaching your goals. In this, his first autobiography, Jordan reveals how an early love for the game as a kid became an all-consuming passion growing up in Sunderland and the moments and role models that encouraged him to follow his dream to play for his home club. Transferred to Liverpool in June 2011, Jordan's early years at the club saw him struggle to settle under Sir Kenny Dalglish then Brendan Rodgers before eventually establishing himself at Anfield as a force of nature in midfield. In June 2015, Jordan took the reins from Steven Gerrard. Under his captaincy, Liverpool have won six trophies headed by the Champions League and the Premier League, bringing the club its first league title in 30 years. In this book, Jordan charts his decade-long journey with the Reds - he is one of only five men to play ten season for the club in the modern era - as well as his incredible experiences within the England squad. He is the only player in history to have been named England Player of the Year at both under-21 and senior level. Full of heartache, excitement and triumph, this is a candid insight into the life of a top-flight footballer as you've never heard before. \u00a9 Jordan Henderson 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022. "

On 30 November 1872, England took on Scotland at Hamilton Crescent in Glasgow, a match that is regarded as the first international fixture. More than 5,000 fans watched the two sides play out a 0-0 draw. It was the first of more than a thousand games played by the side, and the beginning of a national love affair that unites the country in a way that few other events can match.  In Hayward's brilliant new biography of the team, based on interviews with dozens of past and present players and coaches, including  Viv Anderson, Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer  and current coach  Gareth Southgate , we get a vivid portrait of all aspects of the team's story, reliving highlights such as the  World Cup victory  in 1966 and the time when football came home in Euro 96, as well as the low points when the players were obliged to give the Nazi salute in 1938 and the era when England's hooligan fans brought shame on the nation. From  Stanley Matthews and Bobby Moore  through to more modern heroes such as  Paul Gascoigne, David Beckham, Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane , Hayward brings a large cast of characters to life.  For anyone who wants to understand England football, and why it means so much to so many,  England Football: The Biography  is an essential and vital read. "

                "A memoir of homecoming\u2014Heidi Across America is a gritty story of how opening our hearts to others enables us to open our hearts to ourselves and love what we find there. In the summer of 2010, Heidi Beierle had just finished her first year of graduate studies in community and regional planning and decided to pedal her bicycle solo from her home on the west coast across rural America to the Preserving the Historic Road conference in Washington, D.C. What started as a research trip turned into an intimately physical and psychological encounter with self and nationhood. Heidi was 35 at the time and didn't love much about herself except her ability to endure grueling physical undertakings. She viewed her journey as an opportunity to fix her failures and insufficiencies. There were also some research questions she wanted to explore: Why do people live in small towns and what do they like about it? Did a bicyclist like herself bring economic benefit to the small towns she visited? What could communities do to support or invite cyclists to stay in their towns? What could cyclists do to support the communities? Along the way, she was surprised by the kindness of strangers and the emotional pinch of traveling through Wyoming where she grew up. Her journey led her through the Plains and into the Ozarks where the heat climbed to agonizing temperatures and every pedal stroke in the heat felt one closer to death. By the time she completed the trip, Heidi discovered a newfound compassion for herself and a growing love for her country. Strangers opened their hearts to her and in turn, she opened her heart to herself. And her questions began to change and mirror things many Americans are asking themselves today: How can I be okay in my own skin? What does it mean to be enough? How do I satisfy my desire to travel without harming the planet? What does it mean to love America? For many young people, it is a rite of passage to light out on an adventure to see the world and expose themselves to new experiences, but we don't often talk about how Americans seeing America can open us to the diversity, awe, and wonder available right here in our nation. Heidi Across America offers a journey to self-love, empathy, consideration for others, and respect for the spirit of place as pathways to find connection and home. "

Justin Davis viewed this culture as something he was lucky enough to experience. After all, he'd won a Memorial Cup after leading the tournament in scoring, and he'd been drafted by the Washington Capitals. \"In my mind,\" he says, \"I was the normal one.\" Unfortunately, after stepping outside the game, he began to recognize the racism, sexual abuse and bullying that was so deeply ingrained in the sport. And then, as his own children grew into teenagers, the curtain was pulled back, the memories came rushing forward, and he was horrified: \"Why was I naked in a bus bathroom for four hours with seven teammates? What happened to my brain, and why can't I remember the simplest things? How did I end up living in a basement where the strangers upstairs were clearly engaged in domestic abuse?\"   As it navigates the sport's darkest corridors,  Conflicted Scars  shares the story of the common Canadian player and offers a guide for parents who need to know how and why a typical teenager with NHL dreams, from a small town, now lives anxiously, introvertedly, and battling emotional detachment.

To limit travel time while he trained for the Olympics an hour and a half away from home, he lived out of a crusty, old construction van, parked anywhere he could find a spot.  And in 2022, after seventeen years of failure\u2014all the crashes, injuries, and personal setbacks\u2014he won Olympic gold at forty years old, becoming the oldest Olympic snowboard medalist in history.  In this candid and affable memoir, Baumgartner details his journey from a one-stoplight town to the podium in Beijing. Tales of crisscrossing the globe on the racing circuit and competing in four Olympic Games sit comfortably alongside Baumgartner's reflections as a single parent and his affectionate portrayal of Iron River, Michigan, the community that raised him.   More than just a sports story, Gold from Iron is a tale of massive dreams, constant sacrifice, and the lessons that can be learned racing down an ice-covered course on a carbon fiber board. "

                "From NFL player Steve Gleason, a powerful, inspiring memoir of love, heartbreak, resilience, family, and remarkable triumph in the face of ALS \u201cSteve Gleason has changed the world.\u201d \u2013Roger Goodell, NFL Commissioner \u2022 \"An extraordinary book... A Life Impossible  will change the way people cope, think, and live.\" \u2013Mike Lupica, co-author with James Patterson of  12 Months to Live    In 2011, three years after leaving the NFL, Steve Gleason was diagnosed with ALS,\u00a0a terminal disease that takes away the ability to move, talk, and breathe. Doctors gave him three years to live. He was\u00a0thirty-three years old. As Steve says, he is now ten years past his expiration date. His memoir is the chronicle of a remarkable life, one filled with optimism and joy, despite the trauma and pain and despair he has experienced. Writing using eye-tracking technology, Gleason covers his pre-ALS life through the highs and lows of his NFL career with the New Orleans Saints, where he made one of the most memorable plays in Saints history, leading to a victory in the first post-Katrina home game,\u00a0uplifting the city, making him a hero, and reflected in a nine-foot bronze statue outside the Superdome. Then came his heartbreaking diagnosis. Gleason lost all muscle function,\u00a0he now uses Stephen Hawking-like technology to communicate, and breathes with the help of a ventilator. This book captures Gleason and his wife Michel\u2019s unmatched resilience as they reinvent their lives, refuse to succumb to despair, and face his disease realistically and existentially. This unsparing portrait argues that a person's true strength does not reside solely in one\u2019s body but also in the ability to face\u00a0unfathomable adversity\u00a0and still be able to love and treasure life.

                "Professional distance runners Elvin Kibet and Shadrack Kipchirchir grew up in rural Kenyan villages. Though their lives began in poverty, both were driven to reach their full potential, to gain an education, and make a difference. And they would find their way to do just that through the high-pressure world of distance running. In All in Stride, Johanna Garton tells the gripping and inspiring stories of Elvin and Shadrack. Beginning with their upbringing in Kenya, Garton follows the runners through their journeys to the United States, their running for Division One universities, their blossoming romance as college students, and ultimately their service as U.S. soldiers and professional runners. Woven through the narrative is the story of Samantha Schultz, who also competed for the U.S. Army. Like Elvin and Shadrack, she struggled with several obstacles throughout her journey, including poor coaching, over training, and disordered eating, a condition that plagues so many young female athletes. More than just a running story, All in Stride takes listeners behind the scenes to explore the difficulties Elvin and Shadrack faced, including adjusting to an entirely new culture in the U.S., bigotry and intolerance, the stresses and joys of global competitions, the thrill of being a part of the race to break the two-hour marathon, joining the U.S. Army's World Class Athlete Program, and discovering the ever-changing landscape of what it means to be an American.

                "What if everything you know about pain is wrong? For starters, pain is not synonymous with being \"injured.\" It's also not evidence that your biomechanics are \"flawed\" or your body is \"imbalanced.\" And most important, pain doesn't always mean you have to see a doctor. In Pain Performance, Ryan Whited and Matt Fitzgerald present a radically new way for athletes to understand and manage pain that exposes the shocking lack of evidence for modern medicine's approach to pain and injury management. Based on many years of research and a greater appreciation of the complexity of pain as a lived experience, Whited's revolutionary \"Training as Treatment\" method puts you in control of your pain experience as you build mental and physical resilience. Learning this simple, three-step process will start you on a path to better performance and a more fulfilling athletic journey with less downtime, fewer visits to clinicians, less anxiety about pain and injury, and less time and money wasted on treatments that don't work. An elite boulderer and son of a chronically injured professional horse jockey, Whited brings a pragmatic approach to a complex process. As a trainer, he has spent decades guiding athletes from breakdowns to breakthroughs at Paragon Athletics, a magnet for pain-affected runners, climbers, and recreational athletes who've grown frustrated with the medical system. Pain Performance makes Whited's unparalleled knowledge of pain science and physiology available to anyone seeking to stay out of the doctor's office and on track toward their goals. \"Training as Treatment is a fresh and innovative approach to understanding and working with pain rather than against it. By helping athletes face fear and reframe pain, Ryan Whited facilitates a shift in mindset that fosters a healthy, lifelong relationship to sport and performance.\"\u2014Rob Krar, coach and ultrarunning champion This audiobook contains a supplemental PDF with a Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and a link to video demonstrations of exercises to get started on a Training as Treatment plan.

                "The author of the instant fishing classic  The Optimist  wades into deeper waters and shares new wisdom, humor, and experience in seven extraordinary fly-fishing expeditions that mark one year in his journey through the middle part of life when worldly demands increase even as fishing continues to beckon\u2014and must be pursued.  In David Coggins's previous book,  The Optimist , he tackles the techniques of fly fishing and meditates on its virtues, recounting his triumphs and frustrations. Now, in  The Believer , he deftly mixes travel, local cultures, further fishing challenges (some knee-buckling in their disappointment), and details his own experience as life and love crowd his time to fish. Self-consciously\u2014and self-deprecatingly\u2014Coggins embarks on seven far-flung fishing voyages, away from screens and social media, not answering his phone, reveling in humanity's undying yearning for a quest, for the rituals and rites of passage that mark transition. For David, these journeys not only showcase his skill as an angler\u2014including to Norway, Scotland, Spain, Cuba, and Argentina, as well as road trips to Wyoming, Tennessee, and the Catskills\u2014they also signal the end of his fly-fishing youth. But that doesn't mean that David will sell all his rods and hang up his hat; rather, that his relationship with his fly-fishing obsession will evolve. And he's okay with that\u2014 mostly , especially if he can catch an elusive salmon or a ferociously strong tarpon or the mysterious and almost invisible bonefish.    The Believer  is a humble, humorous call for the journey that is part of the destination, where the search for greater self-awareness leads to patience, observation, and endurance. And, since this is fly fishing, after all\u2014there's always the possibility of abject failure and leaping, glorious reward.   Wry, entertaining, thoughtful, and relatable,  The Believer  will hook both anglers and non-anglers alike. "

                "George Harrison met Muhammad Ali in 1964, when both men were on the cusp of worldwide fame. We Shook Up the World is the story of these two larger-than-life figures at a momentous time. A unique blend of biography and cultural history, this book goes to the very heart of the zeitgeist that each man inhabited and reinvented in profound and enduring ways. In 1974, deep in the Pennsylvania woods, thirty-two-year-old Muhammad Ali was seeking renewal, training to regain his heavyweight boxing title in a fight with George Foreman, and exploring questions about his politics, his career, and his life. Meanwhile, George Harrison was thirty-one years old. With the Beatles disbanded, his marriage ending, and the loss of his mother still fresh, he traveled to India to revitalize his faith, energy, and musical spirit, seeking renewal at the Hindu holy city of Varanasi. In contemplating how these two complex figures managed to carry the cultural rebelliousness and spiritual yearning of the 1960s into a new era of cataclysmic political, economic, and social change, We Shook Up the World offers an intimate perspective on two outsize figures in the nation's and the world's cultural history, and a new understanding of their unique contributions to the consciousness of their time and ours.

From reporting pitchside on the biggest matches to his iconic appearances in EA's FIFA series, Geoff's warmth, humour and expertise have made him a constant fixture of the sport. In this audio edition of  Cheers Geoff! , read by the author himself, Geoff shares hilarious, bizarre and moving stories from across his incredible career. This audio edition includes a foreword from Alan Shearer.   'Cracking read . . . loved it' - Piers Morgan   'Packed with brilliant anecdotes about the biggest names' -  The Mirror   There are just a handful of people who have been ever-present for the thirty years of the Premier League, but only one person has been at the very epicentre for the entire period: Geoff Shreeves.

Rewind to 1971, and Sue Barker's coach is sending his 15-year-old tennis prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to a junior championship in France, alone, with a one-way ticket, telling her she'd have to win the money to pay for her return fare. Sue hides in the grounds of the hosting tennis club overnight, to avoid paying for a hotel. The next day, she walks onto court and smashes it. Five years later, and she's Britain's No 1. The same combination of grit, grace and talent took her to the top of live Sports TV. And now, after four decades on camera encouraging other legends to share their stories, she is telling her own. Going all in for her once-only autobiography, Sue takes us inside the showbizzy world of 70s and early 80s tennis, dating the stars, hitting the headlines. She reveals the battles she fought for hard-won success in two careers, gives us a ringside seat on the nation's biggest sporting dramas, and a fascinating insider's understanding of competitors under pressure. This is the remarkable life story of a tennis champion, an award-winning broadcaster who has brought sporting history into our living rooms for decades, and a trail-blazing woman who has always called the shots. \u00a9 Sue Barker 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022.

Thirty years (and counting!) after publication,  To the Linksland  still enthralls readers who pick it up for the first time\u2014or return to the book for the sheer pleasure of it. In 1991, Michael Bamberger, a newspaper sportswriter, gave up his apartment, took a leave of absence from his job and his life, and, joined by his newlywed wife, set off to explore the wide world of golf. Bamberger's first step in this madcap golfing adventure was to become a caddie on the European golf tour, where he encountered the game's most dynamic players up close and personal, including golf's greatest artist, Seve Ballesteros. Crisscrossing the Continent with his bride, Bamberger caddied for a true original, Peter Teravainen, a Yale-educated golfer with a workingman's spirit and a knack for making brilliant, on-the-spot observations about the game (\"Good shots must come in groups of two\"). Over the course of one unforgettable year, Bamberger caddied in the national championships of Portugal, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, and, finally, Scotland, golf's ancestral home. Once there, Bamberger fell under the spell of one of golf's great teachers and thinkers, John Stark.  To the Linksland  is the captivating memoir of Bamberger's golfing pilgrimage/extended honeymoon. From an all-night caddie bus on the back roads of southern Europe to Stark's secret six-hole course in the Scottish Highlands, Bamberger takes you on a journey into the heart of golf. This thirtieth-anniversary edition of Bamberger's classic, lyrical tale of discovery is bookended with a new introduction by Michael Murphy and a new afterword by Bamberger.  To the Linksland  is a \"great book for your golfing soul\" ( Golf Monthly ). "

                "This is the definitive account of the career of the winningest Supercar driver of all time, Jamie Whincup \ufffd- most championships, most race wins, most pole positions, most podiums. But it's also the story of the  making  of a champion - the drive, the beliefs, the grind and the teamwork that it takes to get to the top, on the track and off. With such success, it's easy to understand why Jamie has always had a target painted squarely on his rear spoiler. And it all started back in 1991, when his father purchased Jamie his first-ever go-kart. With a fierce attitude and relentless desire to win, it was only a matter of time before Whincup made the leap to V8 Supercars. Spotted by Garry Rogers, he made his debut at the Queensland 500 in 2002 before graduating to a full-time position with the team a year later. But there are ups and downs to life in the fast lane - loss of team sponsors, the rivalries, the fans, the partnerships, being true to the dream when everything looks like an off-ramp. Given a lifeline by Tasman Motorsport in 2005, Whincup responded in style, partnering the late Jason Richards to podium results at Sandown and Bathurst. It was there that Triple Eight Race Engineering owner Roland Dane, a relative newcomer to Australian motorsport, spotted Whincup's talents. In 2008, Jamie would finish the job after several near-misses at the title, sealing the crown in style with a victory in Race 1 at Oran Park. Six Supercar titles, four Bathurst 1000 victories and a Bathurst 12-hour win in the books, you'd be tempted to ride off into the sunset. But that's never been Jamie's style. While 2021 might be the close of a brilliant career behind the wheel, it's just the start of the next phase: team principal of Triple Eight Race Engineering a mentor the next generation of champions.

Raised in Dublin, Ireland, in a devoutly Catholic family, Rebecca Quin constantly invented new ways to make her mother worry\u2014roughhousing with the neighborhood kids, hosting secret parties while her parents were away, enrolling in a warehouse wrestling school, nearly breaking her neck and almost kneecapping a WWE star before her own wrestling career even began\u2014and she was always in search of a thrilling escape from the ordinary.   Rebecca's childhood love of wrestling set her on an unlikely path. With few female wrestlers to look to for guidance, Rebecca pursued a wrestling career hoping to change the culture and move it away from the antiquated disrespect so often directed at the elite female athletes who grace the ring. Even as a teenager, she knew that she would stop at nothing to earn a space among the greatest wrestlers of our time and to pave a new path for female fighters.

                "A lyrical memoir that interweaves wilderness, homeland, cultural connections, historical figures, humor, and gritty experiences across northern Alaska From the award-winning author of Ice Bear: The Cultural History of an Arctic Icon comes an intimate exploration of Alaska's northernmost mountain range with observations on Indigenous cultures, conservation, and intense cross-country travel, all shaped by respect for the land. Follow author Michael Engelhard through tussock-studded tundra for a remarkable tale of bear encounters and white-knuckled river moments, as well as poetic reflections on a vast, untamed landscape. A trained anthropologist, Engelhard evokes classic writers like Edward Abbey, Barry Lopez, and Ellen Meloy with profound dives into human and natural history and vivid meditations on Alaskan wildlife, flora, and geology. When he embarked on this thru-hike, fewer people had completed it solo in a single push than had dived to the floor of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Much more than a captivating account of a human-powered solo thru-hike and float, Arctic Traverse illuminates the spirit of Alaska, drawing on encounters with Indigenous elders, guided clients, scientists, and others as well as on Engelhard's long-held dream and his experiences of the land itself.

                "Bob Harig's latest deep-dive into Tiger Woods' thrilling career, as seen through his iconic 2019 Masters comeback and win.   In April of 1997, the world of golf was forever changed. At the age of 21, a young Tiger Woods won the most prestigious golf tournament in the world, the Masters, by a record of 12 strokes. Woods became the youngest golfer ever to win the Masters and the first African or Asian-American player to win a major. History had been made - and would continue to be made over the next 15 years. Woods transformed the game, turning golf geeks into keen observers, casual golf fans into ardent followers and even indifferent sports fans into curiosity mavens. He will undoubtedly be known for the raw numbers: 82 PGA Tour titles, 15 major championships, and according to Forbes, a billionaire who amassed more than $110-million in official PGA Tour earnings. Woods has proven to be a complicated figure through his decades in the spotlight. Plagued by marital scandal, a DUI arrest, and severe back injuries that resulted in what even he believed would be a career-ending spinal fusion surgery in 2017, Woods' career finally seemed to be coming to an end. That all changed through 2018 and into 2019 as Woods returned slowly from the surgery. In 2019, on the same course where he won for the first time in 1997, Tiger Woods made history once again, winning the Masters one final time. The 2019 Masters brought together all the qualities that ultimately make up someone who has been an enduring figure for 30 years. In this captivating and emotional portrait of one of the most famous figures in sports, Bob Harig brings readers the true story of the grit and perseverance of Tiger Woods in the final years of his career.  Drive  will show that Woods' true legacy is one of resolve and redemption.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

Charlie Hustle  chronicles one of the most polarizing figures in sports.\"\u2014NPR, All Things Considered \u201cBaseball biography at its best. With  Charlie Hustle , Pete Rose finally gets the book he deserves, and baseball fans get the book we\u2019ve been craving, a hard-hitting, beautifully-written tale that will stand for years to come as the\u00a0definitive account of one of the most fascinating figures in American sports history.\u201d\u2014Jonathan Eig,  New York Times  bestselling author of  King: A Life   Pete Rose is a legend. A baseball god. He compiled more hits than anyone in the history of baseball, a record he set decades ago that still stands today. He was a working-class white guy from Cincinnati who made it; less talented than tough, and rough around the edges. He was everything that America wanted and needed him to be, the American dream personified, until he wasn\u2019t. In the 1980s, Pete Rose came to be at the center of one of the biggest scandals in baseball history. He kept secrets, ran with bookies, took on massive gambling debts, and he was magnificently, publicly cast out for betting on baseball and lying about it. The revelations that followed ruined him, changed life in Cincinnati, and forever altered the game.  Charlie Hustle  tells the full story of one of America\u2019s most epic tragedies\u2014the rise and fall of Pete Rose. Drawing on firsthand interviews with Rose himself and with his associates, as well as on investigators' reports, FBI and court records, archives, a mountain of press coverage, Keith O\u2019Brien chronicles how Rose fell so far from being America\u2019s \u201cgreat white hope.\u201d It is Pete Rose as we've never seen him before. This is no ordinary sport biography, but cultural history at its finest. What O\u2019Brien shows is that while Pete Rose didn\u2019t change, America and baseball did. This is the story of that change. "

                "Following in the footsteps of Robeson, Ali, Robinson and others, today\u2019s Black athletes re-engage with social issues and the meaning of American patriotism   Named a best book of 2018 by  Library Journal   It used to be that politics and sports were as separate from one another as church and state. The ballfield was an escape from the world\u2019s worst problems, top athletes were treated like heroes, and cheering for the home team was as easy and innocent as hot dogs and beer. \u201cNo news on the sports page\u201d was a governing principle in newsrooms. That was then. Today, sports arenas have been transformed into staging grounds for American patriotism and the hero worship of law enforcement. Teams wear camouflage jerseys to honor those who serve; police officers throw out first pitches; soldiers surprise their families with homecomings at halftime. Sports and politics are decidedly entwined. But as journalist Howard Bryant reveals, this has always been more complicated for black athletes, who from the start, were committing a political act simply by being on the field. In fact, among all black employees in twentieth-century America, perhaps no other group had more outsized influence and power than ballplayers. The immense social responsibilities that came with the role is part of the black athletic heritage. It is a heritage built by the influence of the superstardom and radical politics of Paul Robeson, Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith, and John Carlos through the 1960s; undermined by apolitical, corporate-friendly \u201ctranscenders of race,\u201d O. J. Simpson, Michael Jordan, and Tiger Woods in the following decades; and reclaimed today by the likes of LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick, and Carmelo Anthony.  The Heritage  is the story of the rise, fall, and fervent return of the athlete-activist. Through deep research and interviews with some of sports\u2019 best-known stars\u2014including Kaepernick, David Ortiz, Charles Barkley, and Chris Webber\u2014as well as members of law enforcement and the military, Bryant details the collision of post-9/11 sports in America and the politically engaged post-Ferguson black athlete.

That they are seen and valued, that they are not alone and they are not unprotected?\" Rachael Denhollander's voice was heard around the world when she spoke out to end the most shocking scandal in US gymnastics history. The first victim to publicly accuse Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who abused hundreds of young athletes, Rachael now reveals her full story for the first time. How did Nassar get away with it for so long? How did Rachael and the other survivors finally stop him and bring him to justice? And how can we protect the vulnerable in our own families, churches, and communities? What Is a Girl Worth? is the inspiring true story of Rachael's journey from an idealistic young gymnast to a strong and determined woman who found the courage to raise her voice against evil, even when she thought the world might not listen. This deeply personal and compelling narrative shines a spotlight on the physical and emotional impact of abuse, why so many survivors are reluctant to speak out, what it means to be believed, the extraordinary power of faith and forgiveness, and how we can learn to do what's right in the moments that matter most.

He was ignored, degraded, encouraged, and praised. He was hired and fired, told he had the \"wrong body type to ride\" and that he had found his \"destiny.\" He got married and lost loved ones. Through it all he studied the horse, and human nature, and how the two can find balance. And in that journey, he may have found himself. "

                "\"I hated every minute of training, but I said: 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.'\" - Muhammad Ali  Behind every goal accomplished is a journey filled with confidence, success, and admiration but also challenges, disappointments, and moments of despair. But even when there are hardships, unseen struggles, dark times of indecision, injuries, and financial problems, there are also moments of motivation, self-awareness, and coping strategies to help you push through the negative to reach the positive. Everyone has a story of success. Everyone has a story of failure or missed opportunities.  So You Want to Be a Fighter?  collects these kinds of stories in one place-told by well-known (and not-so-well-known) trainers, boxers, and MMA fighters, including Chris Algieri, former junior welterweight boxing champion and undefeated kickboxer. You'll hear about accomplishments, mishaps, tears of joy and pain, moments of utter frustration but also jubilation, and stories about what might have been if things had gone a little bit differently. If you've ever wondered what boxers and MMA fighters endure behind the scenes-maybe you yearn to join them? - this is the audiobook that will bring you all the different aspects to competing in a fight sport. \u00a9 2022 Chris Algieri \u00a9 2022 DK Audio.

Few names in the history of baseball evoke the excellence and dynamism that Rickey Henderson's does. He holds the record for the most stolen bases in a single game, and he's scored more runs than any player ever. \"If you cut Rickey Henderson in half, you'd have two Hall of Famers,\" the baseball historian Bill James once said.  But perhaps even more than his prowess on the field, Rickey Henderson's is a story of Oakland, California, the town that gave rise to so many legendary athletes like him. And it's a story of a sea change in sports, when athletes gained celebrity status and Black players finally earned equitable salaries. Henderson embraced this shift with his trademark style, playing for nine different teams throughout his decades-long career and sculpting a brash, larger-than-life persona that stole the nation's heart. Now, in the hands of critically acclaimed sportswriter and culture critic Howard Bryant, one of baseball's greatest and most original stars finally gets his due.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

For decades in America, car racing meant NASCAR, and to a lesser extent IndyCar, with Formula 1\u2014the wealthiest racing league in the world\u2014a distant third. Fast forward to 2023, and F1 has emerged at the front of the pack powered by a passionate yet nascent American fanbase. The F1 juggernaut has arrived, but this checkered flag was far from inevitable.  In The Formula, Wall Street Journal reporters Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg tell the epic story of how F1 saved itself from collapse and finally conquered America through guile, fearlessness, and above all, reinvention. With fast cars, big money, glamorous locales, and beautiful people as the backdrop, The Formula reveals how F1's sudden arrival in the US was actually decades in the making, a product of the sport's near-constant state of transformation and experimentation. Bringing unique insight and access to F1's most storied teams and personalities\u2014from Ferrari to Bernie Ecclestone to Christian Horner to Lewis Hamilton\u2014The Formula offers a riveting portrait of the drivers, corporations, cars, rivalries, and audacious gambles that have shaped the sport for half a century.  The end result is a high-octane history of how modern F1 racing came to be\u2014the first book to tell the story of the outrageous successes and spectacular crashes that led F1 to this extraordinary yet precarious moment. More than just a sports story, The Formula is the tale of a disrupter that broke into the crowded American sports marketplace and claimed its place through cash, personality, and a new understanding of what a sport needs to be in the age of wall-to-wall entertainment.

                "Being the fastest cyclist in the world at the start line means nothing if your mind isn't strong enough to get you to the finish line In 2018, Leigh Timmis became the fastest person to cycle across Europe - in just 16 days, 10 hours and 45 minutes - breaking the previous world record by an astonishing 8 days and 17 hours. But when he set out to break the record, Leigh wasn't just trying to conquer the road. As he prepared his body for this ultra-endurance world record attempt, Leigh realized that he would have to confront deeper problems to make it to the finish line. Although test results showed that he already had the physical ability of an elite athlete, something was holding him back: his troubled mind. With the support of psychologists and sports science experts, Leigh confronted the past that had left him with vulnerabilities he would need to understand and overcome in the pursuit of performance. Then, cycling for 14 hours a day, from the west coast of Portugal to the edge of Siberia, he embarked on far more than just a physical journey. The Race of Truth is the remarkable true story of personal transformation against the clock, and the astonishing feats we can accomplish when we face up to our deepest fears. "

Life in the G is about the arduous quest to achieve an improbable goal: making it to the NBA. Life in the G League is far from glamorous. Players make enormous sacrifices and work unimaginable hours in the hope that someone in the NBA will give them a chance. To this day, very few fans-even the most passionate followers of the NBA-know much about the G League. In the fall of 2021, the Birmingham Squadron granted author Alex Squadron complete access to the team to capture the experience of playing in the league. That year, with hundreds of NBA players sidelined by the highly contagious Omicron variant of COVID-19, the G League saw a record number of call-ups. Sports Illustrated labeled it \"the year of the NBA replacement player.\" Many of those players stayed in the NBA, earning life-changing contracts and taking on significant roles for their new teams. In addition to recounting the organization's inaugural season, Squadron's access to the Birmingham Squadron enabled him to document the incredible journeys of G League players and to tell the larger story of life in the G. This is the inspiring tale of an unforgettable season and the emotional roller coaster for everyone involved in the chase for an NBA dream. "

                "A  NEW YORK TIMES  BESTSELLER       A powerful memoir from the University of Kentucky basketball legend, NBA veteran, and social media influencer about his recovery from addiction.   He is considered by many the greatest basketball player ever produced by the hoops-crazy state of Kentucky. In two years at the University of Kentucky, he scored over 1,000 points, led the Wildcats to a Sweet Sixteen appearance and was nicknamed \"King Rex.\" The first player ever drafted by the Charlotte Hornets, he spent twelve seasons in the NBA, dazzling in dunk contests and sinking one of the most memorable buzzer-beaters in league history. But by the end of his career, Rex Chapman was harboring a destructive secret.    Years before America's opioid crisis would become national news, Chapman developed a dependency on Vicodin and Oxycontin, ultimately ingesting fifty painkillers a day. In addition, he developed a severe gambling addiction, once nearly losing $400,000 at a Las Vegas blackjack table. All this would cost him his family as well as most of the $40 million fortune he'd made in basketball, leaving him to live in his car and shoplift to support his addictions. Only when he was arrested\u2014and his mugshot made national news\u2014did he finally commit to getting clean.   In  It's Hard for Me to Live With Me , Chapman\u2014who has amassed millions of social media followers for his relatable and uplifting posts\u2014tells the story of his addiction and recovery in unflinching detail. With equal frankness, he describes his history with depression; the racism he witnessed growing up and how that shaped his outspokenness on matters of social justice; and his complex and volatile relationship with his father, also a former professional basketball player. Cowritten with  New York Times  bestselling author Seth Davis, Chapman's memoir is an equally devastating and inspiring story about the human struggle for self-acceptance. "

                "Dan \"Hendo\" Henderson was the first fighter in MMA history to become a double champion, winning championships in PRIDE Fighting Championships and Strikeforce. He faced the biggest names in MMA, on his unparalleled run through the early days of MMA through its remarkable rise in popularity, squaring off against the likes of Fedor Emelianenko, Anderson Silva, Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson, Wanderlei Silva, Michael Bisping, Vitor Belfort, and Renzo Gracie. Henderson's first fight against Mauricio \"Shogun\" Rua in 2011 is considered one of the greatest fights in UFC history. In this no-holds-barred look back on his life, Henderson provides context and insight into the biggest fights of his career, while reflecting on the wholly unique upbringing that shaped him into the warrior he needed to be to win. With his trademark humor, he sheds light on his two trips to the Olympics, his transformative time training in Europe and Russia, and his up-and-down relationship with Dana White. Hendo: The American Athlete is a thrilling window into the life and mind of a true legend. There will never be another fighter like Hendo. "

Dear Black Girls  is a must-read for every Black girl out there.\" \u2015Gabrielle Union,  New York Times  bestselling author of  We're Going to Need More Wine  and  You Got Anything Stronger?     This one is for all the girls with an apostrophe in their names.      This is for all the girls who are labeled \"too loud\" and \"too emotional.\"      This is for all the girls who are constantly asked, \"Oh, what did you do with your hair? That's new.\"      This is for my Black girls.   Despite gold medals, WNBA championships, and a list of accolades, A'ja Wilson knows how it feels to be swept under the rug\u2014to not be heard, to not feel seen, to not be taken seriously. As a fourth grader going to a primarily white school in South Carolina, A'ja was told she'd have to stay outside for a classmate's birthday party. \"Huh?\" she asked. Because the birthday girl's father didn't like Black people. Wilson tells stories like this, about how even when life tried to hold her down, it didn't stop her. She shares her contribution to \"The Talk,\" and how to keep fighting, all while igniting strength, passion, and joy.  Dear Black Girls  is a necessary and meaningful exploration of what it means to be a Black woman in America today\u2014and a rallying cry to lift up women and girls everywhere.  \"\u200b D\u200bear Black Girls  is filled with phenomenal stories and empowering insight on what it means to be a woman in today's world.

Wanderers traces their footsteps, from eighteenth-century parson's daughter Elizabeth Carter-who desired nothing more than to be taken for a vagabond in the wilds of southern England-to modern walker-writers such as Nan Shepherd and Cheryl Strayed. For each, walking was integral, whether it was rambling for miles across the Highlands, like Sarah Stoddart Hazlitt, or pacing novels into being, as Virginia Woolf did around Bloomsbury. Offering a beguiling view of the history of walking, Wanderers guides us through the different ways of seeing-of being-articulated by these ten pathfinding women. "

Beautiful, blonde, Midwestern, and media-trained, she was suddenly being written up everywhere from  The New Yorker  to  Teen Vogue  to  People  and baking cookies with Taylor Swift. But little did the public know what Gold was facing when the cameras were off, driven by the self-destructive voice inside that she calls \u201coutofshapeworthlessloser.\u201d\u00a0In 2017, she entered treatment for what was publicly announced as an eating disorder and anxiety treatment but was, in reality, suicidal ideation. While Gold\u2019s public star was rising, her private life was falling apart: Cracks within her family were widening, her bulimia was getting worse, and she became a survivor of sexual assault. The pressure of training for years with demanding coaches and growing up in a household that accepted nothing less than gold had finally taken its toll. Now Gold reveals the exclusive and harrowing story of her struggles in and out of the pressure-packed world of elite figure skating: the battles with her family, her coaches, the powers-that-be at her federation, and her deteriorating mental health.  Outofshapeworthlessloser  is not only a forceful reckoning from a world-class athlete but also\u00a0an intimate memoir, told with unflinching honesty and stirring defiance. "

                "The Rip Curl Story  is the remarkable tale of two young surfers who pursued an audacious dream to make a living in pursuit of the ultimate ride. The brand they built, Rip Curl, not only satisfied their own surf- and wanderlust, but also inspired countless others, both fuelling and riding the wave of the global youth revolution of the late '60s. Rip Curl's mantra became 'the Search' - the chasing of new waves on distant shores - as they embraced new thrills such as skiing, snowboarding, windsurfing and aimed always to make better equipment to elevate the experience. Along the way, they supported the careers of many of the world's great surfers: from Midget Farrelly and Nat Young to Michael Peterson, Tom Curren to Damien Hardman, Pam Burridge to Stephanie Gilmore, and of course Tyler Wright and the legendary Mick Fanning. From the late-'60s era of peace, drugs and country soul to the birth of professionalism in the '70s; from the decadence and excess of the '80s to the new nomadic free-surfing trail of the '90s, and the bold new frontiers of surfing in the 2000s - wave pools, webcasts, Olympic acceptance -  The Rip Curl Story  explores both the evolution of a world-leading surf brand and an entire social revolution. Bestselling surf writer Tim Baker tells this implausible story in an irresistible series of ripping yarns, offering rich life lessons, a maverick business primer and a wild ride of adventure, good times and outlandish ambitions spectacularly realised.  The Rip Curl Story  will make you want to surf more, travel further, follow through on that great business idea and pursue your own Search. "

Highly recommend'  RONNIE O'SULLIVAN  'Entertaining and enlightening'  MATTHEW SYED  '  Simon has looked into something we actually all know or at least once did - the ability to live life more in the now'  JASON FOX  Simon Mundie, host of  The Life Lessons  podcast ,  draws on interviews with some of the world's sporting legends to redefine how we understand \u2013 and pursue - success through 8 key lessons.  As the  sports reporter for BBC Radio 1  for the best part of a decade, Simon Mundie was pitch-side at many of the most high-profile sporting events in history. It was often thrilling, but the emphasis always seemed to be on results, tactics and the score. But as the saying goes, sport is a metaphor for life \u2013 so Simon set out to explore that. Drawing on interviews with sporting legends from  Jonny Wilkinson to Kate Richardson-Walsh, Caitlyn Jenner to Goldie Sayers , along with psychologists, philosophers and world-renowned thinkers, Simon shares some of the tools and techniques that sportspeople have embraced to grow and evolve. From  developing   emotional intelligence  to the  power of true acceptance  and the  joy of getting in flow , he explores eight universal themes that are highlighted in sport, but that are all too easily overlooked. What can the careers of  Ga\u00ebl Monfils and Andy Murray  teach us about exploring our potential? What can  England's Olympic gold-medal winning hockey team  teach us about the power of being truly selfless? Wise and inspiring,  Champion Thinking  illustrates that the contentment we are all looking for isn't somewhere 'out there' \u2013 it's actually so close that we tend to overlook it.  'The intention behind this book is beautiful, and I highly recommend it'  RUPERT SPIRA  'Mundie understands something most of us discover eventually: that the pursuit of sporting excellence is the best guide we have to what it means to be human'  AMOL RAJAN.

                "In Fans Have More Friends, sports fans, dads, and data analysts David Sikorjak and Ben Valenta argue that fandom can not only increase our sense of belonging but also serves as a powerful antidote to loneliness because sports fans experience increased social connection. What they didn't realize was how deep that connection was, the potential it carried for individual and societal wellness, or the opportunities it offered for adult friendships, making and keeping friends, and family ties. Their theory is simple: if we want to be less lonely, we need to belong to a community or something greater than ourselves. Over the course of two years, countless in-person interviews and rigorously designed surveys, Ben Valenta and David Sikorjak have the proof that being a fan can lead to: improved social connections; stronger community ties; enhanced well-being; a greater sense of belonging; and more friends. The common thread in all of these personal stories is friendship, community, and belonging-a feeling research can't reveal as well as stories can. Fans Have More Friends will make you think differently about sports and reminds all of us of the essential animating quality of fandom: We're in this together. Sports is not always about what's happening on the field but what's happening in the stands. "

A desperately hard race through a beautiful country, the Giro has bred characters and stories that dramatize the shifting culture and society of its home. There was Alfonsina Strada, who cropped her hair and raced against the men in 1924 and Ottavio Bottecchia, expected to challenge for the winner's Maglia Rosa, the famed pink jersey, in 1928, until he was killed on a training ride\u2014most likely by Mussolini's Black Shirts. And what would a book about the Giro d'Italia be without Fausto Coppi, the metropolitan playboy with amphetamines in his veins, guided by a mystic blind masseur, who seemed to glide up the peaks. But let us not forget his arch rival Gino Bartali\u2014humble, pious, and brave. It recently emerged that he smuggled papers for persecuted Jewish Italians. Then there is the Giro's most tragic hero, Marco Pantani, born to climb but fated to lose. Halted only by World Wars, the Giro has been contested for over a century, and The Beautiful Race is a richly written celebration of this legendary race. "

                "What separates Winners from everyone else?     In September 2015, Shane Watson, one of cricket's greatest allrounders, was contemplating retirement. At 34, he was still in great physical shape, but his form had deteriorated following a tragedy the year before. Mentally, he was in the darkest hole of his life.  A chance meeting with IndyCar champion Will Power changed everything, prompting Shane to work with world-renowned mental performance coach Dr Jacques Dallaire. It was a decision that would reshape his life.  Watson discovered the keys to a consistent mental process that gave him access to his skillset once more. Across his career he'd had many glimpses of the right mindset but had so often sabotaged himself as he lacked the understanding, tools, and blueprint to repeat them. Watson would go on to dominate global T20 cricket, testing his new mental process against the best players in the world.   In The Winner's Mindset, Watson shares the secrets that helped him tap into his skillset at will. Using his own in-game experiences, scientific methodology and an easy-to-understand mental skills framework, he makes you performance ready for every situation, eliminating stress and anxiety. Whether you're a cricketer or simply seeking success in life, you'll learn universal techniques that apply to any performance arena. "

By the 1970s, fiberglass and graphite changed the world of fly-fishing. But more and more anglers are seeing bamboo rods in retail outlets, and want to give them a try. With this book, John Gierach, one of the nation's top fly-fishing writers, provides a philosophical guide to the angler who seeks this new \"old\" method. Gierach discusses how bamboo rods are built, how they differ from graphite rods, and how using one will change a fly fisher's approach to the sport. Fishing bamboo might be the pinnacle of fly-casting skill, and this book will help take you there. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin.  Travel-writer, novelist and singer-songwriter Malachy Tallack has been passionate about fishing since he was young. Growing up in Shetland, with its myriad lochs, he and his brother would roam the island in search of trout, and in so doing discovered a sense of freedom, of wonder, and an abiding passion. But why is it that catching a fish - or simply  contemplating  catching a fish - can be so thrilling, so captivating? Why is it that time spent beside water can be imprinted so sharply in the memory? Why is it that what seems such a simple act - that of casting a line and hoping - can feel so rich in mystery?  Illuminated by Water  is Malachy's personal attempt to understand that freedom, and to trace the origins and sources of that sense of wonder. He shares the appeal of fishing, its intense joys and frustrations, the steadying effect it has both at water's edge and in the memory, and the contemplation of nature and landscape that comes with being an angler. He writes about fishing expeditions, from English canals and Scottish lochs to lakes in Canada and New Zealand, and he reflects on other aspects of angling, from its cultural significance and the emerging moral complexities to the intricacies of tying a fly. Beautifully written and hugely engaging, this book both articulates the inexplicable lure of the river and the endless desire to return to it, and illuminates a passion that has shaped the way so many see and think about the natural world. \u00a9 Malachy Tallack 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022.
