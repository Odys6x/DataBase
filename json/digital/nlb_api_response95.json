As an admissions officer specializing in diversity recruitment for independent prep schools, she persuaded students and families to embark on the same perilous journey she herself had made\u2014to attend cutthroat and largely white schools similar to The Taft School, where she had been the first African-American legacy student only a few years earlier. Her new job forced her to reflect on her own elite education experience, and to realize how disillusioned she had become with America's inequitable system. In ADMISSIONS, Kendra looks back at the three years she spent at Taft, chronicling clashes with her lily-white roommate, how she had to unlearn the respectability politics she'd been raised with, and the fall-out from a horrifying article in the student newspaper that accused Black and Latinx students of being responsible for segregation of campus. Through these stories, some troubling, others hilarious, she deconstructs the lies and half-truths she herself would later tell as an admissions professional, in addition to the myths about boarding schools perpetuated by popular culture. With its combination of incisive social critique and uproarious depictions of elite nonsense, ADMISSIONS will resonate with anyone who has ever been The Only One in a room, dealt with racial microaggressions, or even just suffered from an extreme case of homesickness.

But he also knows that proximity to people who are different from ourselves can be a cure for racism.   Tyler Merritt's video \"Before You Call the Cops\" has been viewed millions of times. He's appeared on  Jimmy Kimmel  and  Sports Illustrated  and has been profiled in the  New York Times . The viral video's main point\u2014the more you know someone, the more empathy, understanding, and compassion you have for that person\u2014is the springboard for this book. By sharing his highs and exposing his lows, Tyler welcomes us into his world in order to help bridge the divides that seem to grow wider every day. In  I Take My Coffee Black,  Tyler tells hilarious stories from his own life as a black man in America. He talks about growing up in a multi-cultural community and realizing that he wasn't always welcome, how he quit sports for musical theater (that's where the girls were) to how Jesus barged in uninvited and changed his life forever (it all started with a Triple F.A.T. Goose jacket) to how he ended up at a small Bible college in Santa Cruz because he thought they had a great theater program (they didn't). Throughout his stories, he also seamlessly weaves in lessons about privilege, the legacy of lynching and sharecropping and why you don't cross black mamas. He teaches readers about the history of encoded racism that still undergirds our society today. By turns witty, insightful, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny,  I Take My Coffee Black  paints a portrait of black manhood in America and enlightens, illuminates, and entertains\u2014ultimately building the kind of empathy that might just be the antidote against the racial injustice in our society.

If you've watched television or movies in the past year, you've seen Michelle Buteau. With scene-stealing roles in  Always Be My Maybe ,  First Wives Club ,  Someone Great ,  Russian Doll , and  Tales of the City ; a reality TV show and breakthrough stand-up specials, including her headlining show  Welcome to   Buteaupia  on Netflix, and two podcasts ( Late Night Whenever  and  Adulting ), Michelle's star is on the rise. You'd be forgiven for thinking the road to success\u2014or adulthood or financial stability or self-acceptance or marriage or motherhood\u2014has been easy; but you'd be wrong.    Now, in  Survival of the Thickest , Michelle reflects on growing up Caribbean, Catholic, and thick in New Jersey, going to college in Miami (where everyone smells like pineapple), her many friendship and dating disasters, working as a newsroom editor during 9/11, getting started in standup opening for male strippers, marrying into her husband's Dutch family, IVF and surrogacy, motherhood, chosen family, and what it feels like to have a full heart, tight jeans, and stardom finally in her grasp.

                "\"In this candid and insightful new memoir, Kim Stolz discusses the trials and tribulations of our obsession with social media and mobile technology...a Tweet-worthy, share-worthy, Instagrammable look into our society and the lives we create online.\" \u2014 Harper's Bazaar     An incisive, hilarious, and brutally honest chronicle of our obsessions with connectivity, by a self-proclaimed social media addict.  Breaking up used to be easy. You'd sit down, air your grievances, shed some tears, then commiserate with your friends over a pint of ice cream. But then it was over. Your ex was history. And if you lived in a big enough city, chances are you'd never bump into him or her again.    But the golden age of break-ups has come and gone. Today our exes, former friends, estranged relatives, and even that random person we met that one night in Vegas are just a thumb tap away, their lives playing out in an endless soap opera of status updates, selfies, Snapchats, and Tweets. The ways we interact with each other have changed forever. But our desire for human connection remains the same.

In this universally accessible New York Times bestseller named for her wildly popular web series, Issa Rae&#8212;\"a singular voice with the verve and vivacity of uncorked champagne\" (Kirkus Reviews)&#8212;waxes humorously on what it's like to be unabashedly awkward in a world that regards introverts as hapless misfits and black as cool.I'm awkward&#8212;and black. Someone once told me those were the two worst things anyone could be. That someone was right. Where do I start? Being an introvert (as well as \"funny,\" according to the Los Angeles Times) in a world that glorifies cool isn't easy. But when Issa Rae, the creator of the Shorty Award-winning hit series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, is that introvert&#8212;whether she's navigating love, the workplace, friendships, or \"rapping\"&#8212;it sure is entertaining. Now, in this New York Times bestselling debut collection written in her witty and self-deprecating voice, Rae covers everything from cybersexing in the early days of the Internet to deflecting unsolicited comments on weight gain, from navigating the perils of eating out alone and public displays of affection to learning to accept yourself&#8212;natural hair and all. The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl is a book no one&#8212;awkward or cool, black, white, or other&#8212;will want to miss. "

Living well doesn't happen automatically for followers of Christ\u2014it happens when we have planned ahead by reviewing and recalibrating our lives on a regular basis, and when we transition from one stage of life to the next. Times of transition, especially in midlife or later life, are ideal moments for recalibrating our priorities and habits.  Ken Boa and Jenny Abel give us the perspective and practical tools needed to evaluate our God-given gifts, talents, skills, wisdom, knowledge, resources, and opportunities so we can use them to the full extent God desires. It involves an intentional recalibration and envisioning of one's life based on God's universal and unique purposes for each person as we move from the demands of our careers into a deeper sense of calling. This eternal perspective allows us to live meaningfully now and into the future so that the best is yet to come. "

Danny has an incredible knack for taking the bizarre fringes and rabbit holes of humanity and making them compulsively laugh-out-loud readable.'  - Danny Robins, journalist, presenter of Uncanny and writer of 2:22 A Ghost Story  'Danny Wallace lightens this dark topic about lies and propaganda with his trademark humour and gets the balance just right'  \u2013 BBC, Books to Read in 2024  Have you been keeping your eye on your grandma lately? Have you been calling her enough? You sure she's not spending too much time on YouTube? Is she talking fondly of dictators? Has she suddenly started quietly muttering in the Aldi queue about the \"Jewish Space Lasers\" she's heard are setting wildfires around the world to make sure everyone believes in climate change? When was the moment the world began to believe anything?  Danny Wallace, million-copy bestselling author of  Yes Man  and  Join Me , has fallen down the modern rabbit hole of lies, conspiracies and disinformation. Along the way, he encounters families torn apart by accusations and fake news, journalists putting themselves on the frontline of the disinformation war, reformed conspiracy theorists, influencers who see profit in stoking paranoia, and the shadowy nameless, faceless trolls on the other side of our screens. He discovers how disinformation and well-told lies can ruin a year or a whole life, how they can affect our family, our street, our community. How they can spread across a country, a continent, even the world. How they take hold of our imaginations and make us feel both helpless and powerful. And Danny asks: can you do anything to stop it \u2013 even with the truth on your side?. "

When Ronald Reagan warned that freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction, was he pointing to Generation Z?    Today's young adults have been indoctrinated since preschool in the lie that America is fundamentally unjust. They have watched their parents hand over their freedom to big government, and they themselves are captivated by a deceptive ideology of unprecedented radicalism.    Out of this confused and dispirited generation has risen Brilyn Hollyhand, who offers his peers a prophetic vision of the greatness of America and its heritage. Drawing on the wisdom of the generations that founded, fought for, and preserved this great nation, Hollyhand defies the poisonous anti-Americanism would cheat our youth out of their birthright of freedom.    Hollyhand explains how we got into this mess and presents a plan for turning the tide. Wise beyond his years, he is a happy warrior in the battle of ideas, inspiring his contemporaries and encouraging the older generations. "

                "A compelling call to embrace the countercultural values of Jesus, which lead to a life of love, peace, and fulfillment, from the bestselling author of  The Deeply Formed Life,  winner of the  Christianity Today  Book Award.   \u201cIn  The Narrow Path,  Rich unpacks what living our best life truly looks like. This book is a much-needed heart checkup for every Jesus follower.\u201d\u2014Christine Caine, founder of A21 and Propel Women  We live in a culture that wants it all. More is seen as better\u2014whether it\u2019s more money, social media fame, choices, or power. For those chasing this way of life, \u201cnarrow\u201d seems negative. Who wants to narrow their options . . . or be seen as narrow-minded? Which is why the most well-known talk in the history of the world\u2014the Sermon on the Mount\u2014is also the most paradoxical one. In it, Jesus holds up the narrow path as the most spacious . . . and the broader path as the more confining one. Rich Villodas, bestselling author of  The Deeply Formed Life,  explores what today\u2019s broad and narrow paths look like so you can discern which one you\u2019re on. The answer may surprise you\u2014and will help you pursue the way of Jesus more deeply when it comes to loving God and others, prayer, sexual desire, conflict, money, anxiety, and more.  The Narrow Path  reintroduces the counterintuitive wonder of Jesus\u2019s timeless wisdom for this age, one fraught with anxiety, depression, polarizing politics, and online vitriol. The path of Jesus is most certainly narrow, but it is the only one filled with the ever-expanding life of God . . . and it is available now for all who want it!. "

                "Nothing Is Wasted  is a story for anyone who has encountered trauma, tragedy, or a major transition and wondered,  How do I begin to move forward through what I've experienced?    Where is God in the midst of your greatest pain?      Davey Blackburn wrestled with that age-old question in the aftermath of the murder of his beloved wife, Amanda, and their unborn daughter. As the high-profile case slowly meandered its way toward legal justice, Davey embarked on the wrenching task of finding strength to restore his shattered soul and the broken pieces of his life.    At turns horrific yet hope-filled, heartbreaking yet faith-affirming,  Nothing Is Wasted  is Blackburn's disarmingly raw account not only of the shocking tragedy that forever changed his life but of his late wife's inspiring trust in the God who welcomed her into His loving arms.    The trauma he endured could have made anyone try to escape from the agony, yet by grace Blackburn chose to face the pain head-on and cling to his Savior to guide him through the storm.    As the riveting story of one man's journey through the valley of suffering unfolds, readers will join Blackburn in discovering:   the surprising ways that hope and joy can arise in the midst of any trial or sorrow   the tension in accepting that \"Why?\" may never become clear this side of eternity   how a good Father is faithful to draw near to the brokenhearted   how forgiveness is the key to finding freedom in even the most unimaginable of offenses   where to discover purpose in the deepest pain   how a breathtaking moment at the altar symbolized love's triumph over death   . . . and much more.    Most of us will never endure the depth of heartache that Blackburn has walked through and yet his message is for us all: that even in the greatest losses and most complex tragedies, God is inviting us on a path towards redemption and healing, hope and faith, where we can begin to see that  nothing is wasted.

                "Jay Ellis, star of HBO\u2019s  Insecure,   tells the story of growing up with an imaginary best friend you will never forget\u2014part Dwayne Wayne from  A Different World,  part Will Smith from  The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air \u2014in this hilarious, vulnerable memoir.   \u201cSo funny, poignant, and personal. I loved this and you will, too.\u201d\u2014Mindy Kaling, author of  Why Not Me?  and  Nothing Like I Imagined   What to do when you\u2019re the perpetual new kid, only child, and military brat hustling school to school each year and everyone\u2019s looking to you for answers? Make some shit up, of course!\u00a0And a young Jay Ellis does just that, with help from his imaginary friend, Mikey. A testament to the importance of invention, trusting oneself, and making space for creativity,  Did Everyone Have an Imaginary Friend (or Just Me)?  is a memoir of a kid who confided in his imaginary sidekick to navigate parallel pop culture universes (like watching  Fresh Prince  alongside John Hughes movies or listening to Ja Rule and Dave Matthews) to a lifetime of birthday disappointment (being a Christmas-season Capricorn will do that to you) and hoop dreams gone bad. Mikey also guides Ellis through tragedies, like losing his teenage cousin in a mistaken-target drive-by and the shame and fear of being pulled over by cops almost a dozen times the year he got his driver\u2019s license. As his imaginary friend morphs into adult consciousness,\u00a0Ellis charts an unforgettable story of looking inward to solve to some of life\u2019s biggest (and smallest) challenges, told in the roast-you-with-love voice of your closest homey.

                "The only Christian devotional on healing from codependency and establishing healthy boundaries  People struggling with codependency need God more than ever.  Healing from Codependency  invites you, the readers, to find your center by seeking God and looking inward before focusing on others. Codependency can keep you in self-neglect and preoccupied with what you cannot control, or emotionally isolated and believing you need only be self-reliant to get through the day. Whichever side you find yourself on, codependency perpetuates loneliness and isolation. But no one is alone in God\u2019s embrace. With weekly devotions, prayers, and practices based on biblical principles, this book will empower you to step out of codependent roles, embrace healthy boundaries, and live interdependently.\u00a0  Healing from Codependency  features:\u00a0    A SOLID 52-WEEK DEVOTIONAL  full of Scripture and reflections that specifically address codependency struggles\u00a0   FAITH-BASED GUIDANCE  on a wide range of codependency patterns such as caretaking, control, and denial   EASY-TO-DO SPIRITUAL PRACTICES  that help you build healthy boundaries and take back control of your life and relationships\u00a0   WEEKLY PRAYER  specifically focuses on healing from codependency.

We have been waiting for you!\u2019\u201d\u2014Charlotte Gambill,\u00a0pastor, author, and global Bible teacher  We know women are meant to bring powerful and lasting goodness into the world because God repeatedly called women to do so: He trusted Mary to give birth to Jesus, Esther to save His people, and Deborah to lead His kingdom. Yet so much of our potential is limited by our own insecurity and fear. It\u2019s time for us to stand confident in our stunning worth as royal daughters, unite in community, and walk in the unshakable hope of Christ.\u00a0 In a message that\u2019s both vibrant and conversational, Pastor Oneka McClellan reminds us that God has uniquely positioned and gifted women to be a source of life, wisdom, and strength. Through insightful biblical truths and real stories of women showing up in powerful ways, McClellan equips you to \u2022 completely trust your God-given identity \u2022 lead with courage and wisdom in any room\u00a0 \u2022 fight for the flourishing of others \u2022 celebrate the greatness in every woman \u2022 see with eyes of hope that God can redeem any story To every woman who\u2019s ever felt held back, pushed down, or disqualified from stepping fully into her purpose, McClellan\u2019s  Born Royal  offers hope, encouragement, and empowerment. It also sounds a liberating call for each and every one of us\u2014including you\u2014to walk boldly and precisely as the women God has created us to be. "

                "The Yellow House  meets  Hidden in Plain View  in this multigenerational memoir that celebrates African American quilting, family, and honoring the past.  At age four, Phyllis Biffle Elmore was plucked off her front porch in Detroit and dropped on her grandmother Lula Horn\u2019s doorstep in rural Alabama. Phyllis felt utterly abandoned until Grandma Lula showed her both all-encompassing love and her intricate \u201cQuilts of Souls.\u201d Phyllis listened intently as Lula told epic stories of folks who had passed on as she turned their clothing into breathtaking quilts for their families. Grandma Lula\u2019s generosity of spirit, strong will, and creative soul animate every page and through the quilts, she paints portraits of extraordinary Black women born before and after the Civil War. They are enslaved people, laundresses, storytellers, healers, and quilters whose stories have gone untold until now. Beautifully written and brilliantly told, Phyllis weaves back and forth through time, piecing together true tales of racism, sexism, and colorism, but also strength and pride, creating a multigenerational patchwork honoring her family and ancestors.\u00a0From the lush visuals to the powerful history,  Quilt of Souls  is oral tradition written and preserved for posterity.  \u201cLike the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama, who create masterpieces from cast-off fabrics, Phyllis Biffle Elmore in  Quilt of Souls: A Memoir  uses snippets of history and fragments of memories to craft a narrative that is a powerful and poignant read.\u201d   \u2013Jessica B. Harris,  New York Times  best-selling   author of  High on the Hog    \"A fascinating read that unravels how storytellers are born and made, with the goal or retelling family history, culture, loves, losses, victories, and the tragedies of memoerable people, from cradle to grave.\"   \u2013Omar Tyree, best-selling author and NAACP Image Award winner.

Much like a golf shot, I suppose.\"  \u2014SHEA SERRANO, #1  New York Times  bestselling author    \" How Golf Can Save Your Life  is a humble, honest, and frequently hilarious book that demystifies\u2014and transcends\u2014its subject. I'm not a golfer. But after reading it, I can say for sure that there's nobody I'd rather suck with for eighteen holes than Drew Millard.\"  \u2014ERIC NUSBAUM, author of  Stealing Home: Los Angeles, the Dodgers, and the Lives Caught in Between     \"With ceaseless humor and unyielding honesty, Drew Millard has created a unique look at the power a game can have on life. By tapping the vein of his own personal pain, Millard found that golf can be as fulfilling as frustrating. And by embracing the struggle, success can be measured in incremental increases in happiness, not in strokes.\"  \u2014BRETT CYRGALIS, author of  Golf's Holy War: The Battle for the Soul of a Game in an Age of Science      Drew Millard loves golf. We're talking climbing a mountain, jumping over the moon, standing outside golf's window holding a boom box levels of love. As a kid, he'd enjoyed the game, but since college, his clubs had been gathering dust in his parents' basement. And then, a bout with depression led him back home to haul them out of the unfinished storage area under the stairs.    It was what the doctor had ordered. In addition to medication and therapy, Drew needed to exercise. Exercise was not something he did. But golf? Sure, why not? As Drew fumbled his way through his first round in years, he discovered that sucking at golf was his new calling, one that helped him find a sense of balance and rhythm\u2014both on the course and in his own mind.    Drew's deep emotional connection to the game inspired him to write this book, and his passion is infectious. Combining great storytelling with fascinating historical tidbits and moving personal insights, he writes about everything from how golf taught him to be a better listener, son, and friend, to how to slow down, appreciate what he has, and keep fighting the good fight. Along the way, he demystifies the customs, history, and rules of the game.    Brimming with personality, accessibility, and a freewheeling spirit,  How Golf Can Save Your Life  is a celebration of the sport and an examination of all it offers. Read it and fall in love with golf\u2014for the first time or all over again. "

                "Untangling our deepest beliefs about ourselves from our most precious beliefs about God  Christians experience significant gaps between what we believe about God and what we encounter from God. We believe God loves us, but we struggle to experience it. We believe God is with us, but we struggle to see it. We thought we'd be further along in our faith by now. Often our best efforts keep us stuck in those gaps.  In The Expectation Gap, pastor and systems theorist Steve Cuss shows us how to notice stuck patterns that keep us trapped and how we can break free to engage God at a deeper and more fulfilling level. We will always have to mind the gaps, but we can learn to notice the recurring, predictable patterns that keep us stuck and spinning. Cuss offers tangible tools to quiet the inner critic, wrangle chronic anxiety, and relax into God's presence, engaging him in a deeper and more visceral way. Our regular experience of God can become more congruent with our belief about God. "

[ Home Bound  will]\u00a0appeal to a variety of\u00a0reader, challenging singular beliefs of what it means to be a daughter, sister, lover, wife, lawyer, and mother.\"   \u2014Library Journal, s tarred review  In this singular and intimate memoir of identity and discovery, Vanessa A. Bee explores the way we define \u201chome\u201d and \u201cbelonging\u201d \u2014 from her birth in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, to her adoption by her aunt and her aunt\u2019s white French husband, to experiencing housing insecurity in Europe and her eventual immigration to the US. After her parents\u2019 divorce, Vanessa traveled with her mother to Lyon and later to London, eventually settling in Reno, Nevada, as a teenager, right around the financial crisis and the collapse of the housing market. At twenty, still a practicing evangelical Christian and newly married, Vanessa applied to and was accepted by Harvard Law School, where she was one of the youngest members of her class. There, she forged a new belief system, divorced her husband, left the church, and, inspired by her tumultuous childhood, pursued a career in economic justice upon graduation. Vanessa\u2019s adoptive, multiracial, multilingual, multinational, and transcontinental upbringing has caused her to grapple for years with foundational questions such as: What is home? Is it the country we\u2019re born in, the body we possess, or the name we were given and that identifies us? Is it the house we remember most fondly, the social status assigned to us, or the ideology we forge? What defines us and makes us uniquely who we are? Organized unconventionally around her own dictionary-style definitions of the word \u201chome,\u201d Vanessa tackles these timeless questions thematically and unpacks the many layers that contribute to and condition our understanding of ourselves and of our place in the world.

                "An honest and lyrical coming-of-age memoir of growing up in South Africa at the height of apartheid, and an invitation to recognize and refuse to repeat the sins of our fathers\u2014from the bestselling author of  Never Unfriended    \u201cHeartfelt, emotionally charged reflections . . . [a] bracing memoir.\u201d \u2014Kirkus Review    \u201cImportant. Riveting. Unforgettable . . . a profoundly captivating story that can profoundly change your own story.\u201d\u2014Ann Voskamp,  New York Times  bestselling author of  WayMaker   Born White in the heart of Zululand during the racial apartheid, Lisa-Jo Baker longed to write a new future for her children\u2014a longing that set her on a journey to understand where she fit into a story of violence and faith, history and race. Before marriage and motherhood, she came to the United States to study to become a human rights advocate. When she na\u00efvely walked right into America\u2019s own turbulent racial landscape, Baker experienced the kind of painful awakening that is both individual and universal, personal and social. Yet years would go by before she traced this American trauma back to her own South African past. Baker was a teenager when her mother died of cancer, leaving her with her father. Though they shared a language of faith and justice, she often feared him, unaware that his fierce temper had deep roots in a family\u2019s and a nation\u2019s pain. Decades later, old wounds reopened when she found herself spiraling into a terrifying version of her father, screaming herself hoarse at her son. Only then did Baker realize that to go forward\u2014to refuse to repeat the sins of our fathers\u2014we must first go back. With a story that stretches from South Africa\u2019s outback to Washington, D.C.,  It Wasn\u2019t Roaring, It Was Weeping  is a courageous look at inherited hurts and prejudices, and a hope-filled example for all who feel lost in life or worried that they\u2019re too off course to make the necessary corrections. Baker\u2019s story shows that it\u2019s never too late to be free. "

                "\"As rich and thoughtful as all of Brian McLaren's work, but with a particular urgency!\"   -Bill McKibben    \"Riveting. Challenging. Brave. Devastating. Hopeful.\" -Rabbi Sharon Brous, IKAR, author of  The Amen Effect     A deeply insightful exploration of how to live with wisdom, resilience and love in our turbulent times  For the last quarter-century, author and activist Brian D. McLaren has been writing at the intersection of religious faith and contemporary culture. In  Life After Doom,  he engages with the catastrophic failure of both our religious and political leaders to address the dominant realities of our time: ecological overshoot, economic injustice, and the increasing likelihood of civilizational collapse. McLaren defines doom as the \"un-peaceful, uneasy, unwanted feeling\" that \"we humans have made a mess of our civilization and our planet, and not enough of us seem to care enough to change deeply enough or quickly enough to save ourselves.\" Blending insights from philosophers, poets, scientists, and theologians,  Life After Doom  explores the complexity of hope, the necessity of grief, and the need for new ways of thinking, becoming, and belonging in turbulent times. If you want to help yourself, your family, and the communities to which you belong to find courage and resilience for the deeply challenging times that are upon us - this is the book you need right now.

                "\"It's a hilarious essay collection about trauma. Yes, really.\"\u2014People Magazine    From award-winning actor and comedian Paul Scheer, a candid and hilarious memoir-in-essays on coming to terms with childhood trauma and finding the joy in embracing your authentic self.   Paul Scheer has entertained countless fans and podcast listeners with stories about the odd, wild, and absurd details of his life. Yet these tales have pointed to deeper, more difficult truths that the actor and comedian has kept to himself. Now, he is finally ready to share those truths for the first time\u2014but, of course, with a healthy dose of humor.  Blending the confident, affable voice that has won him a dedicated following with a refreshing level of candor, Joyful Recollections of Trauma chronicles Paul's often shocking, admittedly tumultuous childhood and how the experiences of his youth have reverberated throughout his life. In his comedy, Paul has always been unafraid to \"go there,\" to play na\u00efve, cringeworthy characters, imbuing them with disarming charm and humanity. That daring openness is on display in the pages of this memoir, but in true Paul fashion, it is also surprising, eye-opening, and side-splitting.  In this madcap journey through the inner working of his mind and creative process, Paul Scheer demonstrates once again that the truth is often stranger\u2014and funnier\u2014than fiction. Joyful Recollections of Trauma offers a unique perspective on universal themes: growing up, working through a challenging childhood, staying true to yourself, and finding success, fulfillment, and happiness in often strange and difficult circumstances. Throughout, Paul shares both the hard-fought lessons and the laughter that can be found in the darkest parts of life, and reminds us that what matters is not what you've been through but who you are becoming. If you loved recent memoirs by Molly Shannon, Maria Bamford, RuPaul, and Jennette McCurdy\u2014or any book that moves you to both laughter and tears\u2014Joyful Recollections of Trauma is the perfect read for you.

But the systems were never truly dismantled in our country, leaving artifacts of injustice that continue to affect every aspect of life for Black and Brown Americans. \u00a0 Many of us feel overwhelmed by the problem, unsure how we can make a difference. Yet God calls the church to stand firmly committed to racial reconciliation\u2014and for each one of us to make choices that lead to healing. \u00a0 In  Brown Faces, White Spaces,  Latasha Morrison\u2014a speaker, bridge builder, and champion for unity\u2014explores nine aspects of American life where systemic racism still flourishes, including education, healthcare, the justice system, entertainment, and the church. Through story, historical context, and present realities, Morrison looks at what it means to recognize and confess the truth about inequities in the system (preparation), commit ourselves to changing the system (dedication), and move into true freedom as a society (liberation).\u00a0 \u00a0 Drawing on rich sociological insights, as well as experiences of family and friends and from her own life, Morrison asks:  How does knowing our country\u2019s history make a difference in how we live today? How does Jesus\u2019s divine act of reconciliation on the cross lead to human liberation from oppression? How might we create systems for all to flourish?  \u00a0 This honest, hope-filled book shows us how we can reform historically white spaces and create systems that work for the good of all. Join the bridge-building movement that is listening, learning, and working together for equity in every aspect of our lives.  Includes questions for personal reflection and group discussion. "

This 25th anniversary edition features a new introduction and two additional chapters, one which provides help for pastors and counselors.   Loss came suddenly for Jerry Sittser. In an instant, a tragic car accident claimed three generations of his family: his mother, his wife, and his young daughter. While most of us will not experience such a catastrophic loss in our lifetime, all of us will face some kind of loss in life. But we can, if we choose, know the grace that transforms us.  Whether your suffering has come in the form of chronic illness, disability, divorce, unemployment, crushing disappointment, or the loss of someone you love, Sittser will help you put your thoughts into words in a way that will guide you deeper into your own healing process.  This revised edition of A Grace Disguised plumbs the depths of our sorrows, asks questions many people are afraid to ask, and provides hope in its answers:  Will the pain ever subside?  Will my life ever be good again?  Will the depression ever lift?  Will I ever overcome the bitterness I feel?  What is God's plan in all of this?  The circumstances are not important; what we do with those circumstances is. In coming to the end of ourselves, we can come to the beginning of a new life. "
