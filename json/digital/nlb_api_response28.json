What actions have they taken at the national, regional, and global level? Some important topics covered in this book include policy reforms and economic integration in South Asia, comparisons between South Asia (mainly India) and China, and economic linkages between South Asia and East Asia including the possibility of an integrated Pan-Asia similar to the European Union. Academics, researchers, students, policymakers and observers of South Asian, and more broadly Asian, economic development and integration will want to read this book. "

It explores topics relating to economic growth and productivity, the relation of technical progress to capital formation, investing in productivity growth, the relationship between technology and the cost of capital, future challenges to agricultural research, and innovation in the chemical processing industries. Industrialists and technologists, as well as economists, will find this book useful as an overview to issues of common concern.\"--Website description. "

The legacy is record government debt and low growth on both sides of the Atlantic, which is profoundly reshaping society on both sides of the Atlantic. The Legacy of the Crash brings together a stellar cast of contributors including Tim Bale, Wyn Grant and Graham Wilson to provide a sophisticated account of how the administrations are faring. They explore the impact of the crisis and assess how political leaders in both countries have responded, whilst also looking at the challenges of governing in the new 'age of austerity'. "

Drawing on three years of multimillion-dollar research into hundreds of b-webs as diverse as the Microsoft Alliance and the automotive industry, the authors illuminate the five distinct types of b-web now in play: Agoras, Aggregations, Value Chains, Alliances, Distributive Networks. Punctuating their analysis with a rich set of case studies, they provide the definitive guide to business-model innovation in the digital economy.\" \"The authors warn that participation in b-webs is not optional. To encounter and satisfy the digital customer, firms must lead or partner in one or more of these new business networks. While no single path leads to b-web success, business will adopt effective b-web strategies - or they will simply fade away.\"--BOOK JACKET.

                "Through comparative studies of aid supported infrastructure projects in East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the book examines how aid could assist development processes by facilitating development of local endogenous institutions, which are both pro-growth and pro-poor. Applying comparative institutional analyses based on the concept of endogenous institutions and institutional changes, and exploring the model of 'development cooperation', the book examines aid effectiveness in a broader context of institution development in the two regions. It offers a new perspective on the institutions-development nexus, alternative to the conventional one with its emphasis of an inevitable institutional convergence to a monolithic universal model. It argues that socially and politically sustainable development involves institutional innovation by developing endogenous institutions, firmly embedded in a local social-political system. The book offers policy lessons from the East Asian experiences with aid-supported infrastructure projects to governments in sub-Saharan Africa, the international aid community, including emerging development partners.

                "This book provides a cross-sectoral, multi-scale assessment of development-directed investments in the wider Mekong Region. The wider Mekong Region includes Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and the Chinese Province of Yunnan. This book gives important insight into how future sustainability will depend on the development of effective governance mechanisms at the level of the Mekong region. Evidence highlights a limited set of critical dynamics that generate a high level of connectivity between these countries, including human migration, natural resource flows and increasing levels of private and State financial investments. Besides regional connectivity, this assessment considers cross-sectoral implications, in particular those between the water, food and energy sectors. The majority of nationally planned and implemented development decisions in the wider Mekong Region aim for either improved water access, increased energy supply or improved food security. Investments in any of these three sectors are critical as they are closely linked, harbouring potential trade-offs and unintended side effects. Successfully managing the water, food and energy nexus demands an understanding of direct and indirect connections. A few identified connections are direct trade-offs, for example the use of water for either food or energy crops. Other connections are indirect and their estimated magnitude suggests their critical importance. Identified nexus criticalities include fish stock management, land tenure, risk management of monoculture plantations and migration dynamics. The sustainability of the wider Mekong region will partly depend on how successfully these processes can be managed. Managing nexus criticalities, in contrast to specific sectoral investments, represents an alternate and potentially effective locus of policy intervention and initiative. Using case studies that include mainstream dams in the lower Mekong basin, water diversions between Lao PDR and Thailand, investments in response to rising sea level, this volume provides critical information for researchers and policymakers. The research was generously funded and supported through the AusAID CSIRO Alliance. ",

With real per capita income growing in excess of 7 per cent per annum, together with an increased willingness to cooperate as well as compete with the rest of the world, the country is emerging as a major player in the global economy. Sixty years have passed since India gained independence, and it is a fascinating time to review the country\u2082s economic performance over these last few decades, and to assess future prospects and potential. This book contains contributions from a wide range of experts on India and explores a variety of issues, including prospects for sustained higher growth, the impact of coalition governments on economic performance, trade performance and policies, microfinance issues, agricultural pricing policies and foreign direct investment and privatization. The book provides a detailed analysis of the achievements and disappointments in the modern Indian economy, and an exploration of the issues which are shaping India\u2082s economic future. Offering a comprehensive overview of the state of India\u2082s economy in the twenty-first century, this book is essential for postgraduates and scholars seeking a greater understanding of one of the world\u2082s fastest growing economies.

The new data presented in the book sheds light on two key aspects of Singapore's economic history, namely the relationship between economic instability and growth, as well as the government's fiscal policy towards economic growth. As the first comprehensive empirical economic history of twentieth-century Singapore, this book is a valuable reference. "

The passing of the Enterprise Law in 1999, which facilitated the establishment of private enterprises, and the achievement of membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007 were two of the landmark events in Vietnam's rapid growth over this period. In order to cope with such a socioeconomic and institutional transformation, Vietnam's domestic economic entities have employed various measures, including technical upgrading, a shift into new areas of business, the diversification of capital acquisition, the adoption of new models of corporate governance, and other measures. As a result, the reorganization of Vietnam's domestic economic entities, such as the equitization of many state-owned enterprises, the emergence of large-scale private enterprises and the revitalization of rural entrepreneurs have taken place in many areas. This book attempts to analyze economic activity in Vietnam, covering a variety of types and sizes of Vietnam's domestic economic entities from large-scale stateowned enterprises to micro-scale rural entrepreneurs.

The result is a detailed examination of the scope and efficacy of changing policy regimes affecting Malaysia's post-colonial course of economic development, record of industrialization, and its relative resilience in adapting social policies to national pressures and global changes.

This book examines the interaction between European and global financial integration and analyses the dynamics of the monetary sector and the real economy in Europe. The key analytical focus is on the theoretical and empirical dynamics of financial markets in Europe, however, it also provides regional case studies of key institutional developments and lessons from foreign direct investment. There is a broad range of findings for Central, Eastern and Western Europe as well as EU Partner Countries. Crucially the analysis includes new approaches and options for solving the transatlantic banking crisis and suggests policy innovations for a world with unstable financial markets. "

                "\"Athens, Greece May Day 2010. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU) were putting together the final details of a 100-billion Euro rescue package for the country. The Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou had agreed to a savage package of Austerity Measures involving cuts in public spending and lower salaries and pensions. Outside, riot police were deployed, as protesters gathered to fight the austerity program. A country with a history of revolution and dictatorship hovered on the brink of collapse with the world's financial markets watching to see if the deal cobbled together would be enough to both calm the markets, rescue the Greek economy, and with it the Euro, from oblivion. In Bust: Greece, the Euro, and the Sovereign Debt Crisis leading market commentator Matthew Lynn blends financial history, politics and current affairs to tell the story of how one nation rode the wave of economic prosperity and brought a continent, a currency, and potentially, the global financial system to its knees. Bust: Greece, the Euro, and the Sovereign Debt Crisis is a story of government deceit, unfettered spending, and cheap borrowing. As well as charting Greece's rise, and spectacular fall from grace, it looks at the global repercussions of a financial disaster that shows many of the hallmarks of the Lehman Brother's debacle. It looks at how the Greek contagion has spread like wildfire through Europe, and, as the global financial community looks on in concern, club Med, or PIGGS countries succumb to its influence. And of course, no financial crisis is complete without Goldman Sachs and murky deals, as the author explores how speculators and derivatives traders compounded the problem. Written in a lively and entertaining style, Bust: Greece, the Euro, and the Sovereign Debt Crisis is a lively and engaging account of a country gone wrong, for anyone interested in world events and global economics.\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "Once the jewel in the crown of the formidable British Empire, India has been surrounded by myth for years. After gaining independence in 1948, this often misunderstood country found itself faced with a new sense of freedom - and along with it, enormous burdens and challenges. While exotic, mysterious, and seductive, it has also become an economic force to be reckoned with. With the fourth largest economy in the world, the largest youth population on Earth, and a thriving middle class, India is the second-most-preferred destination for foreign investment. But very few Americans truly understand what a rich and powerful country it has become - or its role as a global power, center of outsourcing, and potential partner with the United States. From the country's thriving film industry to its burgeoning high-tech industry as well as its attempts to stabilize its economy, \"India Arriving\" offers a fascinating glimpse into the real India, with all of its assets and all of its faults. Author, Rafiq Dossani goes beneath the veil surrounding India and explores the many ways it has begun to emerge onto the world stage. "
