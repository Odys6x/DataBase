Love is on the horizon...  After a very public breakup during which her ex, Caleb, tells her she is both (a) boring and (b) stuck in her ways, Savannah Moore decides that going with her mom on her company cruise to Alaska presents the perfect opportunity to show people how fun she is. It won\u2019t be easy, though. Her longtime nemesis, Tanner Woods, is also on the ship. His family and Savannah's are friends, and Tanner knows her better than she\u2019d like to admit. When he learns of her plan, Tanner wants to help, and he encourages her to try everything: zip-lining and dogsledding, hiking the bear-infested Alaskan wilderness, singing late night karaoke, and taking a polar plunge. That\u2019ll show Caleb just what he\u2019s missing. Except after spending so much time with Tanner, Savannah\u2019s not sure Caleb is the one she wants anymore... "

                "Booksmart  meets  Never Have I Ever  in this debut YA rom-com about two Korean American teens forced into a shared college visit road trip where they discover that the reasons they\u2019ve been rivals their entire lives might actually be signs they\u2019re a perfect pair.  Winter Park and Bobby Bae are Korean American high school juniors whose families have been friends since the kids were making crayon art. They, however, are repulsed by each other. Winter is MIT-bound, comfortable keeping people at arm\u2019s length, and known by others as responsible, though she has a desire to let loose. This probably comes from her rebel grandmother, who is constantly pushing boundaries and encouraging Winter to do so as well. Winter\u2019s best friend is moving abroad and won\u2019t be attending college at all, and Winter\u2019s wrestling with what it means to be left behind. Bobby is as Type-A, anxious, and risk-averse as you can get. He\u2019s also been recently dumped, which has him feeling disoriented and untethered. That\u2019s why, when Winter\u2019s and Bobby\u2019s parents insist that they go on a northeast college campus tour together, both teens find reasons to accept even though the idea of being stuck in a car together for 700 miles sounds unbearable. What awaits them is a journey of self-discovery, and the only rule on their road trip is to break all the rules. At first, this happens in hilariously calculated ways (using lists and reason and logic!), but they soon abandon that, challenging each other to dares in Virginia, getting high and wandering around Philly for food\u2014and battling the subsequent digestive distress\u2014and crashing a party in Cambridge. And, of course, realizing that they\u2019re perfect together. "

Imagine a United States in which registries and detainment camps for Muslim-Americans are a reality.  Fifteen-year-old Sarah-Mary Williams of Hannibal, Missouri, lives in this world, and though she has strong opinions on almost everything, she isn't concerned with the internments because she doesn't know any Muslims. She assumes that everything she reads and sees in the news is true, and that these plans are better for everyone's safety.  But when she happens upon Sadaf, a Muslim fugitive determined to reach freedom in Canada, Sarah-Mary at first believes she must turn her in. But Sadaf challenges Sarah-Mary's perceptions of right and wrong, and instead Sarah-Mary decides, with growing conviction, to do all she can to help Sadaf escape.  The two set off on a desperate journey, hitchhiking through the heart of an America that is at times courageous and kind, but always full of tension and danger for anyone deemed suspicious. "

Praise for  So Many Beginnings: A Little Women Remix    \"Morrow's ability to take the lingering stain of slavery on American history and use it as a catalyst for unbreakable love and resilience is  flawless .

It is also a time when his teacher measures the pupils' heads to see which of them have the most 'Aryan'- shaped heads. But when a university graduation ceremony turns into a pro-Nazi demonstration, Georg is smuggled out of Germany to war-torn London and then across enemy seas to Australia where he must forget his past and who he is in order to survive. Hatred is contagious, but Georg finds that kindness can be, too.  A companion piece to the best-selling Hitler's Daughter, this is a story of war-torn Europe during WWII, as seen through the eyes of a young German boy Georg, who loses his family and must forget his past and who he is in order to survive .

It's the perfect idea for a romantic week together: traveling across America by train.  But then Hugo's girlfriend dumps him. Her parting gift: the tickets for their long-planned last-hurrah-before-uni trip. Only, it's been booked under her name. Nontransferable, no exceptions.  Mae is still reeling from being rejected from USC's film school. When she stumbles across Hugo's ad for a replacement Margaret Campbell (her full name!), she's certain it's exactly the adventure she needs to shake off her disappointment and jump-start her next film.  A cross-country train trip with a complete stranger might not seem like the best idea. But to Mae and Hugo, both eager to escape their regular lives, it makes perfect sense. What starts as a convenient arrangement soon turns into something more. But when life outside the train catches up to them, can they find a way to keep their feelings for each other from getting derailed?   \"One of the loveliest, most touching romances of 2019 thus far that gets at the nature of something deeply buried in all of our hearts.\" \u2014   Entertainment Weekly     \"This warm, romantic, never overly sentimental story is told with humor and heart....A deeply satisfying read about a life-changing journey full of poignant moments.\"    \u2014Kirkus   , starred review.

Arthur Louis Pullman is on the verge of a breakdown. He's been stripped of his college scholarship, is losing his grip on reality, and has been sent away to live with his aunt and uncle. It's there that Arthur discovers a journal written by his grandfather, the first Arthur Louis Pullman, an iconic Salinger-esque author who went missing the last week of his life and died hundreds of miles away from their family home. What happened in that week\u2014and how much his actions were influenced by his Alzheimer's\u2014remains a mystery. But now Arthur has his grandfather's journal\u2014and a final sentence containing a train route and a destination.  So Arthur embarks on a cross-country train ride to re-live his grandfather's last week, guided only by the clues left behind in the dementia-fueled journal. As Arthur gets closer to uncovering a sad and terrible truth, his journey is complicated by a shaky alliance with a girl who has secrets of her own and by escalating run-ins with a dangerous Pullman fan base. Arthur's not the only one chasing a legacy\u2014and some feel there is no cost too high for the truth. "

A gripping YA that will appeal to fans of Jandy Nelson and Sara Zarr.   When Lexi Green's older brother, Charlie, starts plotting a road trip to find a famous musician who's been reported missing, she's beyond confused. Her brother hasn't left the couch since his girlfriend broke up with him months ago\u2014but he'll hop in a car to find some hipster rocker? Concerned at how he seems to be rebounding, Lexi decides to go along for the ride.   Besides, Lexi could use the distraction. The anger and bewilderment coursing through her after getting dumped by her pretentious boyfriend Seth has left her on edge. As Lexi, Charlie, and their neighbor Zack hit the road, Lexi recalls bits and pieces of her short-lived romance and sees, for the first time, what it really was: a one-sided, cold-hearted manipulation game. Not only did Seth completely isolate her, but he took something she wasn't ready to give up.   The further along in their journey they get, the three uncover much more than empty clues about a reclusive rocker's whereabouts. Instead, what starts off as a car ride turns into something deeper as each of them faces questions they have been avoiding for too long. Like the real reason Charlie has been so withdrawn lately. What Seth stole from Lexi in the pool house. And if shattered girls can ever put themselves back together again. "

Jeff boards the bus for the Civics class trip to Washington, DC, with a few things on his mind:  -Six hours trapped with his classmates sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.  -He somehow ended up sitting next to his ex-best friend, who he hasn't spoken to in years.  -He still feels guilty for the major part he played in pranking his teacher, and the trip's chaperone, Mr. Bailey.  -And his best friend Cannon, never one to be trusted and banned from the trip, has something \"big\" planned for DC.   But Mr. Bailey has an idea to keep everyone in line: each person on the bus is going to have the chance to tell a story. It can be fact or fiction, realistic or fantastical, dark or funny or sad. It doesn't matter. Each person gets a story, and whoever tells the best one will get an automatic A in the class.   But in the middle of all the storytelling, with secrets and confessions coming out, Jeff only has one thing on his mind\u2014can he live up to the super successful story published in the school newspaper weeks ago that convinced everyone that he was someone smart, someone special, and someone with something to say.   In her debut novel, Kim Zarins breathes new life into Chaucer's  The Canterbury Tales  in a fresh and contemporary retelling that explores the dark realities of high school, and the subtle moments that bring us all together.

A romantic and charming YA debut perfect for fans of Stephanie Perkins and Jenny Han.  Aubree can't think of a better place to be than in perfectly boring Ohio, and she's ready for a relaxing summer. But when her older sister, Elizabeth, gets into real trouble, Aubree is talked into taking over Elizabeth's summer job, leading a group of senior citizens on a bus tour through Europe.  Aubree doesn't even make it to the first stop in Amsterdam before their perfect plan unravels, leaving her with no phone, no carefully prepared binder full of helpful facts, and an unexpected guest: the tour company owner's son, Sam. Considering she's pretending to be Elizabeth, she absolutely shouldn't fall for him, but she can't help it, especially with the most romantic European cities as the backdrop for their love story.  But her relationship with Sam is threatening to ruin her relationship with her sister, and she feels like she's letting both of them down. Aubree knows this trip may show her who she really is\u2014she just hopes she likes where she ends up. "

It's jam, not blood, though I don't think I need to tell you the difference. It wasn't your wife's jam the police found on your shoe.        I know what it's like.        Mine wasn't a woman. Mine was a boy. And I killed him three months ago exactly.  Zoe has an unconventional pen pal \u2014 Mr. Stuart Harris, a Texas Death Row inmate and convicted murderer. But that's okay, because Zoe has an unconventional story to tell. A story about how she fell for two boys, betrayed one of them, and killed the other.  Hidden away in her backyard shed in the middle of the night with a jam sandwich in one hand and a pen in the other, Zoe gives voice to her heart and her fears after months of silence. Mr. Harris may never respond to Zoe's letters, but at least somebody will know her story \u2014 somebody who knows what it's like to kill the person you love. Only through her unusual confession can Zoe hope to atone for her mistakes that have torn lives apart, and work to put her own life back together again.    Rising literary star Annabel Pitcher pens a captivating second novel, rich with her distinctive balance between humor and heart. Annabel explores the themes of first love, guilt, and grief, introducing a character with a witty voice and true emotional resonance. "

But whether on land or at sea, Antsy can't manage to stay out of trouble: He quickly finds himself the accomplice of stowaway and thief Tilde, whose self-made mission it is to smuggle onto the ship and across the U.S. border illegal immigrants from her native Mexico.

                "\"High-school theater departments willing to experiment with something new might try this as an alternative to the same old reruns of Grease and Romeo and Juliet.\" \u2014Kirkus ReviewsNewbery Medalist Paul Fleischman has considered the advice of performers and producers in this newly refreshed and thoroughly updated edition of a high-school tour de force. When high school drama departments are not dusting off the old classics\u2014over and over\u2014they are constantly in search of new material. But what play could possibly suit the sound bite attention span of kids who flit from text messages to social networks throughout their day? Cue the lights for Zap, a nonstop farce that juxtaposes seven different plays\u2014performed simultaneously\u2014with comic genius. An extensive author's note provides information and insight on the plays and playwrights spoofed in Zap. "

When she first arrives at the Green Gables house on Prince Edward Island, it's everything she ever imagined. But to stay, she'll first have to convince Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert to adopt her. And that means controlling her temper (even when Gilbert Blythe calls her \"Carrots\"), staying out of trouble (and away from hair dye), and not getting too carried away with her daydreams (though she would make the perfect Lady of Shallot floating down the river). Anne might not always get it quite right, but she does keep things interesting...Through Anne's eyes, the ordinary world becomes magical and every day is an adventure. She inspires the dreamer in all of us, never hesitates to say the things we wish we could get away with, and makes us cherish every kindred spirit we meet. It's no surprise Anne is loved around the world by generations of readers.This new edition lovingly restores the original, unabridged text and includes an all-new, exclusive introduction with special memories from L.M. Montgomery's granddaughter. "

Her mother is certain studying abroad will regain Erin's chances of a good future. Once Erin meets her uninspiring host family and city, though, she's not so sure. Before Christchurch, Erin wasn't always intense and focused. When had her priorities gone upside down? Now, Erin balks at NZ's itchy school uniforms, its cold houses, and her hosts' utter inability to pronounce her name correctly. Christchurch does boast amazing rock climbing, gorgeous scenery, and at least one guy who could make her journey worthwhile\u2014if she lets him. With months ahead of her, Erin slowly begins to draw on the years behind her, one step back into her memories at a time. As she rebuilds herself from the other side of the world, she finds that although her life has been turned upside down and she's far from home, every way she moves takes her closer to where she came from.

She doesn't know the city or how she'll find Carmen when she gets there, but she has to try. If she doesn't, Maddy's going to die. On the cross-country flight, Mia figures she'll have more than enough time to make a plan for when she lands\u2014where she'll go, where she'll sleep, what she'll eat. But then she falls into an embarrassing conversation with the cute boy sitting next to her, and only after she insults him does she realize he's the one and only Jaxton Scott, the troubled lead singer of a famous rock band she hates. While Mia is running toward what she hopes is a cure for her sister, Jax is running away from his rockstar life. As the hours pass, they get to know each other, and she finds herself opening up to him like she never has to anyone. When Jax volunteers to help Mia on the rest of her journey, she's hesitant to accept his offer. Under different circumstances, she would want to get to know him better, but how can she entertain this random crush on a real-life rockstar while Maddy lies in the hospital, her name one of many on a never-ending transplant list? Though everything seems perfect while they're in the air, once on the ground again, Mia's lack of preparation catches up with her, and she receives grave news from home. Clinging to the shred of hope she has left, she accepts Jax's help but makes it clear that her priority is finding Carmen and saving Maddy's life. She will not, under any circumstances, stray from her mission no matter how cute, thoughtful, and sweet her new friend may be. "

I knew his face, but my mind couldn't accept that he was the person looking down at me. \"My real name is Alec.\"Felicity has her entire future planned. Ever since her older sister ran away, she's had the full weight of her mother's expectations on her shoulders. So she works hard to get straight As and save for college.

                "Madeline Usher has been buried alive. The doomed heroine comes to the fore in this eerie reimagining of Edgar Allan Poe's classic short story \"The Fall of the House of Usher.\" Gothic, moody, and suspenseful from beginning to end, The Fall is literary horror for fans of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and Asylum.Madeline awakes in a coffin. And she was put there by her own twin brother. But how did it come to this? In short, non-chronological chapters, Bethany Griffin masterfully spins a haunting and powerful tale of this tragic heroine and the curse on the Usher family. The house itself is alive, and it will never let Madeline escape, driving her to madness just as it has all of her ancestors. But she won't let it have her brother, Roderick. She'll do everything in her power to save him\u2014and try to save herself\u2014even if it means bringing the house down around them.With a sinister, gothic atmosphere and relentless tension to rival Poe himself, Bethany Griffin creates a house of horrors and introduces a whole new point of view on a timeless classic. Kirkus Reviews praised it in a starred review as \"A standout take on the classic haunted-house tale replete with surprises around every shadowy corner.\" "

I didn\u2019t want to rule the Risen. Wreak a little havoc upon them, though? That was something else entirely.  Bell Silverleaf is a liar. It\u2019s how she\u2019s survived. It\u2019s how all Treesingers have survived, after they were invaded by the Risen and their gods. But now\u2014thanks to some political maneuvering\u2014Bell is in the Queen\u2019s Test. She\u2019s one of seven girls competing in deadly challenges to determine who rules for the next twenty-five years. If Bell wins, she\u2019ll use the power to help her people and get her revenge on the Risen. But Bell doesn\u2019t know how much she\u2019s been lied  to.  She\u2019s part of a conspiracy stretching back generations, and she\u2019s facing much bigger dangers than the Queen\u2019s Test. She\u2019s up against the gods themselves. Getting hold of that crown might just be the least of her problems. Aboriginal writer Ambelin Kwaymullina has created a fast-paced, twisty narrative and an unforgettable heroine inspired by the strength and power of Aboriginal women. "

                "From acclaimed author Makiia Lucier, a dazzling, romantic fantasy inspired by Pacific Island mythology.    In the old tales, it is written that the egg of a seadragon, dragonfruit, holds within it the power to undo a person's greatest sorrow. But as with all things that offer hope when hope had gone, the tale came with a warning.  Every wish demands a price.  Hanalei of Tamarind is the cherished daughter of an old island family. But when her father steals a seadragon egg meant for an ailing princess, she is forced into a life of exile. In the years that follow, Hanalei finds solace in studying the majestic seadragons that roam the Nominomi Sea. Until, one day, an encounter with a female dragon offers her what she desires most. A chance to return home, and to right a terrible wrong.  Samahtitamahenele, Sam, is the last remaining prince of Tamarind. But he can never inherit the throne, for Tamarind is a matriarchal society. With his mother ill and his grandmother nearing the end of her reign. Sam is left with two choices: to marry, or to find a cure for the sickness that has plagued his mother for ten long years. When a childhood companion returns from exile, she brings with her something he has not felt in a very long time-hope.  But Hanalei and Sam are not the only ones searching for the dragonfruit. And as they battle enemies both near and far, there is another danger they cannot escape...that of the dragonfruit itself. "

Ever since cancer invaded his adoptive mother's life, Brett feels like he's losing everything, most of all control. To cope, Brett fuels all of his anxieties into epic fantasies, including his intergalactic Kid Condor comic book series, which features food constellations and characters not unlike those in his own life. But lately Brett's grip on reality has started to lose its hold. The fictions he's been telling himself \u2013 about his unattractive body, the feeling that he's a burden to his best friend, that he's too messed up to be loved \u2013 have consumed him completely, and Brett will do anything to forget about the cosmic-sized hole in his chest, even if it's unhealthy. But when Brett's journal and deepest insecurities are posted online for the whole school to see, Brett realizes he can no longer avoid the painful truths of his real-life narrative. As his eating disorder escalates, Brett must be honest with the people closest to him, including his new and fierce friend Mallory who seems to know more about Brett's issues than he does. With their support, he just might find the courage to face the toughest reality of all. "

                "A calculus nerd enlists her surly classmate's help to win back her ex-boyfriend, but when sparks start to fly, she realizes there's no algorithm for falling in love.  Marlowe Meadows understands a lot of things. She understands that calculus isn't overwhelmingly beautiful to everyone, and that it typically kills the mood when you try to talk Python coding over beer pong. She understands that people were surprised when golden boy Josh asked her out and she went from weird, math-obsessed Marlowe to half of their school's couple goals. Unfortunately, Marlowe was the one surprised when Josh dumped her because he'd prefer a girlfriend who's more romantic. One with emotional depth. But Marlowe has never failed anything in her life, and she isn't about to start now. When she's paired with Ashton Hayes for an English project, his black clothing and moody eyeliner cause a bit of a systems overload, and the dissonant sounds of his rock band make her brain itch. But when she discovers Ash's hidden stash of love songs, Marlowe makes a desperate deal to unleash her inner romantic heroine: if Ash will agree to help her write some love letters to win back Josh, she'll calculate the perfect data analytics formula to make Ash's band go viral. As the semester heats up with yearning love notes, a syllabus of romance novels, and late nights spent with a boy who escapes any box her brain tries to put him in, Marlowe starts to question if there's really a set solution to love. Could a girl who's never met a problem she can't solve have gotten the math so massively wrong?. "

Social media influencer Summer Cartwright leads a very charmed life: millions of followers, the hottest designer and vintage clothes at her fingertips, a newly minted book deal, the coolest friends, and, until recently, the hottest boyfriend at her \u00fcber-elite prep school. Every moment of her life has been carefully planned and cultivated to complement her \"imperfectly perfect\" social media persona. She is truly #LivingHerBestLife. But when Summer goes missing during her annual Halloween party and then an unscheduled post appears on her feed stating that she'll be dead within the next five minutes, those closest to Summer know something isn't quite right\u2014or on-brand. Grace, Summer's camera-shy best friend; Adam, Summer's gamer ex-boyfriend; Laney, Summer's moody camp roommate; and Cora, an influencer wannabe, all decide to investigate. And when they come upon Summer's lifeless body, they soon realize that no filter is strong enough to mask the lies we tell ourselves. Told in multiple POVs interspersed with social media posts and flashbacks, Live Your Best Lie has twists and turns that will keep readers turning the page and no one will be able to guess the ending.

Hope is dangerous. Love is deadly.   1506, Joseon.  The people suffer under the cruel reign of the tyrant King Yeonsan, powerless to stop him from commandeering their land for his recreational use, banning and burning books, and kidnapping and horrifically abusing women and girls as his personal playthings. Seventeen-year-old Iseul has lived a sheltered, privileged life despite the kingdom's turmoil. When her older sister, Suyeon, becomes the king's latest prey, Iseul leaves the relative safety of her village, traveling through forbidden territory to reach the capital in hopes of stealing her sister back. But she soon discovers the king's power is absolute, and to challenge his rule is to court certain death.  Prince Daehyun has lived his whole life in the terrifying shadow of his despicable half-brother, the king. Forced to watch King Yeonsan flaunt his predation through executions and rampant abuse of the common folk, Daehyun aches to find a way to dethrone his half-brother once and for all. When staging a coup, failure is fatal, and he'll need help to pull it off\u2014but there's no way to know who he can trust. When Iseul's and Daehyun's fates collide, their contempt for each other is transcended only by their mutual hate for the king. Armed with Iseul's family connections and Daehyun's royal access, they reluctantly join forces to launch the riskiest gamble the kingdom has ever seen: Save her sister. Free the people. Destroy a tyrant.   Also by June Hur:   The Silence of Bones The Forest of Stolen Girls The Red Palace. "

Once, Catriona Macgregor led a charmed life. Daughter of a wealthy rancher, pretty and educated, she looked forward to all the world had to offer\u2014until fate took a turn. Now family, home, and even her name have been stripped away. As \"Black Cat Whitfield,\" adopted daughter of an outlaw, she's wanted by the authorities. It certainly wasn't the destiny she imagined\u2014especially as one of the Blessed.  The Blessed, rare people like Cat, are supposed to use their gifts to carry out missions for the Patron Saints, but she can only imagine that Saint Prudentia made a terrible mistake in choosing her. Still, her gift has never deserted her. Whenever danger threatens, Cat receives a vision\u2014just in time to save her life. And when she meets a renegade priest, Father Ignatius, he helps her understand how her ability may be part of a much bigger picture. A picture that involves facing up to the monstrous Baron Caldwell\u2014the one who ordered her parents killed\u2014and his son, Adrian, who betrayed them all.  Cat is torn between guilt over her parents' deaths, a longing for vengeance against their killers, and a dismaying new interest in Adrian. It would be easiest to flee the whole situation and never look back. But as someone once told her, you can't outrun the darkness on your heels. There's only one way to break through to sunrise\u2014by turning to face the night. "

                "Acclaimed author of  Last Tang Standing  and  Lucie Yi is Not a Romantic  in her YA debut: a sharp yet sweet rivals-to-romance romp through Kuala Lumpur\u2014perfect for fans of Emiko Jean, Abigail Hing Wen, and Kat Cho.  Agnes Chan never expected to be the punchline of her own life . . . But how else do you explain getting accidentally run over and seeing a lifetime of careful preparation, endless training, and all your hopes of a track scholarship to college destroyed in a split second? Not to mention the only witness to your humiliation being your #1 archnemesis, Royce Taslim. So, when Agnes finds a new answer to her scholarship predicament in the form of an international stand-up comedy contest for teens, the last person she expects to be up against is also the last person she wants to see: Royce. Because for years Royce has represented everything Agnes loathes: extreme privilege, popularity, and physical perfection (ok maybe she doesn't hate that part  so  much). Behind the scenes, though, Royce's flawless fa\u00e7ade fades away, revealing someone Agnes never expected\u2014someone who shows her that perhaps the best parts of life are the ones you  aren't  prepared for\u2014and as the competition heats up, so do things between these two rivals. But will the pressure to win be too much for them to handle\u2014or will Agnes (and Royce) get the last laugh?. "
