                "In the first installment of a Regency romp of a series, a governess who believes in cultivating joy in her charges clashes with the children\u2019s uncle who hired her, only to find herself falling in love.   When Harry Kincaid\u2019s flighty older sister decides to join her husband on an Egyptian expedition, Harry, a former naval captain, is left in the lurch, minding her three unruly children and giant, mad dog. But Harry has a busy career at the Admiralty that requires all his attention, and he has no clue how to manage the little rascals or when his sister is coming back. In desperation, he goes to Miss Prentice\u2019s School for Young Ladies prepared to pay whatever it takes to hire an emergency governess quick sharp to ensure everything in his formerly ordered house is run shipshape again.  Thanks to her miserable, strict upbringing, fledgling governess Georgie Rowe does not subscribe to the ethos that children should be seen and not heard. She believes childhood should be everything hers wasn\u2019t\u2014filled with laughter, adventure, and discovery. Thankfully, the three Pendleton children she has been tasked with looking after are already delightfully bohemian and instantly embrace her unconventional educational approach. Their staid, stickler-for-the-rules uncle, however, is another matter entirely.  Georgie and Harry continue to butt heads over their differences, but with time it seems that in this case, their attraction is undeniable\u2014and all is indeed fair in love and war. "

But the stories we know are not the only stories to tell. There is another story, one that has been lost to the mists of time: the saga of the dark queen.  This saga begins with Yafeu, a defiant yet fiercely compassionate young warrior who is stolen from her home in the flourishing Gh\u0101naian empire and taken to a distant kingdom in the North.\u00a0There she is thrust into a strange, cold world of savage shield maidens, tyrannical rulers, and mysterious gods. And there she also finds something unexpected: a kindred spirit. She comes to serve Freydis, a shy princess who couldn\u2019t be more different from the confident and self-possessed Yafeu.  But they both want the same thing: to forge their own fate. Yafeu inspires Freydis to dream of a future greater than the one that the king and queen have forced upon her. And with the princess at her side, Yafeu learns to navigate this new world and grows increasingly determined to become one of the legendary shield maidens\u2014to fight not only for her freedom but for the freedom of others. Yafeu may have lost her home, but she still knows who she is, and she\u2019s not afraid to be the flame that burns a city to the ground so a new world can rise from the ashes. She will alter the course of history\u2014and become the revolutionary heroine of her own myth. "

The annual trip that Archie takes with his BFFs Simon and Effie holds a sacred spot in their calendars. This year Archie is especially eager to get away until an urgent letter arrives from an old family friend, begging him to help prevent a ruinous scandal. Suddenly the trip has become earls-plus-girls, as Archie's childhood pals, Clementine and Olive Morgan, are rescued en route to Gretna Green. This . . . complicates matters. The fully grown Clementine, while as frank and refreshing as he remembers, is also different to the wild, windswept girl he knew. This Clem is complex and surprising-and adamantly opposed to marriage. Which, for reasons Archie dare not examine too closely, he finds increasingly vexing. Then Clem makes him an indecent and quite delightful proposal, asking him to show her the pleasures of the marriage bed before she settles into spinsterhood. And what kind of gentleman would he be to refuse a lady?. "

                "In the vein of The Paris Wife and The Personal Librarian comes this debut novel, a magnificent work of \"biographical fiction\" that reimagines the turbulent and triumphant early years of Ella Fitzgerald, arguably the greatest singer of the twentieth century.   When fifteen-year-old Ella Fitzgerald's mother dies at the height of the Depression in 1932, the teenager goes to work for the mob to support herself and her family. When the law finally catches up, the \"ungovernable\" adolescent is incarcerated in the New York Training School for Girls in upstate New York\u2014a wicked prison infamous for its harsh treatment of inmates, especially Black ones. Determined to be free, Ella escapes and makes her way back to Harlem, where she is forced to dance for pennies on the street.  Looking for a break into show business, Ella draws straws to appear at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night on November 21, 1934. Rather than perform a dance routine directly after \"The World Famous Edwards Sisters\" number, the homeless Ella, wearing men's galoshes a size too big, risks everything when she decides to sing Judy instead. Four years later, at barely twenty-one, Ella Fitzgerald has become the bestselling female vocalist in America.  Diane Richards' Ella Fitzgerald is inspiring and intriguing\u2014an emotionally rich, psychologically complex character, a flawed mother and wife who struggles with deep emotional scars and trauma and battles racism, sexism, and colorism as she learns to find her voice on the stage. Ella takes us from the brothels, speakeasys, and streets of Depression-era New York City to the grand hotel suites where Ella, now older and wiser, looks back on her life and finally confronts the demons from childhood that torment her.  Compelling and rich in historical detail, Ella is a remarkable debut novel about an extraordinary woman. "

But writing forthright reviews of the Season's most popular plays for Mrs. Goode's Magazine for Misses, popularly known as Goode's Guide to Misconduct, is surely the next best thing.

                "Lieutenant Eli Williams was supposed to be dead. In the two years since his shipwreck, his friends and family mourned him, his brother spent his savings, and his fianc\u00e9e married someone else. So when he turns up in the middle of the London social season, he quickly becomes the talk of the town. All Eli wants is to set his life back in order and reconnect with Jane Bishop, a friend who has always meant so much more to him, before returning to sea. Jane refuses to waste any more of her life pining over Eli, who chose her cousin instead of her. She needs to focus on gaining her financial independence by establishing a ladies' gambling club. Never mind that Eli keeps trying to atone for his past mistake by bringing in new members. He's obviously keeping secrets about his disappearance, which means that she can't trust him with her heart even if she did kiss him in a moment of weakness. Or three. As Eli works to regain her trust, Jane's defensive walls begin to crumble. But when Eli faces a court of inquiry on suspicion of desertion, Jane must decide if she can let go of the past to build a future with Eli or if she's willing to risk losing him for good. "

Women from all levels of society, secretaries, teachers, and sharecroppers, work together to navigate a military segregated by race and gender. At boot camp, the \"colored girls\" are separated for processing. At Ft. Riley, the women's barracks are rustic and heated by coal-burning pot-bellied stoves while German POWs spend their incarceration in buildings with central heat and hot water.  In early 1945, Dorothy and eight hundred African American WACs cross the turbulent North Atlantic to their post in England. Their orders are to process the mail sent to GIs from their loved ones back home, an estimated 17 million pieces. The women arrive to find mail stockpiled for over two years in warehouses and airplane hangars, many pieces in poor condition, the names illegible.   In England and France, the WACs traverse a landscape of unimagined possibilities. With their outlooks changed forever, they return to the United States as the catalysts for change in America and build lives that transcend anything their ancestors ever dreamed of.   No Better Time illuminates a love of country and duty that has been overlooked until now. "

West, the Marquess of Weston, and Sophie, Lady Fitzwilliam Bridewell, have lately been spending a considerable amount of time together. But West and Sophie are not new acquaintances. In fact, years ago, they had once been nearly engaged until West's almost fatal curricle accident and his meddling father threw them off course.   Now recently widowed, Sophie has put aside all thoughts of romance. But when her widowed sister, Alexandra, mentions a fondness for an earl, Sophie realizes that she may be holding her sister back. Alexandra won't move forward with an engagement until Sophie, too, settles down again, and so Sophie approaches West with a plan. They will announce their engagement and break things off once Alexandra is happily married. It'll be simple. After all, it's not like she is going to fall for West a second time, not when Sophie has sworn not to risk her heart again. "

                "In this enchanting love story from the  New York Times  bestselling author of  Seven Days in June , a free-spirited florist and an enigmatic musician are irreversibly linked through the history, art, and magic of Harlem.   \"The book's calculus of love and loss is brutal, and grounds the dazzling prose and light magical element.\" \u2013\u2013  The New York Times      \"With humor, soulful prose and a touch of magical realism, Williams takes a creative chance with RICKI WILDE that'll make it one of your most memorable reads of 2024.\" \u2013\u2013  People     What readers are saying on Goodreads:      \"I am a Tia stan at this point. It was perfect.\"      \"Gave me all the feels, and even made me question my own personal goals.\"      \"Hands down one of the best stories of love I've ever read. A true masterpiece.\"      \"The perfect story of Black love and Black history. I feel like this book was written for my soul.\"     \"Atmospheric, haunting, beautiful, lyrical, I could wax poetic on this story forever and never do it justice.\"   Leap years are a strange, enchanted time. And for some, even a single February can be life-changing.  Ricki Wilde has many talents, but being a Wilde isn't one of them. As the impulsive, artistic daughter of a powerful Atlanta dynasty, she's the opposite of her famous socialite sisters. Where they're long-stemmed roses, she's a dandelion: an adorable bloom that's actually a weed, born to float wherever the wind blows. In her bones, Ricki knows that somewhere, a different, more exciting life awaits her.  When regal nonagenarian, Ms. Della, invites her to rent the bottom floor of her Harlem brownstone, Ricki jumps at the chance for a fresh beginning. She leaves behind her family, wealth, and chaotic romantic decisions to realize her dream of opening a flower shop. And just beneath the surface of her new neighborhood, the music, stories and dazzling drama of the Harlem Renaissance still simmers.  One evening in February as the heady, curiously off-season scent of night-blooming jasmine fills the air, Ricki encounters a handsome, deeply mysterious stranger who knocks her world off balance in the most unexpected way.   Set against the backdrop of modern Harlem and Renaissance glamour,  A Love Song for Ricki Wilde  is a swoon-worthy love story of two passionate artists drawn to the magic, romance, and opportunity of New York, and whose lives are uniquely and irreversibly linked.

                "Bestselling author ReShonda Tate presents a fascinating fictional portrait of Hattie McDaniel, one of Hollywood's most prolific but woefully underappreciated stars\u2014and the first Black person ever to win an Oscar for her role as Mammy in the critically acclaimed film classic Gone With the Wind.   It was supposed to be the highlight of her career, the pinnacle for which she'd worked all her life. And as Hattie McDaniel took the stage in 1940 to claim an honor that would make her the first African-American woman to win an Academy Award, she tearfully took her place in history. Between personal triumphs and tragedies, heartbreaking losses, and severe setbacks, this historic night of winning best supporting actress for her role as the sassy Mammy in the controversial movie Gone With the Wind was going to be life-changing. Or so she thought.   Months after winning the award, not only did the Oscar curse set in where Hattie couldn't find work, but she found herself thrust in the middle of two worlds\u2014Black and White\u2014and not being welcomed in either. Whites only saw her as Mammy and Blacks detested the demeaning portrayal. As the NAACP waged an all-out war against Hattie and actors like her, the emotionally conflicted actor found herself struggling daily.  Through it all, Hattie continued her fight to pave a path for other Negro actors, while focusing on war efforts, fighting housing discrimination, and navigating four failed marriages. Luckily, she had a core group of friends to help her out\u2014from Clark Gable to Louise Beavers to Ruby Berkley Goodwin and Dorothy Dandridge.  The Queen of Sugar Hill brings to life the powerful story of one woman who was driven by many passions\u2014ambition, love, sex, family, friendship, and equality. In re-creating Hattie's story, ReShonda Tate delivers an unforgettable novel of resilience, dedication, and determination\u2014about what it takes to achieve your dreams\u2014even when everything\u2014and everyone\u2014is against you.

Diana Boyle, a wealthy young widow, has no desire to ever marry again. Particularly not to someone who merely wants her for her fortune.\u00a0 So when she discovers that she\u2019s listed in a directory of rich, single women she is furious, and rightly so. She confronts Maxwell Dean, the man who published the  Bachelor\u2019s Directory , and is horrified to find he is far more attractive than his actions have led her to expect.\u00a0However, Diana is unmoved by Max\u2019s explanation that he authored the list to assist younger sons like himself who cannot afford to marry unless it\u2019s to a woman of means.\u00a0 She\u00a0gathers the ladies in the directory together to inform them of its existence, so they may circumvent fortune hunters\u2019 efforts to trick them into marriage. Though outraged, the women decide to embrace their unique position of power and reverse the usual gender roles by making the  men  dance to  their  tune.\u00a0And together\u2026 the ladies rewrite the rules.

                "A powerful portrait of a Black family tree shaped by enslavement and freedom, rendered in searing poems by acclaimed author Carole Boston Weatherford and stunning art by her son Jeffery Boston Weatherford.   I call their names:    Abram Alice Amey Arianna Antiqua   I call their names:    Isaac Jake James Jenny Jim   Every last one, property of the Lloyds,     the state's preeminent enslavers.     Every last one, with a mind of their own     and a story that ain't yet been told.     Till now.    Carole and Jeffery Boston Weatherford's ancestors are among the founders of Maryland. Their family history there extends more than three hundred years, but as with the genealogical searches of many African Americans with roots in slavery, their family tree can only be traced back five generations before going dark. And so from scraps of history, Carole and Jeffery have conjured the voices of their kin, creating an often painful but ultimately empowering story of who their people were in a breathtaking book that is at once deeply personal yet all too universal.   Carole's poems capture voices ranging from her ancestors to Frederick Douglass to Harriet Tubman to the plantation house and land itself that connects them all, and Jeffery's evocative illustrations help carry the story from the first mention of a forebear listed as property in a 1781 ledger to he and his mother's homegoing trip to Africa in 2016. Shaped by loss, erasure, and ultimate reclamation, this is the story of not only Carole and Jeffery's family, but of countless other Black families in America. "

Verity Hartley   always tells the truth. Well, mostly. However, when her snooty neighbor returns to their small hamlet to brag about having a grand Season, a plethora of ballgowns, and so many suitors that she cannot possibly decide which one to marry, Verity tells a lie. She claims to be betrothed. To a duke. Who happens to be her family's sworn enemy. But what are the odds that he would ever learn of this one, little, harmless falsehood?  Magnus Warring, the Duke of Longhurst, is on the precipice of marrying an heiress to save his estate from financial ruin. At least, he was. Until he hears an unbelievable rumor that he is already betrothed. To the daughter of a liar, cheat, and swindler! Needing to protect his reputation, he hunts down the culprit. And when he finds the untamed beguiler, she has the audacity to ask him to lie for her. To pretend to be her fianc\u00e9!  One week, that's all Verity needs. Then Magnus can return to his life.

He may be a tad eccentric, but he can navigate a society ballroom, and manage a polite conversation\u2014if he must. He's certainly capable of taking care of his aunt's perfectly behaved poodle, Lancelot, while she's on holiday. Elizabeth \"Bitsy\" Dockering, third daughter of a viscount, is enjoying her second spectacular Season in London. She is a Diamond of the Season and is adored by all\u2014and especially by her precious black poodle, Galahad. To everyone else, however, Galahad is a demon dog. So much so that Bitsy's most insistent beau and particular victim of Galahad's bad manners has hired a thief to steal the dog, clearing the way for his suit. But none of them can plan for a chaotic encounter in the park, resulting in lost notes, a soaking in the Serpentine, and an accidental dog swap...and Lancelot being kidnapped instead of Galahad! Determined to locate the dog, Michael isn't thrilled to be saddled with a flighty female insisting on helping, except that Bitsy has a great deal more sense than he expected\u2014and a sharp tongue to match. Still, what's a scientist to do but continue to pursue an outcome, however unexpected it may be? But chemistry is all about attraction, and this is one formula with some hilariously romantic results.

                "Clueless  meets Bridgerton in this spicy opposites-attract Regency romance told with \"self-assured style, wit, and energy\" (Lisa Kleypas,  New York Times  bestselling author).    Lady Vesper Lyndhurst is beautiful, clever, and popular. Afforded every luxury as a duke's daughter, she fills her days with friends, intrigues, and a self-professed knack for matchmaking. She may have sworn off love for herself, but she is rather excellent at arranging it.    Faced with an insolvent estate, the Duke of Greydon has no choice but to return to England in a final attempt to revive his family's fortunes. He's been gone for years, happy to have escaped his mother and the petty circles of the ton. To his dismay, not much has changed, including the beautiful and vexing heiress next door.    But when an accident of fate traps the friends-turned-enemies in an attic together, the explosive attraction between them becomes impossible to ignore and even harder to resist. They are total opposites and their lives don't align in the slightest, but fate, the ultimate matchmaker, appears to have other plans . . .    \"Refreshing, steamy, and stocked with characters you don't normally get to see in the genre\u2014a must-read author.\" \u2014Jodi Picoult, #1  New York Times  bestselling author.

Gracetown, Florida   June 1950   Twelve-year-old Robbie Stephens, Jr., is sentenced to six months at the Gracetown School for Boys, a reformatory, for kicking the son of the largest landowner in town in defense of his older sister, Gloria. So begins Robbie's journey further into the terrors of the Jim Crow South and the very real horror of the school they call The Reformatory.   Robbie has a talent for seeing ghosts, or haints.

Through his friends Redbone and Blue, Robbie is learning not just the rules but how to survive. Meanwhile, Gloria is rallying every family member and connection in Florida to find a way to get Robbie out before it's too late.

                "From Jesmyn Ward\u2014the two-time National Book Award winner, youngest winner of the Library of Congress Prize for Fiction, and MacArthur Fellow\u2014comes a haunting masterpiece, sure to be an instant classic, about an enslaved girl in the years before the Civil War.   \"'Let us descend,' the poet now began, 'and enter this blind world.'\" \u2014 Inferno , Dante Alighieri    Let Us Descend  is a reimagining of American slavery, as beautifully rendered as it is heart-wrenching. Searching, harrowing, replete with transcendent love, the novel is a journey from the rice fields of the Carolinas to the slave markets of New Orleans and into the fearsome heart of a Louisiana sugar plantation.   Annis, sold south by the white enslaver who fathered her, is the listener's guide through this hellscape. As she struggles through the miles-long march, Annis turns inward, seeking comfort from memories of her mother and stories of her African warrior grandmother. Throughout, she opens herself to a world beyond this world, one teeming with spirits: of earth and water, of myth and history; spirits who nurture and give, and those who manipulate and take. While Ward leads listeners through the descent, this, her fourth novel, is ultimately a story of rebirth and reclamation.   From one of the most singularly brilliant and beloved writers of her generation, this miracle of a novel inscribes Black American grief and joy into the very land\u2014the rich but unforgiving forests, swamps, and rivers of the American South.  Let Us Descend  is Jesmyn Ward's most magnificent novel yet, a masterwork for the ages. "

After being stranded on a very different and more perilous Earth, Colonel Lewis Cayce led his small army of displaced Americans, natives of the Yucat\u00e1n, and Jaguar Warriors to defeat the biggest host the Dominion general Agon could assemble.

But more Dominion troops have been drawn from the west to stop the Allied march on the Holy City, and a grueling race has begun. Worse, the Gran Cruzada\u2014a vast Dom army that was marching on the far Californias to eject yet another heretic foe\u2014might\u2019ve already been recalled to face Cayce\u2019s soldiers. Time has become more precious than ever, and before Lewis Cayce can even try to implement his plan for total victory, he and his force must brave their greatest challenge yet\u2014a brutal fight against a larger, better-trained army whose commander has a gift for strategy to rival Cayce\u2019s own. The struggle to keep all his soldiers alive, new friends and old comrades alike, will test Cayce like never before, and, win or lose, nothing will be the same. "

                "This program features multicast narration.  Homegoing  meets  The Mothers  where three women are tied together by blood, love, and family secrets in this searing novel by  New York Times  bestseller Denene Millner.  Raised by her beloved grandmother in tension-filled, post-segregation Virginia, Grace is barely a teenager when she loses her Maw Maw. Shellshocked, she is shipped up North to live with her formidably ambitious Aunt Hattie\u2014a woman who firmly left behind her \"undesirable\" Southern roots in pursuit of upward mobility. Thrust into the world of the Black and socially ambitious, Grace finds herself trapped in a society of stifling respectability, fancy teas, and coveted debutante balls. Feeling like a fish out of water, Grace's only place of sweet comfort is with the smart, handsome son of one of the society's grand dames. However, when Dale gets caught up in a racial police killing and Grace ends up pregnant, she is quickly hidden away and he is promptly shipped off to college. Then in the ultimate act of betrayal, Grace is deceived by Hattie, and her brand new baby girl is given up for adoption. Beautiful, intelligent and fierce, Delores a.k.a. Lolo has never had it easy. Her life has been riddled with pain and loss. Once she makes it up north, she puts aside her dream of being a model to do what she has to do to survive as a woman with little money and no mooring: get married and have a family of her own. And she will tell lies and keep secrets to obtain it. Then Lolo does have it all: a doting husband, a beautiful son and daughter, and a lovely home. When secrets start to spill out and she and her family slowly begin to unravel, Lolo is willing to do whatever it takes to keep her dream intact and those she loves together. When Lolo's headstrong daughter, Rae discovers that she is adopted, it is just one secret among others that her family is keeping. Not out of a desire to deceive, but out of a determination to survive and protect. When Rae finds out that she is about to become a mother herself, she knows that there is an important reckoning that must be faced about herself and her two mothers. Potent, poetic, powerful, told with deep love, and spanning from the Great Migration to the civil unrest of the 1960s to the quest for women's equality in early 2000s, Denene Millner's beautifully wrought novel explores three women's intimate struggle with generational trauma and healing.  A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Forge Books. "

Since the Iliad\u2014in which we are shown golden statues built by Hephaestus \"with minds and wisdoms\"\u2014humans have been fascinated by the idea of artificial life. From the Argonautica to the medieval Jewish legend of the Golem and Ambrose Bierce's tale of a chess-playing robot, the idea of what robots are\u2014and who creates them\u2014can be drastically different.  This book collects a broad selection of short stories from celebrated authors such as Philip K. Dick, Seanan McGuire, Roger Zelazny, Connie Willis, and many more. Robots through the Ages not only celebrates the history of robots and the genre of science fiction, but the dauntless nature of human ingenuity. "

Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated\u00a0neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe\u2019s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As these characters\u2019 stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive.

                "\"You may not know Marie-Louise Christophe but once you have met her, you won't forget her. Vanessa Riley's historical novel feels timely and relevant, commemorating a time when Black women were queens.\" - Jodi Picoult, #1 New York Times bestselling author    Acclaimed historical novelist Vanessa Riley is back with another novel based on the life of an extraordinary Black woman from history: Haiti's Queen Marie-Louise Coidavid, who escaped a coup in Haiti to set up her own royal court in Italy during the Regency era, where she became a popular member of royal European society.    The Queen of Exiles is Marie-Louise Christophe, wife and then widow of Henry I, who ruled over the newly liberated Kingdom of Hayti in the wake of the brutal Haitian Revolution.  In 1810 Louise is crowned queen as her husband begins his reign over the first and only free Black nation in the Western Hemisphere. But despite their newfound freedom, Haitians still struggle under mountains of debt to France and indifference from former allies in Britain and the new United States. Louise desperately tries to steer the country's political course as King Henry descends into a mire of mental illness.  In 1820, King Henry is overthrown and dies by his own hand. Louise and her daughters manage to flee to Europe with their smuggled jewels. In exile, the resilient Louise redefines her role, recovering the fortune that Henry had lost and establishing herself as an equal to the kings of European nations. With newspapers and gossip tracking their every movement, Louise and her daughters tour Europe like other royals, complete with glittering balls and princes with marriage proposals. As they find their footing\u2014and acceptance\u2014they discover more about themselves, their Blackness, and the opportunities they can grasp in a European and male-dominated world.   Queen of Exiles is the tale of a remarkable Black woman of history\u2014a canny and bold survivor who chooses the fire and ideals of political struggle, and then is forced to rebuild her life on her own terms, forever a queen.   \"A sweeping look at the political, social, and romantic intrigue surrounding Haiti's first and only queen. Riley's depiction is richly imagined and wholly original.\" \u2014 Fiona Davis, New York Times bestselling author of The Magnolia Palace    \"Queen of Exiles is the riveting account of Marie-Louise Christophe, Haiti's first and only Queen.

Lots of questions. A celebrity in her own right, Elise St. John would rather focus on sorting out Kitty's affairs than deal with the press. But what she discovers in one of Kitty's journals rocks her world harder than any other brewing scandal could\u2014and between a cheating fianc\u00e9 and the fallout from a controversial social media post, there are plenty. The truth behind Kitty's ascent to stardom from her beginnings in the segregated South threatens to expose a web of unexpected family ties, debts owed, and debatable crimes that could, with one pull, unravel the all-American fabric of the St. John sisters and those closest to them. As Elise digs deeper into Kitty's past, she must also turn the lens upon herself, confronting the gifts and burdens of her own choices and the power that the secrets of the dead hold over the living.  Did You Hear About Kitty Karr?  is a sprawling page-turner set against the backdrop of the Hollywood machine, an insightful and nuanced look at the inheritances of family, race, and gender\u2014and the choices some women make to break free of them.

With the stakes high and time  short, it seems reasonable to him that the columnist responsible should come to his rescue and marry him instead. Fortunately for Miles, Daphne is eager to escape the pressures of the London marriage mart. She agrees to a courtship. But at the end of two weeks, she intends to turn him down in a big, splashy scandal that will ruin her reputation and set her free. There's just one shocking wrinkle: Who knew being ruined by a  rake could be so much fun?. "

                "Debut author Amina Luqman-Dawson pens a lyrical, accessible historical middle-grade novel about two enslaved children's escape from a plantation and the many ways they find freedom.  Under the cover of night, twelve-year-old Homer flees Southerland Plantation with his little sister Ada, unwillingly leaving their beloved mother behind. Much as he adores her and fears for her life, Homer knows there's no turning back, not with the overseer on their trail. Through tangled vines, secret doorways, and over a sky bridge, the two find a secret community called Freewater, deep in the swamp. In this society created by formerly enslaved people and some freeborn children, Homer finds new friends, almost forgetting where he came from. But when he learns of a threat that could destroy Freewater, he crafts a plan to find his mother and help his new home. Deeply inspiring and loosely based on the history of maroon communities in the South, this is a striking tale of survival, adventure, friendship, and courage. "

On a struggling Texas plantation, six enslaved women slip from their sleeping quarters and gather in the woods under the cover of night. The Lucys\u2014as they call the plantation owners, after Lucifer himself\u2014have decided to turn around the farm's bleak financial prospects by making the women bear children. They have hired a \"stockman\" to impregnate them. But the women are determined to protect themselves. Now, each of the six faces a choice. Nan, the doctoring woman, has brought a sack of cotton root clippings that can stave off children when chewed daily. If they all take part, the Lucys may give up and send the stockman away. But a pregnancy for any of them will only encourage the Lucys further. And should their plan be discovered, the consequences will be severe. Visceral and illuminating, Night Wherever We Go marks the arrival of a bold, lyrical and powerful new voice in fiction. "

Known as Agent A, Alice is the top operative within the Agency of Undercover Note Takers, a secret government intelligence group that is fortunately better at espionage than at naming itself. From managing deceptive witches to bored aristocratic ladies, nothing is beyond Alice\u2019s capabilities.

So when rumors of an assassination plot begin to circulate, she\u2019s immediately assigned to the case.\u00a0 But she\u2019s not working alone. Daniel Bixby, otherwise known as Agent B and Alice's greatest rival, is given the most challenging undercover assignment of his life\u2014 pretending to be Alice\u2019s husband. Together they will assume the identity of a married couple, infiltrate a pirate house party, and foil their unpatriotic plans.\u00a0 Determined to remain consummate professionals, Alice and Daniel must ignore the growing attraction between them, especially since acting on it might prove more dangerous than their target.

To Marry a Duke...   Once there were three Irish sisters\u2014Gwendolyn, Dara, and Elise\u2014who had to fend for themselves when their gambler of a father disappeared, leaving them with an unscrupulous cousin. Dara hatches a daring plan: they gamble what little they own to finance a London season. Her goal: to use their looks and their wits to find a duke to marry for each sister!  It seems her crazy plot might work when the sisters are declared the \"Incomparables\" of the Season. Dukes and lords line up at their door, but bold women and scandal always go hand in hand. Particularly when Dara's plans are challenged by the likes of Michael Brogan, who provokes Dara as much as he tempts her. The handsome, clever, and rising politician is definitely not a duke, but he's determined to teach her about ambition, men, and, above all, love, making Dara wonder if her plans are about to change.

So how does the same Charles Ignatius Sancho meet the king, write and play highly acclaimed music, become the first Black person to vote in Britain, and lead the fight to end slavery?

She's gone from planning her future as a pilot-in-training to resigning herself to life on the ground. And it's all because she made one tiny, not-altogether-legal maneuver on the prestigious GAN Academy's entrance exam. It's bad enough that she didn't get into the Academy, but getting caught cheating? It's probably the worst thing Vi could imagine. Still, there are perks that come with Vi's family legacy at the school, and when Vi learns that recent pilot disappearances have left the Academy desperate for recruits, she does what any good Park would do\u2014uses her connections to wiggle her way back in. But instead of matriculating with the regular class of future Peacekeepers, Vi is forced to enter as a probationary student, which means she'll have to work twice as hard to prove herself worthy of a place in the cockpit of one of the legendary dragon mechs. Lucky for Vi, the Academy has set up a combat tournament for all students, and the prize is a guaranteed spot in the Peacekeeper corps. Unlucky for Vi, she'll have to compete against her probie classmates, including Nicholas Lee, a mysterious boy prone to throwing Vi off her game. And as more Peacekeepers go missing, what starts out as a ploy to save her reputation turns into a fight for the future of Peacekeepers everywhere, and if Vi can't master her mech combat skills, she might not survive the battle. In this standalone set fifteen years after Prudence Wu took flight in Rebelwing, a new generation of scrappy young pilots challenge corruption, competition, and more dangerous mechs than ever, as they redefine what it means to be a revolutionary.

But a taboo love affair threatens to pull her back down into the poverty and desperation that has been passed on to her like a birthright.   Eleanor Quarles arrives in Washington, DC, with ambition and secrets. When she meets the handsome William Pride at Howard University, they fall madly in love. But William hails from one of DC's elite wealthy Black families, and his par\u00adents don't let just anyone into their fold. Eleanor hopes that a baby will make her finally feel at home in William's family and grant her the life she's been searching for. But having a baby\u2014and fitting in\u2014is easier said than done.   With their stories colliding in the most unexpected of ways, Ruby and Eleanor will both make decisions that shape the trajectory of their lives. "

                "Winner of the 2021 PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction, a thought-provoking and enchanting debut about a Black woman doing whatever it takes to protect all she loves at the beginning of the civil rights movement in Alabama.     It's 1957, and after leaving the only home she has ever known, Alice Young steps off the bus into the all-Black town of New Jessup, Alabama, where residents have largely rejected integration as the means for Black social advancement. Instead, they seek to maintain, and fortify, the community they cherish on their \"side of the woods.\" In this place, Alice falls in love with Raymond Campbell, whose clandestine organizing activities challenge New Jessup's longstanding status quo and could lead to the young couple's expulsion\u2014or worse\u2014from the home they both hold dear. But as Raymond continues to push alternatives for enhancing New Jessup's political power, Alice must find a way to balance her undying support for his underground work with her desire to protect New Jessup from the rising pressure of upheaval from inside, and outside, their side of town.  Jamila Minnicks's debut novel is both a celebration of Black joy and a timely examination of the opposing viewpoints that attended desegregation in America. Readers of Brit Bennett's  The Vanishing Hal f and Robert Jones, Jr.'s  The Prophets  will love  Moonrise Over New Jessup.   \"With compelling characters and a heart-pounding plot, Jamila Minnicks pulled me into pages of history I'd never turned before.\"  \u2014Barbara Kingsolver    \"An immersive and timely recasting of history by a gloriously talented writer to watch. You will fall in love with New Jessup: the town and the book.\"   \u2014Margaret Wilkerson Sexton, author of  The Revisioners. "

As part of a large, rambunctious family, Lady Eleanor Carpenter has gained some knowledge of what makes a successful marriage.

Totally relevant to today's political situation in the Middle East and elsewhere, richly descriptive of its setting, and uncompromising in its characterizations, The Spider's House is perhaps Bowles's best, most beautifully subtle novel.

While the members of the ton, and even the queen herself, praise her warm brown skin, perfect curls, and exquisite features, Aphrodite can\u2019t help but think that living up to the  literal  goddess of beauty is asking a bit much. Her renowned loveliness certainly didn\u2019t stop the love of her life from jilting her and marrying another woman four years ago. When Aphrodite\u2019s formidable mother summons her back to London to aid in her sister\u2019s debut, she has no choice but to acquiesce. But Aphrodite is determined to ignore one man in particular: Evander Eagleman, the Duke of Everely, the man who devastated her all those years ago. Yet why does her guileless heart still flutter at the sight of him? Evander Eagleman lost his chance for true love, but now that he is an unattached widower, he is determined to win back Aphrodite\u2019s trust\u2014and her hand in marriage. But just as the couple make strides to mend old wounds, Evander\u2019s true reason for rejecting Aphrodite threatens their coveted future . . . and even their lives. "

                "A stunning novel about a mother whose dream of musical stardom for her three daughters collides with the daughters' ambitions for their own lives\u2014set against the backdrop of gentrifying 1950s San Francisco   At home they are just sisters, but on stage, they are The Salvations. Ruth, Esther, and Chloe have been singing and dancing in harmony since they could speak. Thanks to the rigorous direction of their mother, Vivian, they've become a bona fide girl group whose shows are the talk of the Jazz-era Fillmore.  Now Vivian has scored a once-in-a-lifetime offer from a talent manager, who promises to catapult The Salvations into the national spotlight. Vivian knows this is the big break she's been praying for. But sometime between the hours of rehearsal on their rooftop and the weekly gigs at the Champagne Supper Club, the girls have become women, women with dreams that their mother cannot imagine.  The neighborhood is changing, too: all around the Fillmore, white men in suits are approaching Black property owners with offers. One sister finds herself called to fight back, one falls into the comfort of an old relationship, another yearns to make her own voice heard. And Vivian, who has always maintained control, will have to confront the parts of her life that threaten to splinter: the community, The Salvations, and even her family.  Warm, gripping, and wise, with echoes of Fiddler on the Roof, Margaret Wilkerson Sexton's latest novel is a moving family portrait from \"a writer of uncommon nerve and talent\" (New York Times Book Review).

France, 1918. Nurse Marcelle Marchand has important secrets to keep. Her role as a spy has made her both feared and revered, but it has also put her in extreme danger from the approaching German army. American soldier George Mountcastle feels an instant connection to the young nurse. But in times of war, love must wait. Soon, George and his best friend Philip are fighting for their lives during the Second Battle of the Marne, where George prevents Philip from a daring act that might have won the battle at the cost of his own life. On the run from a victorious Germany, George and Marcelle begin a new life with Philip and Marcelle's twin sister, Rosalie, in a brutally occupied France. Together, this self-made family navigates oppression, near starvation, and unfathomable loss, finding love and joy in unexpected moments. Years pass, and tragedy strikes, sending George on a course that could change the past and rewrite history. Playing with time is a tricky thing. If he chooses to alter history, he will surely change his own future\u2014and perhaps not for the better.  A Macmillan Audio production from Forge Books. "

                "EVIE EPWORTH IS TEN YEARS OLDER. BUT IS SHE ANY WISER?!   Praise for  The Miseducation of Evie Epworth   'Tight, clever and riddled with wit. Like discovering  Adrian Mole  or  Bridget Jones  for the first time.'  Joanna Nadin, author of  The Queen of Bloody Everything   'A sweet, fizzy sherbet dib-dab of a book - deliciously nostalgic, hugely funny and ultimately heartwarming. The perfect book for our times.'  Veronica Henry  'Such a joyful and uplifting read. Just the sort of thing that people will want to be reading right now.'  Anita Rani,   Radio 2 Book Club  'Full of fabulous characters, sprinkled with joy and drenched in wit.'  Milly Johnson  Ten years on from the events of  The Miseducation of Evie Epworth , Evie is settled in London and working as a production assistant for the BBC. She has everything she ever dreamed of (a career, a leatherette briefcase, an Ossie Clark poncho) but, following an unfortunate incident involving a  Hornsea Pottery  mug and Princess Anne, she finds herself having to rethink her future. What can she do? Is she too old to do it? And will it involve cork-soled sandals?  As if this isn't complicated enough, her disastrous love life leaves her worrying that she may be destined for eternal spinsterdom, concerned, as she is, that ' even Paul had married Linda by the time he was 26 '. Through it all, Evie is left wondering whether a 60s miseducation really is the best preparation to glide into womanhood and face the new challenges (strikes, power cuts, Edward Heath's teeth) thrown up by the growing pains of the 70s. With the help of friends, both old and new, she might just find a way through her messy 20s and finally discover who exactly she is meant to be... "

What would  you  propose?   Clemency Fry has always been certain that marriage is a ludicrous arrangement\u2014a notion she has believed ever since reading a scandalous feminist treatise as a girl. But her outlook on romance suddenly changes after meeting the handsome Lord Boyle. With promises of a different sort of union, one with mutual respect and financial security for her family, Clemency is won over, but when the wedding is set and the plans are in motion, Lord Boyle turns cold and dismissive. Clemency fears the worst has come to fruition; she had been right all along about affairs of the heart. She has fallen into the one trap she swore she never would.\u00a0 Then Audric Ferrand comes to town seeking revenge against Lord Boyle on behalf of his sister, who also fell for his charm and wealth. Audric sees Clemency\u2019s predicament as the opportunity he needs. He suggests they join forces, a proposition that is risky and outrageous, and could possibly lead to the destruction of both their reputations. Falling in love was never in the bargain, but the season has just begun\u2014and romance is surely in the air. "

Some light romance threads through the heavier ethical questions concerning humanity.\u201d\u2014 Library Journal  (starred review) \u201cThe imagination of Silvia Moreno-Garcia is a thing of wonder, restless and romantic, fearless in the face of genre, embracing the polarities of storytelling\u2014the sleek and the bizarre, wild passions and deep hatreds\u2014with cool equanimity.\u201d\u2014 The New York Times   Carlota Moreau: A young woman growing up on a distant and luxuriant estate, safe from the conflict and strife of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. The only daughter of a researcher who is either a genius or a madman. Montgomery Laughton: A melancholic overseer with a tragic past and a propensity for alcohol. An outcast who assists Dr. Moreau with his experiments, which are financed by the Lizaldes, owners of magnificent haciendas and plentiful coffers. The hybrids: The fruits of the doctor\u2019s labor, destined to blindly obey their creator and remain in the shadows. A motley group of part human, part animal monstrosities. All of them live in a perfectly balanced and static world, which is jolted by the abrupt arrival of Eduardo Lizalde, the charming and careless son of Dr. Moreau\u2019s patron, who will unwittingly begin a dangerous chain reaction. For Moreau keeps secrets, Carlota has questions, and, in the sweltering heat of the jungle, passions may ignite.   The Daughter of Doctor Moreau  is both a dazzling historical novel and a daring science fiction journey. "

When her path crosses with Courtland, a handsome white senator from Georgia, both find themselves drawn to one another\u2014but the danger of a relationship between a Black woman and a white man from the South could destroy them and everything they've worked for.

                "This audiobook is narrated by Bessie Carter, known for her television roles as Prudence Featherington in  Bridgerton  and as Violet Woodhouse in  Beecham House .  Bridgerton    meets  Gossip Girl  with a dash of Jane Austen, in this Regency-era historical romantic comedy with a deliciously feminist twist, from a hilarious British voice, Lex Croucher.  Abandoned by her parents, middle-class Georgiana Ellers is spending the summer with her stodgy aunt and uncle at their home in the English countryside. At a particularly dull party, she meets the enigmatic Frances Campbell, a wealthy member of the in-crowd who delights Georgiana with her disregard for so-called \"polite society.\" Lonely and vulnerable, Georgiana quickly falls in with Frances and her wealthy, wild, and deeply improper friends, who introduce her to the upper echelons of Regency aristocracy, and a world of drunken debauchery, frivolous spending, and mysterious young men. One, in particular, stands out from the rest: Thomas Hawksley, who has a tendency to cross paths with Georgiana in her most embarrassing moments. Sparks fly, but Thomas seems unimpressed with the company she is keeping. And soon, Georgiana begins to wonder whether she'll ever feel like she fits in\u2013\u2013or if the price of entry into Frances's gilded world will ultimately be higher than she is willing to pay. Set against a backdrop of lavish parties, handsome men on horseback\u2014and in a time when one's reputation was  everything\u2014 this edgy, hilarious romantic comedy explores sex, consent, belonging, and status through the eyes of an unforgettable heroine that Austen herself would have cheered for.   A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Griffin. "

A Woman of Endurance, set in nineteenth-century Puerto Rican plantation society, follows Pola, a deeply spiritual African woman who is captured and later sold for the purpose of breeding future slaves. The resulting babies are taken from her as soon as they are born. Pola loses the faith that has guided her and becomes embittered and defensive. The dehumanizing violence of her life almost destroys her. But this is not a novel of defeat but rather one of survival, regeneration, and reclamation of common humanity.   Readers are invited to join Pola in her journey to healing. From the sadistic barbarity of her first experiences, she moves on to receive compassion and support from a revitalizing new community. Along the way, she learns to recognize and embrace the many faces of love\u2014a mother's love, a daughter's love, a sister's love, a love of community, and the self-love that she must recover before she can offer herself to another. It is ultimately, a novel of the triumph of the human spirit even under the most brutal of conditions. "

                "This \"exuberant celebration of Black women's joy as well as their achievements\" (Kate Quinn,  New York Times  bestselling author) novelizes the life of real estate magnate   Josephine N. Leary in a previously untold story of passion, perseverance, and building a legacy after emancipation in North Carolina.  Josephine N. Leary is determined to build a life of her own and a future for her family. When she moves to Edenton, North Carolina from the plantation where she was born, she is free, newly married, and ready to follow her dreams.   As the demands of life pull Josephine's attention away, it becomes increasingly difficult for her to pursue her real estate aspirations. She finds herself immersed in deepening her marriage, mothering her daughters, and being a dutiful daughter and granddaughter. Still, she manages to teach herself to be a businesswoman, to manage her finances, and to make smart investments in the local real estate market. But with each passing year, it grows more and more difficult to focus on building her legacy from the ground up.   \"Filled with passion and perseverance, Josephine Leary is frankly a woman that everyone should know\" (Sadeqa Johnson, author of  Yellow Wife ) and her story speaks to the part of us that dares to dream bigger, tear down whatever stands in our way, and build something better for the loved ones we leave behind.

In  Black Leopard, Red Wolf , Sogolon the Moon Witch proved a worthy adversary to Tracker as they clashed across a mythical African landscape in search of a mysterious boy who disappeared. In  Moon Witch, Spider King , Sogolon takes center stage and gives her own account of what happened to the boy, and how she plotted and fought, triumphed and failed as she looked for him. It\u2019s also the story of a century-long feud\u2014seen through the eyes of a 177-year-old witch\u2014that Sogolon had with the Aesi, chancellor to the king. It is said that Aesi works so closely with the king that together they are like the eight limbs of one spider. Aesi\u2019s power is considerable\u2014and deadly. It takes brains and courage to challenge him, which Sogolon does for reasons of her own.   Both a brilliant narrative device\u2014seeing the story told in  Black Leopard, Red Wolf  from the perspective of an adversary and a woman\u2014as well as a fascinating battle between different versions of empire,  Moon Witch, Spider King  delves into Sogolon\u2019s world as she fights to tell her own story. Part adventure tale, part chronicle of an indomitable woman who bows to no man, it is a fascinating novel that explores power, personality, and the places where they overlap. "

I'm not sure I've ever missed the world of a book as much as I miss  To Paradise  now I've left it . . .   It's rare that you get the opportunity to review a masterpiece, but  To Paradise , definitively, is one.  '   \u2013    Observer    'Awe-inspiring . . . The characters are so well drawn and the plot so well paced, I couldn't put it down.'   \u2013    Daily Telegraph     From Hanya Yanagihara, author of the modern classic    A Little Life   ,  To Paradise  is a bold, brilliant novel spanning three centuries and three different versions of the American experiment, about lovers, family, loss and the elusive promise of utopia.   In an alternate version of 1893 America, New York is part of the Free States, where people may live and love whomever they please (or so it seems). The fragile young scion of a distinguished family resists betrothal to a worthy suitor, drawn to a charming music teacher of no means. In a 1993 Manhattan besieged by the AIDS epidemic, a young Hawaiian man lives with his much older, wealthier partner, hiding his troubled childhood and the fate of his father. And in 2093, in a world riven by plagues and governed by totalitarian rule, a powerful scientist's damaged granddaughter tries to navigate life without him \u2013 and solve the mystery of her husband's disappearances.  These three sections are joined in an enthralling and ingenious symphony, as recurring notes and themes deepen and enrich one another: A townhouse in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village; illness, and treatments that come at a terrible cost; wealth and squalor; the weak and the strong; race; the definition of family, and of nationhood; the dangerous righteousness of the powerful, and of revolutionaries; the longing to find a place in an earthly paradise, and the gradual realization that it can't exist. What unites not just the characters, but these Americas, are their reckonings with the qualities that make us human: Fear. Love. Shame. Need. Loneliness.   To Paradise  is a  fin - de - siecle  novel of marvellous literary effect, but above all it is a work of emotional genius. The great power of this remarkable novel is driven by Yanagihara's understanding of the aching desire to protect those we love \u2013 partners, lovers, children, friends, family and even our fellow citizens \u2013 and the pain that ensues when we cannot.

                "The Water Dancer    meets  The Prophets  in this spare, gripping, and beautifully rendered novel exploring love and friendship among a group of enslaved Black strivers in the mid-19th century.  They call themselves the Stolen. Their owners call them captives. They are taught their captors' tongues and their beliefs but they have a language and rituals all their own.   In a world that would be allegorical if it weren't saturated in harsh truths, Cato and William meet at Placid Hall, a plantation in an unspecified part of the American South. Subject to the whims of their tyrannical and eccentric captor, Cannonball Greene, they never know what harm may befall them: inhumane physical toil in the plantation's quarry by day, a beating by night, or the sale of a loved one at any moment. It's that cruel practice\u2014the wanton destruction of love, the belief that Black people aren't even capable of loving\u2014that hurts the most.   It hurts the reserved and stubborn William, who finds himself falling for Margaret, a small but mighty woman with self-possession beyond her years. And it hurts Cato, whose first love, Iris, was sold off with no forewarning. He now finds solace in his hearty band of friends, including William, who is like a brother; Margaret; Little Zander; and Milton, a gifted artist. There is also Pandora, with thick braids and long limbs, whose beauty calls to him.   Their relationships begin to fray when a visiting minister with a mysterious past starts to fill their heads with ideas about independence. He tells them that with freedom comes the right to choose the small things\u2014when to dine, when to begin and end work\u2014as well as the big things, such as whom and how to love. Do they follow the preacher and pursue the unknown? Confined in a landscape marked by deceit and uncertainty, who can they trust?   In an elegant work of monumental imagination that will reorient how we think of the legacy of America's shameful past, Jabari Asim presents a beautiful, powerful, and elegiac novel that examines intimacy and longing in the quarters while asking a vital question: What would happen if an enslaved person risked everything for love?.

One night of slight overindulgence-oh, all right, he was drunk-and Stephen Parker-Roth finds he must betroth himself to prevent yet another scandal. But his \"intended\" is lovely, a redheaded beauty under her horrendous, unfashionable bonnet, and before long, he's congratulating himself on compromising such an excellent candidate-and anticipating what other naughtiness they'll get caught at before the wedding . . . Lady Anne Marston has long since given up any thought of marriage. That is the price she pays for the mistakes of her past. But one little conversation with a handsome rogue should never have led to a sham engagement. Even if it did end in a rather shocking kiss . . . in broad daylight . . . on the front step of London's premier gossip. Now, trapped between a secret and a lie, Anne must somehow disentangle herself from this charming, maddening man before the truth comes out-or her heart gives in . . . Contains mature themes. "

In this new mystery set in the Patty Hearst era of radical black nationalism and political abductions, a black ex-boxer self-named Uhuru Nolica, the leader of a revolutionary cell called Scorched Earth, has kidnapped Rosemary Goldsmith, the daughter of a weapons manufacturer, from her dorm at UC Santa Barbara. If they don't receive the money, weapons, and apology they demand, \"Rose Gold\" will die\u2014horribly and publicly. So the FBI, the State Department, and the LAPD turn to Easy Rawlins, the one man who can cross the necessary borders to resolve this dangerous standoff. With twelve previous adventures since 1990, Easy Rawlins is one of the small handful of private eyes in contemporary crime fiction who can be called immortal.\u00a0 Rose Gold\u00a0 continues his ongoing and unique achievement in combining the mystery/PI genre form with a rich social history of postwar Los Angeles\u2014and not just the black parts of that sprawling city.

Absorbing refugees after the American Revolution, and later the Civil War, the Draka become a people bred to rule with an iron fist. They permanently enslave the peoples of Africa, when they do not simply kill them. But this does not slake the Draka thirst for power. Sweeping across the world, the Draka empire engulfs nation after nation, shackling into servitude all who are not Draka. Europe, Asia, and finally all the Earth and its colonies throughout the Solar System fall before the might of the Draka. But empires are not faceless monoliths; they are made of individuals, complex humans with their own hopes and dreams. And so one might ask: Who are the Draka? What sort of people does the Domination rule? The Draka would have many different answers ... ... and this is their story. "
