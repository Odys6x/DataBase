                "Attention is not just receptive, but actively creative of the world we inhabit. How we attend makes all the difference to the world we experience. And nowadays in the West we generally attend in a rather unusual way: governed by the narrowly focussed, target-driven left hemisphere of the brain.   Forget everything you thought you knew about the difference between the hemispheres, because it will be largely wrong. It is not what each hemisphere does \u2013 they are both involved in everything \u2013 but how it does it, that matters. And the prime difference between the brain hemispheres is the manner in which they attend. For reasons of survival we need one hemisphere (in humans and many animals, the left) to pay narrow attention to detail, to grab hold of things we need, while the other, the right, keeps an eye out for everything else. The result is that one hemisphere is good at utilising the world, the other better at understanding it.   Absent, present, detached, engaged, alienated, empathic, broad or narrow, sustained or piecemeal, attention has the power to alter whatever it meets.  The play of attention can both create and destroy, but it never leaves its object unchanged. How you attend to something \u2013 or don't attend to it \u2013 matters a very great deal.  This book helps you to see what it is you may have been trained by our very unusual culture not to see.    Ways of Attending  is expertly read by Mike Fraser.

                "Explores the intellectual history of Americans' divergent assumptions about God, nature, and science.  Humankind has always wrestled with the existence of suffering. For two centuries, many American ministers, physicians, and scientists believed that an omnipotent and omniscient God created the world such that people might relieve suffering through ingenuity and learning. Others responded to the new worldview introduced by the scientific revolution as a threat to the divine order. In  Imagining Progress , Kristin Johnson traces the history of Americans' evolving relationship with science and religion at \"one of its most dramatic places\"\u2014the bedsides of dying children. It's here that she illuminates diverging assumptions about God, nature, and history. From Cotton Mather's campaign for smallpox inoculation to battles over teaching evolution in the 1920s, Johnson adroitly weaves an interdisciplinary history of medicine, science, theology, and activism. She follows a wide cast of characters from across theological, scientific, and political spectrums. What emerges is a portrait of diverse, often contradictory hopes and anxieties inspired by new theories of nature and human existence. Johnson also discerns a problematic pattern of invoking science to ameliorate the suffering of some children while ignoring the suffering of others. "

We're all too aware of the traffic pollution in the air, the chemicals in our water, the toxins in the soil (and therefore our food), and the electromagnetic energy emanating from our gadgets.       If we can also understand how they affect our health, not least in the worrying rises in asthma and allergies, infertility, obesity, heart disease, behavioral and neurological disorders, as well as cancer, then we can take positive steps to avoid them.       With the right information, we can:       Safeguard ourselves with protective measures   Minimize our interactions with pollutants   Ensure our bodies have the right anti-toxin nutrients   Take collective action to fight for our health and that of the environment               Backed by the latest scientific and medical research, Getting Healthy in Toxic Times will empower you to look after your own health\u2014and that of the planet.

Wildfires, hurricanes, and heat waves make headlines. But what is happening in Debra Hendrickson's clinic tells another story of this strange and unsettling time. Hendrickson is a pediatrician in Reno, Nevada\u2014the fastest warming city in the United States, where ash falls like snow during summer wildfires. In  The Air They Breathe,  Dr. Hendrickson recounts patients she's seen who were harmed by worsening smoke, smog, and pollen; two boys in Arizona, stricken by record-setting heat while hiking; children who fled for their lives from Hurricane Harvey and the Tubbs Fire; and a little girl whose life was forever altered by the Zika virus outbreak in 2016.   The climate crisis is a health crisis, and it is a health crisis, first and foremost, for children. Children's bodies are interwoven with and shaped by their surroundings. As the planet warms and their environment changes, children's health is at risk. The youngest are especially vulnerable because their brain, lungs, and other organs are forming and growing every day, and because their physiology is so different from that of adults. Childhood has always been a risky period of life; throughout history, babies and children have met peril, from polio to famine, from cyclones to war. Yet they have never quite had to face, in quite this way, the potential loss of the future itself.    The Air They Breathe  is not just about the health impacts of global warming, but something more: a soul-stirring reminder of our moral responsibility to our children, and their profound connections to this unique and irreplaceable world.

Davis, author of    The Beautiful Cure    and  The Secret Body     ________________________________________________  From a world-leading hormones specialist, the definitive book on the science of hormones and how understanding the secrets of our body's messengers can revolutionise our health and wellbeing      Hormones are the messengers that drive every process in our body. They are essential to how we grow, fight disease and digest food; why we struggle to sleep, lose weight and manage stress \u2013 and so much more. When our hormones are imbalanced this can wreak havoc on our health, leading to conditions as far reaching as diabetes, infertility and heart disease. They also influence our personalities, how we feel and even the decisions we make. And yet for too long the power of our body's messengers has been overlooked.  In this vital and myth-busting book, world-leading hormones expert Dr Max Nieuwdorp transforms our understanding of our bodies. Combining stories from his daily life treating his patients with amazing, cutting-edge new science, he reveals the crucial role that hormones play from our early years through to old age, exploring everything from the effect that smartphones have on our sleep and longevity to how our gut bacteria produce 'happy' hormones.  As Nieuwdorp reveals,  hormones are central to our moods, our relationships and so much of what makes us who we are. Demystifying the signals of our bodies, he explores how we can rebalance our hormones for happier and healthier lives.   _________________________________________________________  ' The Power of Hormones  reveals how little the Everyman understands about the extent of their powers'   New Statesman    'A delightfully readable book . . .

                "\"Indispensable . . . Dr. Beine provides a practical primer on integrative cancer therapies for children based on a metabolic framework of understanding the disease. I can't recommend [this book] enough.\"\u2014Chris Kresser, MS, LAc, founder of Kresser Institute;   New York Times   bestselling author         An invaluable, revolutionary, research-based resource for parents\u2014grounded in nutrition, detoxification, and mental wellbeing, while aiming to reduce suffering and promote long-term recovery.        \"Your child has cancer.\"       Every day, forty-three American families hear these words, thrusting them headlong into the terrifying and unfamiliar territory of pediatric oncology.       In A Parent's Guide to Childhood Cancer, pediatric oncology specialist Dagmara Beine guides readers through the most difficult scenario a parent will ever face\u2014a child's diagnosis of life-threatening disease\u2014and argues that the greatest tragedy of conventional oncology is its failure to incorporate safe, effective, and potentially life-saving integrative therapies.       In A Parent's Guide to Childhood Cancer, Beine teaches parents how to effectively incorporate these integrative therapies alongside conventional oncology, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Beine's approach is grounded in the metabolic approach to cancer\u2014pioneered by the work of Dr. Nasha Winters\u2014applied to a wildly underserved cancer patient population: children.       Topics include:       Understanding diagnoses and how to go about seeking a second opinion   Assembling a medical team that includes both conventional and integrative oncology experts   Essential tests\u2014both conventional and integrative\u2014and how to interpret them   How to develop a metabolically healthy, anti-cancer nutrition plan   Integrative therapies for specific diagnoses and reducing side effects   How to harness post-treatment detoxification and gut-healing protocols   The critical importance of, sleep, movement, stress reduction, and time outside   Plus much more               Therapies covered include:       Mistletoe   N-Acetyl Cysteine   IV Vitamin C   Cannabinoids   Glutamine   Glutathione   Low-Dose Naltrexone   Melatonin   Hyperbaric Oxygen   And more               With cancer, Beine says, there is no silver bullet. But with a metabolic approach and the wise integration of simple and effective complementary therapies under the supervision of a metabolic oncology practitioner, there is a path forward to what every parent wants for their sons and daughters: a happy childhood.

                "The inspiring story of a Black doctor who was deeply affected by the violence that plagued his Brooklyn childhood and later dedicated himself to addressing trauma and violence as public health issues  Rob Gore first encountered violence when he was beaten and robbed as a 10-year old; it was treated as an inevitable fact of life, but after another brush with violence as a teen, he began to reject that prevalent attitude. As he matured and became a doctor, he grew in his determination to find treatments for what he saw not as an unavoidable fact for most people living in vulnerable, underserved neighborhoods especially, but as a public health issue that could be addressed by early intervention and solid support, beginning in the medical community. He also became deeply involved in efforts to diversify the entire field of medicine, starting with the \u201cfront lines\u201d in the Emergency Department. Seeing his brother, Angel, and close friend, Willis, fall prey to the epidemic of violence with profound\u2014and in Willis\u2019s case\u2014deadly consequences, Rob began seriously researching the issue and went on to found an organization which is one of the models for successful approaches to reducing violence and protecting victims, who are disproportionately BIPOC, living in impoverished neighborhoods, or members of the LGBTQ+ community. Here he provides not only statistics, but stories of what he witnessed in NYC neighborhoods, in Atlanta, Chicago, Buffalo, and even in medical work in Haiti and Kenya. His work with the Kings Against Violence Initiate (KAVI) and allied organizations is a blueprint for treating violence not as a police matter, but as a public health crisis, which can and should be addressed and substantially reduced. The people he introduces us to in these pages are not merely victims, but often advocates, paving the way for eliminating the epidemic of violence in our country. "

There was a time before his wife got sick when Gonzalo could think about other things. Where humor was more than a coping mechanism. Life wasn't all about treatments and recovery, or the emptiness he felt when she died. They had kids together. Young kids. Less than a year after their youngest was born and suddenly he was strapping them both into their car seats to drive to their mother's funeral. He used to think he was the glue holding the household together. It didn't take long for him to realize how wrong he'd been. A grieving husband is in no condition to raise kids alone. There were times when he wanted to toss himself into a raging river that would suck him under and bash his skull on the rocks. That's always an option for another day. For now, he'll just squash those feelings and drive the kids to daycare. Does it get easier? Of course. But not right away. They say that hope only comes at the end of a long dark journey, but that isn't entirely true because the journey never really ends. But that means there's good news: hope is everywhere you look. "

And while highly unusual, his family is not the only one to wonder whether their heartbreak is the result of unbelievable bad luck, or if there might be another explanation. Through meticulous research and riveting storytelling, Ingrassia takes us from the 1960s\u2014when Dr. Frederick Pei Li and Dr. Joseph Fraumeni Jr. first met, not yet knowing that they would help make a groundbreaking discovery that would affect cancer patients for decades to come\u2014to present day, as Ingrassia and countless others continue to unpack and build upon Li and Fraumeni's initial discoveries, and to understand what this means for their families. In the face of seemingly unbearable loss, Ingrassia holds onto hope. He urges us to \"fight like Charlie,\" his nephew who battled cancer his entire life starting with a rare tumor in his cheek at the age of two\u2014and to look toward the future, as gene sequencing, screening protocols, CRISPR gene editing, and other developing technologies may continue to extend lifespans and perhaps, one day, even offer cures.

A former four-star admiral in the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, he served as the assistant secretary for health, the surgeon general of the United States, and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before founding the eponymous Satcher Health Leadership Institute at Morehouse School of Medicine. At the core of his impact on public health, he is also a lifelong leader for civil rights and health equity. In My Quest for Health Equity, Dr. Satcher takes an inspiring and instructive look inside his fifty-year career to shed light on the challenge and burden of leadership. Explaining that he has thought of each leadership role-whether in academia, community, or government-as an opportunity to move the needle toward health equity, he shares the hard-won lessons he has learned over a lifetime in the medical field. Drawing on his early memories, medical school days, and experience in the civil rights movement, Dr. Satcher touches on a number of topics, including the essential qualities of leadership; leading from science to policy to practice; the importance of clear communication and continual learning; the need for workplace discipline; confronting failure; team approaches to leadership; and much more.

                "Part cultural history, part literary criticism, and part memoir, A Body Made of Glass is a definitive biography of hypochondria.   Caroline Crampton's life was upended at the age of seventeen, when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a relatively rare blood cancer. After years of invasive treatment, she was finally given the all clear. But being cured of the cancer didn't mean she felt well. Instead, the fear lingered, and she found herself always on the alert, braced for signs that the illness had reemerged.   Now, in   A Body Made of Glass, Crampton has drawn from her own experiences with health anxiety to write a revelatory exploration of hypochondria\u2014a condition that, though often suffered silently, is widespread and rising. She deftly weaves together history, memoir, and literary criticism to make sense of this invisible and underexplored sickness. From the earliest medical case of Hippocrates to the literary accounts of sufferers like Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust to the modern perils of internet self-diagnosis, Crampton unspools this topic to reveal the far-reaching impact of health anxiety on our physical, mental, and emotional health.  At its heart, Crampton explains, hypochondria is a yearning for knowledge. It is a never-ending attempt to replace the edgeless terror of uncertainty with the comforting solidity of a definitive explanation. Through intimate personal stories and compelling cultural perspectives, A Body Made of Glass brings this uniquely ephemeral condition into much-needed focus for the first time. "

                "An intimate, compassionate, and expansive portrait of Borderline Personality Disorder that rejects the conventional wisdom that this condition is untreatable, told by a psychologist who specializes in BPD  Mental illness is heavily stigmatized within our society, and within this already marginalized group, folks with BPD are deemed especially untreatable and hopeless. When, as a graduate student, Alex Kriss first began working as a therapist in the field, his supervisors warned him that borderline patients were manipulative, difficult, and had a tendancy to drop out of treatment. Yet, years later, when Kriss was establishing his private practice and a borderline patient known as Ana came to his office, he felt compelled to try to help her, despite all of the warnings he\u2019d heard.  Borderline  is the story of his work with Ana\u2014how his successes with her led him to open his doors to other BPD patients and advocate for them.  Borderline  is also the story of the disorder itself: Kriss traces accounts of the condition going back to antiquity, showing how this disease has been known by many names over the millennia, most of them gendered: possession, hysteria, witchcraft, moral insanity. All referred to a person\u2014usually a woman\u2014whose behavior and personality were seen as fractured, unstable, unpredictable, and uncontrollable. Kriss guides us through this history up through the emergence of psychotherapy, the development of the modern diagnosis, and attitudes toward treatment today. "

                "Profiles in Mental Health Courage  portrays the dramatic journeys of a diverse group of Americans who have struggled with their mental health. This book offers deeply compelling stories about the bravery and resilience of those living with a variety of mental illnesses and addictions.        Several years ago, Patrick J. Kennedy shared the story of his personal and family challenges with mental illness and addiction\u2014and the nation\u2019s\u2014in his bestselling memoir,  A Common Struggle . Now, he and his  Common Struggle  coauthor, award-winning healthcare journalist Stephen Fried, have crafted this powerful new book sharing the untold stories of others\u2014a special group who agreed to talk about their illnesses, treatments, and struggles for the first time.        When Kennedy\u2019s uncle, President John F. Kennedy, published his classic book  Profiles in Courage , he hoped to inspire \u201cpolitical courage\u201d by telling the stories of brave U.S. senators who changed America.\u00a0   \u00a0  In  Profiles in Mental Health Courage , former Congressman Kennedy adapts his uncle\u2019s idea to inspire the \u201cmental health courage\u201d it takes for those with these conditions to treat their illnesses, and risk telling their stories to help America face its crisis in our families, our workplaces, our jails, and on our streets. The resounding silence surrounding these illnesses remains persistent, and this book takes an unflinching look at the experience of mental illness and addiction that inspires profound connection, empathy, and action.  \u00a0  In this book, you\u2019ll meet people of all ages, backgrounds, and futures, across politics and government, Hollywood and the arts, tech and business, sports and science\u2014some recovering, some relapsing, some just barely holding on, but all sharing experiences and insights we need to better understand. You\u2019ll also meet those trying to help them through\u2014parents, siblings, spouses, therapists, bosses, doctors, and friends who create the extended families needed to support care and wellness.   \u00a0  The personal stories they share with Kennedy and Fried are intimate, sometimes shocking, always revealing. And they are essential reading for caregivers, family members, policymakers, and the general public\u2014just as they are for those who often feel alone in experiencing these challenges themselves. "

                "This program is read by the author. From the  New York Times  bestselling author of  Black Man in a White Coat  comes a powerful and urgent call to center psychiatry and mental health care into the mainstream of medicine  As much as we all might wish that mental health problems, with their elusive causes and unsettling behaviors, simply did not exist, millions of people suffer from them, sometimes to an extreme extent. Many others face addiction to alcohol and other drugs, as overdose and suicide deaths abound. Yet the vast majority of doctors receive minimal instruction in treating these conditions during their lengthy medical training. This mismatch ignores the clear overlap between physical and mental distress, and too-often puts psychiatrists on the outside looking in as the medical system continues to fail many patients.  In  Facing The Unseen , bestselling author, professor of psychiatry, and practicing physician Damon Tweedy guides us through his days working in outpatient clinics, emergency rooms, and hospitals as he meets people from all walks of life who are grappling with physical and psychological illnesses. In powerful, compassionate, and eloquent prose, Tweedy argues for a more comprehensive and integrated approach where people with mental illness have a health care system that places their full well-being front and center.

After failed attempts with other agents, Scott developed a method to stabilize the bacteria that causes botulism, culminating in a drug that eventually became known as Botox. In Death to Beauty, Eugene M. Helveston, MD, follows the unlikely story of botulism's 1817 discovery in contaminated German sausages, to its use in military and research facilities, to Scott, an ophthalmologist who aimed to safely use the drug in humans. Scott struggled alone as an unknown in the pharmaceutical industry, searching for clinical trial financing and FDA approval, which he achieved at a fraction of the billions big pharma usually spends to bring a drug to market. Eventually, the company Allergan bought him out, capitalizing on the possibilities for cosmetic uses. Scott's formula was renamed \"Botox\" and reached annual sales in the billions. After the sale, Scott received no further compensation from Botox sales and remained the same unassuming man. A fascinating walk through the intricate history of how the world's deadliest toxin starting as a treatment for crossed eyes became a routine tool for the cosmetic industry, Death to Beauty will make you rethink success, beauty, and deadly bacteria.

In Subjected to Science, Susan Lederer provides the first full-length history of biomedical research with human subjects in the earlier period, from 1890 to 1940. Lederer offers detailed accounts of experiments-benign and otherwise-conducted on both healthy and unhealthy men, women, and children, including the yellow fever experiments (which ultimately became the subject of a Broadway play and Hollywood film), Udo Wile's \"dental drill\" experiments on insane patients, and Hideyo Noguchi's syphilis experiments, which involved injecting a number of healthy children and adults with the syphilis germ, luetin.

Yet knowing he had just a short time left with family and friends, what emerged was a great sense of resilience and motivation to take advantage of every moment. Here, Charlie reflects on his life and phenomenal broadcast career through the lense of his diagnosis, as he ponders the big questions and takes stock of the small moments that we so often overlook. Written over the course of 2022 as his health deteriorated, with the help of long-time friend and fellow journalist Ray Burke, this is a candid and unforgettable story about the triumph of the human spirit and, ultimately, what it means to be alive.

By accumulating whatever fragments she could about both phenomena\u2014images, anecdotes, and scientific entries\u2014alongside her own personal history, McCalden forms a synaptic journey of what happened to her family, one that leads to an equally unexpected discovery about who her parents might have been.

                "For those who care for chronically ill children, a new understanding of hope that equips adults to better nurture pediatric hope among sick kids\u2014articulated by the children themselves  As anyone with a chronic illness knows, hope can sometimes be hard to come by. For parents and caregivers of children with serious illness, there can be a real struggle to move beyond one's own grief, fear, and suffering to see what hope means for these kids. Duane Bidwell, a scholar, minister, and former hospital chaplain who has struggled with serious illness himself, spent time with 48 chronically ill children in dialysis units and transplant clinics around the United States. Chronically ill kids, he found, don\u2019t adhere to popular or scholarly understandings of hope. They experience hope as a sense of well-being in the present, not a promise of future improvement, an ability to set goals, or the absence of illness and suffering. With this mindset, these kids suggest a new understanding of pediatric hope, saying hope becomes concrete when they  realize community,  claim power,  attend to Spirit,  choose trust, and  maintain identity.  Offering textured portraits of children with end-stage kidney disease,  After the Worst Day Ever  illustrates in their words how sick children experience, maintain, and turn toward hope even when illness cannot be cured and severely limits quality of life. Their insights reveal how the adults in a sick child\u2019s world\u2014parents, chaplains, medical professionals, teachers, and others\u2014can nurture hope. They also shift our understanding of hope from an internal resource located \u201cinside\u201d an individual to a shared, communal experience that becomes a resource for individuals. Rich and moving, Bidwell\u2019s work helps us imagine anew what it means to sustain hope despite inescapable suffering and the limits of chronic illness. "

                "My Disappearing Mother: A Memoir of Magic and Loss is far more than a memoir on the devastation that comes with dementia, a cognitive impairment that affects fifty-five million people worldwide. Finnamore beautifully chronicles her mother's rich and varied life journey, from her birth in Puerto Rico during the height of the Depression to ferrying to the United States, in hopes of a better life. On U.S. soil, her mother, Bunny, started working as a performer for enlisted men, then became a secretary, and eventually a professional clairvoyant. With unexpected humor, Suzanne explores the feeling of love, grief, family, and loss while celebrating the bonds between mothers and daughters. In Suzanne's words, \"I want a book that attests to the fact that in a world full of disease, there is an abiding and supernatural force of love. That because of this, the sadness and the horror can be borne. That laughter can live alongside grief. That it must.\" When Suzanne's guest essay \"Dementia Is a Place Where My Mother Lives. It Is Not Who She Is\" was published in the New York Times on Mother's Day 2022, readers responded with an outpouring of empathy and love. And so this book was born, full of clues and guidance to help others feel less alone on the path that Finnamore has walked. "

                "A legendary New York Times war correspondent delivers his unforgettable final dispatch: a deeply moving meditation on life inspired by his sudden battle with terminal brain cancer.   For thirty years, Rod Nordland shadowed death. As one of his generation's preeminent war correspondents, he reported in over 150 countries, many of which were in violent upheaval,   and was no stranger to witnessing tragedy. But in summer 2019, during the height of India's erratic monsoon season, Nordland was suddenly faced with a tragedy of his own: he collapsed in the middle of a morning jog, was rushed to the hospital, and diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor.  After decades chasing conflicts across the globe, Nordland, now confined to a hospital bed, found the strength to face more personal conflicts. He reconnected with his estranged children and became closer with them than he ever thought possible. He repaired a friendship with a best friend that had been broken for twenty years. The arrogance and certitude that dominated his every action was replaced by a lucid sense of humility and generosity that persisted even after he left the hospital. Norland's tragedy became, in his own words, \"a gift that has enriched my life.\"   Waiting for the Monsoon is the exemplary story of confronting death with both eyes open, and of the human capacity to persevere even in the most difficult of times. With tremendous clarity, grace, and courage, Nordland has delivered a powerful final assignment, revealing how facing the unknown can transform experience and change our relationship to the world around us.   Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

                "Shanda Blackmon is a pioneer in thoracic surgery, a skilled professional dedicated to providing the highest quality of care. But as a young doctor early in her career, she was overwhelmed. Her team was working at full capacity, yet Dr. Blackmon struggled to meet the needs of her many patients. Then one day at clinic she noticed patients trading stories in the waiting room, sharing not just valuable advice, but empathy and encouragement. That was the genesis of the support group, a safe place where people dealing with cancer and its aftermath could talk openly about what they were going through. It was a lightbulb experience for Dr. Blackmon. Once she saw the difference a committed ally could make in a patient's long-term survivorship, Dr. Blackmon sought to extend the principles of support to her colleagues. Physicians, surgeons, and other healthcare workers endure long hours under constant stress and can succumb burnout due to the tidal wave of administrative work, patient complications, and constant pressure from administration to meet impossible demands. One doctor commits suicide every day in the United States, the highest suicide rate of any profession. Understanding and allyship can make a big difference in their lives too. An indispensable resource written by an experienced professional, The Support Group takes a candid look at the role of support in our healthcare practices and offers a workable model for patients, caregivers, and providers alike.

                "The kidney is an extraordinary organ\u2014in many ways the regulator, the metronome, the keeper of the human body's delicate equilibrium. On a given day, minute by minute, it purifies the body of toxins it encounters from diet, climate, activity, and injury. It allows us to be and to move in the world. And yet most of us know so very little about these extraordinary vessels nestled in our bodies\u2014and indeed millions of us only really learn about them when they stop working. Nearly a million Americans every year have end stage kidney disease, about 37 million have some form of chronic kidney disease. And it is an incredibly common universe of challenge and ailment that, until relatively recently, would simply kill those afflicted with it. Renowned nephrologist Dr. Paul Kimmel takes us on an eye-opening journey through the history of kidney disease, dialysis, and transplantation. Drawing on both his extensive research and decades of experience in the field, he explains the development of treatments, technologies, and medical practices that have advanced the care of patients with kidney disease. Kimmel illuminates the impact of medical advances on the lives of those suffering from this debilitating disease and offers a clear understanding of the challenges that remain. "

                "NATIONAL       BESTSELLER     The dramatic, unforgettable, and ultimately cathartic   diary of a young pediatric surgeon and mother working on the front lines as the COVID-19 pandemic hit one of New York City's busiest hospitals.  In the spring of 2020, many of us were sequestered in our homes, attempting to teach our children and learn to bake while the pings of news alerts and wails of sirens reminded us of the devastation outside. Dr. Cornelia Griggs's experience was nothing like ours.   A pediatric surgery fellow in New York City, Griggs was entering the final victory lap at the end of nine grueling years of training. She was set for a big graduation celebration and looking forward to spending some real time with her husband and two toddlers.   When COVID-19 arrived, Griggs initially encouraged her friends and family not to panic. But as mysterious cases began showing up in the hospital, and then hospital supplies started disappearing from shelves, she couldn't hold back the feeling that this was going to be worse than she had thought. Out of frustration and fear, she penned a startling op-ed in  The   New York Times  that went, for lack of a better word, viral. The piece was read by over a million people, and Griggs appeared on CNN.   Now, she is completing her story.  The Sky Was Falling  is her day-by-day account of the staggering case numbers, dwindling respirator supply, and lack of clarity on how to treat this new disease. Harrowing and deeply personal, it reads like an all-too-real white-knuckle thriller and describes how healthcare professionals went beyond what they thought they were capable of to heal their patients, and themselves.

The only person to step forward to comfort the infant as it writhed and screamed in pain during the surgery, she was shocked when the doctor said to her: \"There is no medical reason for doing this.\" From that moment on, Marilyn became an advocate for ending medically unnecessary circumcision, protecting our children, and educating parents, the public, and medical professionals about this cultural fraud and violation of human rights. She founded the National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC); organized fifteen international symposia; and became a spokesperson for promoting the genital integrity of all children. A story of determination, service, and love, Marilyn's memoir describes the myths, misinformation, and economic forces driving nonreligious infant circumcision in the United States, where it has become standard practice. Listeners may find their own beliefs and assumptions challenged, and their hearts touched by this story of a life devoted to justice for babies and the adults they will become. "

                "Marty, age 57, was given a preliminary diagnosis of ALS by his family doctor. Seven weeks later, the diagnosis was confirmed by a neurologist. Ten months and ten days later, Marty passed away.  From day one, Alison, Marty's spouse of over twenty-five years, kept a journal as a way to navigate the overwhelming state of her mind and soul. Soon the rawness of her words harmonized to tell the story of Marty's diagnosis, illness, and decline. Her journal became a chronicle of caregiving as well as an emotional exploration of the tensions between the intuitive and the pragmatic, the logical and illogical, and the all-consuming demands of being both spouse and nurse. Divided into short pieces, some of which reads as free verse, Alison's words are at times profoundly intense and painfully private.  The composition of the intricate notes of a life in its final movements includes another stanza of the journal that became Dance Me to the End: the guiding of children grappling with the imminent loss of a parent, and the shifting roles of family, friends, and community\u2014all of which add their own complex rhythms.   Dance Me to the End  is an evocative memoir about the emotional impact of witnessing a loved one suffer from a neurological, degenerative, and terminal disease. This is a detailed account of grief, shock and pain coexisting with the levity, laughter and love shared with her husband and sons in those final months of Marty's life. "

Resident: I feel I want to touch it. Me: Your heart? You want to touch your heart? Resident: Yes, but I'm too frightened. Me: What are you frightened about? Resident: Everything. People. Things. Me: What's frightening you at this very moment? Resident: (Closes eyes). That I'll never be touched again. That I won't be able to get to my heart. Me: Metaphorically? Resident: More carrots please. Whether he's initiating a coup d'\u00e9tat against new regulations with the residents, or forging a bond with the 98-year old who once called him a fat slut, Pope Lonergan's work is infinitely varied. This no-holds-barred account shows what life inside a care home is really like, for both residents and carers. Featuring night-time drama, incontinence pads and the uniquely dark humour of one double-amputee Alzheimer's patient, here you can learn everything you ever wanted to know (and a few things you probably really didn't) about Britain's care system. This important memoir challenges us all to think differently about the value of our elderly, and also the carers who look after them.

                "Penguin presents the audiobook edition of  The Butchering Art  by Lindsey Fitzharris, read by Sam Woolf.  In  The Butchering Art , historian Lindsey Fitzharris recreates a critical turning point in the history of medicine, when Joseph Lister transformed surgery from a brutal, harrowing practice to the safe, vaunted profession we know today.  Victorian operating theatres were known as 'gateways of death', Fitzharris reminds us, since half of those who underwent surgery didn't survive the experience. This was an era when a broken leg could lead to amputation, and surgeons were still known to ransack cemeteries to find cadavers. And in squalid, overcrowded hospitals, doctors remained baffled by the persistent infections that kept mortality rates stubbornly high.  At a time when surgery couldn't have been more dangerous, an unlikely figure stepped forward: Joseph Lister, a young Quaker surgeon. By making the audacious claim that germs were the source of all infection - and could be treated with antiseptics - he changed the history of medicine forever. With a novelist's eye for detail, Fitzharris brilliantly conjures up the grisly world of Victorian surgery, revealing how one of Britain's greatest medical minds finally brought centuries of savagery, sawing and gangrene to an end.

                "A New York Times bestsellerNamed one of The Economist's Books of the Year 2014Named one of The Wall Street Journal's Top Ten Best Nonfiction Books of 2014Kirkus Reviews Best Nonfiction Books of 2014Forbes's Most Memorable Healthcare Book of 2014In The Big Fat Surprise, investigative journalist Nina Teicholz reveals the unthinkable: that everything we thought we knew about dietary fat is wrong. She documents how the low-fat nutrition advice of the past sixty years has amounted to a vast uncontrolled experiment on the entire population, with disastrous consequences for our health. Dish up the red meat, eggs, and whole milk!   For decades, Americans have cut back on red meat and dairy products full of \"bad\" saturated fats. We obediently complied with nutritional guidelines to eat \"heart healthy\" fats found in olive oil, fish, and nuts, and followed a Mediterranean diet heavy on fruits, vegetables, and grains. Yet the nation's health has declined. What is going on?  In The Big Fat Surprise, Teicholz reveals how sixty years of nutrition science has gotten it so wrong: how overzealous researchers have made basic scientific mistakes that, through a mix of ego and bias, allow dangerous misrepresentations to become dogma, and how scientists who dared oppose this consensus have been ostracized. For eight years, Teicholz has pored over the massive research literature and interviewed hundreds of leading experts to unravel the shockingly distorted claims of nutrition studies. She brings these researchers to life and shows how their ambitions, loyalties, and rivalries have undermined a field of research already full of difficult pitfalls.  With a lively narrative style akin to Michael Pollan's in The Omnivore's Dilemma and the scientific rigor of Gary Taubes in Good Calories, Bad Calories, Teicholz convincingly upends the conventional wisdom about all fats. Her groundbreaking claim is that more dietary fat leads to better health, wellness, and fitness. Science shows that reducing the saturated fat in our diets has been disastrous for our health as a nation, and we can, guilt-free, welcome these \"whole fats\" back into our lives. "

                "In 1922, researchers made one of the most important medical breakthroughs of the century: insulin. Their discovery seemed miraculous. When it was given to diabetic patients on the brink of death, their condition rapidly improved. However, this was no simple cure. Injections must be taken for life. Without them, symptoms quickly return, often with fatal results. But while a lifetime on insulin poses great challenges, it also offers opportunities. In this revelatory history, Stuart Bradwel looks back on one of medicine's most celebrated innovations. Setting professional narrative against subjective patient experience, he tells the story of a drug that has challenged many of the basic assumptions upon which medical practice is built, both inside and outside the clinic. Nevertheless, Bradwel reminds us that the centenary of this apparent \"wonder drug\" should be no cause for celebration. Insulin often remains inaccessible to those who need it most: elusive prescriptions, uneven availability and sky-high prices result in rationing and desperate do-it-yourself research and development. In the face of bootstraps rhetoric and \"Pharma Bro\" capitalists, patients across the world are left to fend for themselves. There is a long way to go in the twenty-first century until insulin truly fulfills the extraordinary promises made by its discovery. "

                "USA Today Bestseller    A surprising, groundbreaking, and fiercely entertaining medical history that is both a collective narrative of women's bodies and a call to action for a new conversation around women's health.   For as long as medicine has been a practice, women's bodies have been treated like objects to be practiced on: examined and ignored, idealized and sexualized, shamed, subjugated, mutilated, and dismissed. The history of women's healthcare is a story in which women themselves have too often been voiceless\u2014a narrative instead written from the perspective of men who styled themselves as authorities on the female of the species, yet uninformed by women's own voices, thoughts, fears, pain and experiences. The result is a cultural and societal leg\u00adacy that continues to shape the (mis)treatment and care of women.  While the modern age has seen significant advancements in the medical field, the notion that female bodies are flawed inversions of the male ideal lingers on\u2014as do the pervasive societal stigmas and lingering ignorance that shape women's health and relationships with their own bodies.  Memorial Sloan Kettering oncologist and medical historian Dr. Elizabeth Comen draws back the curtain on the collective medical history of women to reintroduce us to our whole bodies\u2014how they work, the actual doctors and patients whose perspectives and experiences laid the foundation for today's medical thought, and the many oversights that still remain unaddressed. With a physician's knowledge and empathy, Dr. Comen follows the road map of the eleven organ systems to share unique and untold stories, drawing upon medical texts and journals, interviews with expert physicians, as well as her own experience treating thousands of women.  Empowering women to better understand ourselves and advocate for care that prioritizes healthy and joyful lives\u2014 for us and generations to come\u2014All in Her Head is written with humor, wisdom, and deep scientific and cultural insight. Eye-opening, sometimes enraging, yet always captivating, this shared memoir of women's medical history is an essential contribution to a holistic understanding and much-needed reclaiming of women's history and bodies.

                "For much of recorded history, people considered the heart to be the most important organ in the body. In cultures around the world, the heart-not the brain-was believed to be the location of intelligence, memory, emotion, and the soul. Over time, views on the purpose of the heart have transformed. Modern medicine and science dismissed what was once the king of the organs as a mere blood pump subservient to the brain, yet the heart remains a potent symbol of love and health and an important part of our cultural iconography. This book traces the evolution of our understanding of the heart from the dawn of civilization to the present. Vincent M. Figueredo-an accomplished cardiologist and expert on the history of the human heart-explores the role and significance of the heart in art, culture, religion, philosophy, and science across time and place. He examines how the heart really works, its many meanings in our emotional and daily lives, and what cutting-edge science is teaching us about this remarkable organ. Figueredo considers the science of heart disease, recent advancements in heart therapies, and what the future may hold. He highlights the emerging field of neurocardiology, which has found evidence of a \"heart-brain connection\" in mental and physical health, suggesting that ancient views hold more truth than moderns suspect.

                "Empty Hands  is the inspiring memoir of Zulu nurse and healthcare activist Sister Abegail Ntleko. Growing up poor in a rural village with a father who didn't believe in educating girls, against seemingly insurmountable odds Sister Abegail earned her nursing degree and began work as a community nurse and educator, dedicating her life to those in need. \"Her story tells us,\" says\u00a0Desmond Tutu, who wrote the foreword to the book, \"what a single person can accomplish when heart and\u00a0mind work together in the service of others.\" Overcoming poverty and racism within the apartheid South African system, she adopted her first child at a time when it was unheard of to do so. And then she did it again and again. In forty years she has taken in and cared for hundreds of children who had nothing, saving babies\u2014many of them orphans whose parents died of AIDS\u2014from hospitals that were ready to give up on them and let them die.   Empty Hands  describes the harshness of Ntleko's circumstances with wit and wisdom in direct, beautifully understated prose and will appeal not only to activists and aid workers, but to anyone who believes in the power of the human spirit to rise above suffering and find peace, joy, and purpose. \"Ntleko's story, which she tells in simple language, is inspiring and moving. She neither dwells in nor dramatizes the hardships she has faced, preferring instead to focus on 'fill[ing] her hands with love and then spend[ing] all that love until [her] hands are empty again.' A brief, genuine, heartfelt memoir of an awe-inspiring life.\"\u2014 Kirkus Reviews. "

                "\"Powerful, rich with details, moving, humane, and full of important lessons for an age when weapons of mass destruction are loose among us.\" \u2014 Richard Rhodes, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb     The Great Plague is one of the most compelling events in human history\u2014even more so now, when the notion of plague has never loomed larger as a contemporary public concern.   The plague that devastated Asia and Europe in the 14th century has been of never-ending interest to both scholarly and general readers. Many books on the plague rely on statistics to tell the story: how many people died; how farm output and trade declined. But statistics can't convey what it was like to sit in Siena or Avignon and hear that a thousand people a day are dying two towns away. Or to have to chose between your own life and your duty to a mortally ill child or spouse. Or to live in a society where the bonds of blood and sentiment and law have lost all meaning, where anyone can murder or rape or plunder anyone else without fear of consequence.  In The Great Mortality, author John Kelly lends an air of immediacy and intimacy to his telling of the journey of the plague as it traveled from the steppes of Russia, across Europe, and into England, killing 75 million people\u2014one third of the known population\u2014before it vanished.

                "Award-winning  New York Times  reporter Donald G. McNeil, Jr. reflects on twenty-five years of covering pandemics\u2014how governments react to them, how the media covers them, how they are exploited, and what we can do to prepare for the next one.  For millions of Americans, Donald McNeil was a comforting voice when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. He was a regular reporter on  The New York Times 's popular podcast  The Daily  and told listeners early on to prepare for the worst. He'd covered public health for twenty-five years and quickly realized that an obscure virus in Wuhan, China, was destined to grow into a global pandemic rivaling the 1918 Spanish flu. Because of his clear advice, a generation of  Times  readers knew the risk was real but that they might be spared by taking the right precautions. Because of his prescient work,  The New York Times  won the 2021 Pulitzer Gold Medal for Public Service.    The Wisdom of Plagues  is his account of what he learned over a quarter-century of reporting in over sixty countries. Many science reporters understand the basics of diseases\u2014how a virus works, for example, or what goes into making a vaccine. But very few understand the psychology of how small outbreaks turn into pandemics, why people refuse to believe they're at risk, or why they reject protective measures like quarantine or vaccines. The COVID-19 pandemic was the story McNeil had trained his whole life to cover. His expertise and breadth of sources let him make many accurate predictions in 2020 about the course that a deadly new virus would take and how different countries would respond.    By the time McNeil wrote his last  New York Times  stories, he had not lost his compassion\u2014but he had grown far more stone-hearted about how governments should react. He had witnessed enough disasters and read enough history to realize that while every epidemic is different, failure was the one constant. Small case-clusters ballooned into catastrophe because weak leaders became mired in denial. Citizens refused to make even minor sacrifices for the common good. They were encouraged in that by money-hungry entrepreneurs and power-hungry populists. Science was ignored, obvious truths were denied, and the innocent too often died. In  The Wisdom of Plagues , McNeil offers tough, prescriptive advice on what we can do to improve global health and be better prepared for the inevitable next pandemic. "

                "In the tradition of  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks , a page-turning 93-year history of Crownsville Hospital, one of the nation's last segregated asylums, told by an award-winning journalist on her decade-long search for sanity in America's mental healthcare system.    On a cold day in March of 1911, officials marched twelve Black men into the heart of a forest in Maryland. Under the supervision of a doctor, the men were forced to clear the land, pour cement, lay bricks, and harvest tobacco. When construction finished, they became the first twelve patients of the state's Hospital for the Negro Insane. For centuries, Black patients have been absent from our history books.  Madness  transports readers behind the brick walls of a Jim Crow asylum.    In  Madness , Peabody and Emmy award-winning journalist Antonia Hylton tells the 93-year-old history of Crownsville Hospital, one of the last segregated asylums with surviving records and a campus that still stands to this day in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. She blends the intimate tales of patients and employees whose lives were shaped by Crownsville with a decade-worth of investigative research and archival documents.  Madness  chronicles the stories of Black families whose mental health suffered as they tried, and sometimes failed, to find safety and dignity. Hylton also grapples with her own family's experiences with mental illness, and the secrecy and shame that it reproduced for generations.    As Crownsville Hospital grew from an antebellum-style work camp to a tiny city sitting on 1,500 acres, the institution became a microcosm of America's evolving battles over slavery, racial integration, and civil rights. During its peak years, the hospital's wards were overflowing with almost 2,700 patients. By the end of the 20th-century, the asylum faded from view as prisons and jails became America's new focus.    In  Madness,  Hylton traces the legacy of slavery to the treatment of Black people's bodies and minds in our current mental healthcare system. It is a captivating and heartbreaking meditation on how America decides who is sick or criminal, and who is worthy of our care or irredeemable. "

                "Americans knew polio as the \"summer plague.\" In countries further North, however, the virus arrived later in the year. It was described by one writer as \"the autumn ghost.\" Intensive care units and mechanical ventilation are the crucial foundation of modern medical care: without them, the appalling death toll of the COVID-19 pandemic would be even higher. In The Autumn Ghost, Dr. Hannah Wunsch traces the origins of these two innovations back to a polio epidemic in the autumn of 1952. Drawing together testimony from doctors, nurses, medical students, and patients, Wunsch relates a gripping tale of an epidemic that changed the world. Wunsch tells the true story of how insiders and iconoclasts came together in one overwhelmed hospital in Copenhagen to save the lives of many polio patients dying of respiratory failure. Their radical advances in care marked a turning point in the treatment of patients around the world-from the rise of life support and the creation of intensive care units to the evolution of rehabilitation medicine. The Autumn Ghost will leave listeners in awe of the courage of those who battled the polio epidemic, and grateful for the modern medical care they pioneered. "

Uch\u00e9 Blackstock is a force of nature.\u201d\u00a0\u2014Abraham Verghese, MD,  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Covenant of Water     \u201c[An] extraordinary family story.\u201d\u00a0\u2014Dr. Damon\u00a0Tweedy,  The New York Times Book Review     \u201cThis book should be required reading for all medical students.\u201d \u2014Gayle King,  CBS Mornings     The rousing, captivating story of a Black physician, her career in medicine, and the deep inequities that still exist in the U.S. healthcare system  Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, it never occurred to Uch\u00e9 Blackstock and her twin sister, Oni, that they would be anything  but  physicians. In the 1980s, their mother headed an organization of Black women physicians, and for years the girls watched these fiercely intelligent women in white coats tend to their patients and neighbors, host community health fairs, cure ills, and save lives. What Dr. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock did not understand as a child\u2014or learn about at Harvard Medical School, where she and her sister had followed in their mother\u2019s footsteps, making them the first Black mother-daughter legacies from the school\u2014were the profound and long-standing systemic inequities that mean just 2 percent of all U.S. physicians today are Black women; the racist practices and policies that ensure Black Americans have far worse health outcomes than any other group in the country; and the flawed system that endangers the well-being of communities like theirs. As an ER physician, and later as a professor in academic medicine, Dr. Blackstock became profoundly aware of the systemic barriers that Black patients and physicians continue to face.  Legacy    is a journey through the critical intersection of racism and healthcare. At once a searing indictment of our healthcare system, a generational family memoir, and a call to action,  Legacy  is Dr. Blackstock\u2019s odyssey from child to medical student to practicing physician\u2014to finally seizing her own power as a health equity advocate against the backdrop of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.

                "Allie Cashel has suffered from chronic Lyme disease for sixteen years\u2014but much of the medical community refuses to recognize her symptoms as the result of infectious disease. In  Suffering the Silence: Chronic Lyme Disease in an Age of Denial,  Cashel paints a living portrait of what is often called post-treatment Lyme syndrome, featuring the stories of chronic Lyme patients from around the world and their struggle for recognition and treatment.  In the United States alone, at least 300,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year, and it is estimated that 20 percent of them go on to develop chronic symptoms of the disease, including (but not limited to) muscle and joint pain; digestive problems; extreme fatigue, confusion, and dizziness; sensations of burning and numbness; and immune-system dysfunction. Before reaching a final diagnosis, many of these patients are misdiagnosed with diseases and conditions like lupus, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, anxiety, and even dementia. Despite these numbers and routine misdiagnoses, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)\u00a0claim it is impossible for the Lyme bacteria to survive in the body after standard antibiotic therapy. For these chronic patients who have their suffering routinely dismissed by doctors\u2014and even family and friends\u2014the social effects of the illness can be as crippling as the disease itself.  Suffering the Silence  is a personal and provocative call to break the stigma and ignorance that currently surrounds chronic Lyme disease and other misunderstood chronic illnesses\u2014but it is also a message of hope and comfort for Lyme sufferers, encouraging them to share their stories, seek out treatment, and remember that they are not alone.

Should we all be entitled to timely mental health therapy? How should we care for our old? As we grapple with the world's worst pandemic for a century, our minds are on our health more than ever. But what should we rightfully expect of doctors? In this original and thought-provoking book, Sir David Haslam explores what good healthcare should achieve and asks how we pay for it. Informed by patient stories and data from across the world - from US big pharma to Britain's NHS - this is an urgent and often moving examination of our most important asset: our health. "

A good trauma surgeon must be a conductor presiding over an orchestra of healthcare providers as their patients cling to life by a thread. They are also a steely quarterback who can't be rattled when they throw an interception\u2014lingering on a past failure would only ruin their ability to care for the next patient, and the next. They have an encyclopedic knowledge of medical science and are practiced in the art of instinctively reacting to whatever emergency comes flying at them on a stretcher, in addition to doing anything they can to comfort patients' distraught families and friends. All Bleeding Stops gives listeners an intimate look at what goes on inside a trauma center, highlighting injuries sustained in car crashes, shootings, and stabbings\u2014basically anything bleeding, obstructed, or perforated. Having lived and breathed trauma for four decades, Dr. Cohn is an ideal guide to demystify the role of the trauma surgeon and their place in a hospital. The behind-the-scenes look he provides is infused with sobering tales from his career as a military surgeon and in trauma centers across the country as well as his descriptions of high-profile medical stories.

From conducting farm animal caesarean sections in the early hours to missing family plans in order to treat critically injured pet dogs, no two days in the work of vet Guy Gordon and his team are ever the same. Based in Thurso, northern Scotland, the small group of vets and their supporting staff cover a vast area of more than one thousand square miles. The incredibly wild and rural landscape in which they operate brings a huge variety of work depending on the seasons, with the delivery of new-born lambs and calves in the spring, and the arrival of seal pups to the northern Scottish coast starting in the autumn months.  The Highland Vet  shows what working in one of Britain's most beautiful and remote locations really involves. Inside, Guy and his team share the high and lows, up and downs and ins and outs of their daily work throughout the course of a year, making this a truly magical celebration of Scotland's northern highlands, as well as the animals and people who call the region home. \u00a9 Guy Gordon & The Thurso Veterinary Team 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022.

But it's one that goes unanswered in hospitals, clinics, and long-term care homes across the country.  Code White  exposes a shocking epidemic of violence that's hidden in plain sight, one in which workers are bruised, battered, assaulted, and demeaned, but carry on in silence, with little recourse or support.   Researchers Margaret M. Keith and James T. Brophy lay bare the stories of over one hundred nurses and personal support workers, aides and porters, clerical workers and cleaners. The nightmarish experiences they relate are not one-off incidents, but symptoms of deep systemic flaws that have transformed health care into one of the most dangerous occupational sectors in Canada.   The same questions echo in the wake of each and every brutal encounter: Is violence and trauma really just \"part of the job\"? Why is this going underreported and unchecked? What needs to be done, and how?. "

A difficult, deeply personal story beautifully told.'  \u2013 George Caulkin,  The Athletic   \u2014\u2014    From the author of the critically acclaimed memoir,  The Boy on the Shed , comes a powerful tale of grit and resilience, told with great humour, openness and profound bravery.  Former Newcastle United winger Paul Ferris was 51. He had successfully forged a post-football career as a physio, barrister and then a CEO, and his award-winning memoir,  The Boy on the Shed , was just about to be published. But then he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. This honest, sometimes brutal and frequently funny book tells the story of what happened next.  Prostate cancer . It's a phrase that strikes fear into the heart of every man. It's the most common male cancer, but treatable if it's caught early enough. Paul doesn't shy away from describing that treatment. And neither does he hold back on its life-changing consequences \u2013 from harrowing surgery, humiliating procedures and excruciating consultations \u2013 as he strives to become the man he once was again. The mental challenges and psychological impact of living with this acute condition are explored in Paul's revealing and riveting narrative that represents rare male honesty, but this is never a 'poor me' book or not in any way self-pitying. Courageous, inspirational and beautifully written,  The   Magic in the Tin  is a rare thing: deeply moving yet rich in humour, written by a true sportsman in every sense of the word. A brutal and poignant account of one man's journey through prostate cancer. "

                "The story of maverick scientist Candace Pert, whose groundbreaking research introduced the world to the mind-body connection, opioid receptors, and peptide T, and her fight for recognition in a toxic healthcare system.   Candace Pert stood at the dawn of three revolutions: the women's movement, integrative health, and psychopharmacology. A scientific prodigy, she was 30 years ahead of her time, preaching a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to healthcare and medicine long before yoga hit the mainstream and \"wellness\" took root in our vernacular. Her bestselling book  Molecules of Emotion  made her the mother of the Mind/Body Revolution, launching a paradigm shift in medicine. Deepak Chopra credits her with creating his career, and he said as much in his eulogy at her funeral.    Candace began her career as an unbridled maverick. In 1972, as a 26-year-old graduate student at Johns Hopkins, she discovered the opiate receptor, revolutionizing her field and enabling pharmacologists to design new classifications of drugs from Prozac to Viagra to Percocet and OxyContin. The tragic irony of her breakthrough, touted as the first step to end heroin addiction, is that it helped spawn a virulent epidemic of drug dependence. Facing the largest public health crisis of the 21st century, Candace was incensed that the Hippocratic oath\u2014\"first, do no harm\"\u2014would succumb to greed, and as witness to this abuse of power, she was one of few scientists courageous enough to protest.    Later, as Chief of Brain Biochemistry at the National Institutes of Health, Candace created Peptide T, the non-toxic treatment for HIV featured in  Dallas Buyers  Club . As the AIDS pandemic raged, triggering panic across Reagan-era America, the U.S. government poured massive amounts of money into finding a cure, sparking a battle among scientists for funding and power. Bested by rivals with competing drugs yet desperate to help, Candace went rogue, becoming a lynchpin in the black market for Peptide T.    After a scandalous departure from her tenured position at the NIH, Candace launched a series of private companies with Michael Ruff, her second husband and collaborator. Na\u00efve to the world of business, she was manipulated by investors keen to wrest control of her discoveries. But Candace too became tainted, believing that her noble ends would justify devious means. Like a mythic hero, she succumbed to a fatal flaw, and her greatest strengths\u2014singularity of purpose and blind faith in her own virtuosity\u2014would prove to be her undoing. "

In this ground-breaking book, neuroscientist Camilla Nord offers a fascinating tour of the scientific and technological developments that are revolutionizing the way we think about mental health, showing why and how events - and treatments - can affect people in such different ways. In  The Balanced Brain , Nord reveals how the small things we do to lift our mood during the course of a day - a piece of chocolate, a coffee, chatting to a friend - often work on the same pathways in our brain as the latest pharmacological treatments for mental health disorders. Whether they help us to manage pain, learn from experience or expend energy on the things that are important for our survival, these conscious actions are part of a complex self-regulating process that is unique to each individual and the constant backdrop to our everyday lives. With so many factors at play, there are more possibilities for recovery and resilience than we might think. \u00a92023 Camilla Nord (P)2023 Penguin Audio. "

                "The concept of the intact mind, first described in a 2006 memoir, refers to the idea that inside every autistic child is an intelligent, typical child waiting to be liberated by the right diet, the right treatment intervention, the right combination of supports and accommodations. The sentiment itself is not new. Though the idea gives hope to parents devastated by a child's diagnosis, Amy Lutz argues that it has also contributed to widespread dismantling of services badly needed by severely disabled children and their families. In Chasing the Intact Mind, Lutz traces the history of the intact mind concept, explaining how it influences current policy and practice affecting those with autism. Lutz provides a historical analysis of the intact mind narrative and describes how the concept-originally unique to autism-has come to inform current debates at the heart of intellectual and developmental disability practice and policy in the United States. Lutz argues that focusing on the intact mind and marginalizing those with severe disability reproduces historic patterns of discrimination that yoked human worth to intelligence, and that it is only by making space for the impaired mind that we will be able to resolve these ongoing clashes-as well as even larger questions of personhood, dependency, and care.

Late one night, while Rebecca Fogg was alone in her apartment, her hand was partially amputated in an explosion. Quick thinking saved her life, but the journey to recovery would be a slow one. As the doctors rebuilt her hand, Rebecca (who also survived 9/11) began rebuilding her sense of self by studying the physical and psychological process of recovery. Interspersing the personal with the medical, Rebecca charts her year of rehabilitation, touching on the marvelously adaptable anatomy of the hand; how the brain's fight-or-flight mechanism enables us to react instantly to danger; and why trauma causes some people to develop PTSD and gives others a whole new lease on life. Told with emotional and intellectual clarity, Beautiful Trauma is a celebration of the resilience of the human spirit and the power we all hold in our hands. "

                "From an eminent surgeon and historian comes the \"by turns fascinating and ghastly\"  (The   New York Times Book Review , Editors' Choice) story of surgery's development\u2014from the Stone Age to the present day\u2014blending meticulous medical research with vivid storytelling.  There are not many life events that can be as simultaneously frightening and hopeful as a surgical operation. In America, tens-of-millions of major surgical procedures are performed annually, yet few of us consider the magnitude of these figures because we have such inherent confidence in surgeons. And, despite passionate debates about health care and the media's endless fascination with surgery, most of us have no idea how the first surgeons came to be because the story of surgery has never been fully told. Now,  Empire of the Scalpel  elegantly reveals surgery's fascinating evolution from its early roots in ancient Egypt to its refinement in Europe and rise to scientific dominance in the United States.   From the 16th-century saga of Andreas Vesalius and his crusade to accurately describe human anatomy while appeasing the conservative clergy who clamored for his burning at the stake, to the hard-to-believe story of late-19th century surgeons' apathy to Joseph Lister's innovation of antisepsis and how this indifference led to thousands of unnecessary surgical deaths,  Empire of the Scalpel  is both a global history and a uniquely American tale. You'll discover how in the 20th century the US achieved surgical leadership, heralded by Harvard's Joseph Murray and his Nobel Prize\u2013winning, seemingly impossible feat of transplanting a kidney, which ushered in a new era of transplants that continues to make procedures once thought insurmountable into achievable successes.   Today, the list of possible operations is almost infinite\u2014from knee and hip replacement to heart bypass and transplants to fat reduction and rhinoplasty\u2014and \"Rutkow has a raconteur's touch\" ( San Francisco Chronicle ) as he draws on his five-decade career to show us how we got here. Comprehensive, authoritative, and captivating,  Empire of the Scalpel  is \"a fascinating, well-rendered story of how the once-impossible became a daily reality\" ( Kirkus Reviews , starred review).

Travelling from the rainforests of Sierra Leone to the jungles of Borneo, Romain Pizzi has caught, anaesthetised, diagnosed, operated on, medicated, and then released some of the world's most endangered wild animals. From disease testing Polynesian snails to keyhole surgery in Sumatran orangutans; from endoscopy in sharks to ultrasound on a chimpanzee. Sometimes this is high tech work, such as the first robotic surgery in a tiger, or giant panda cloning attempts. Sometimes the situations are more primitive, from anaesthetising a bear with a bicycle pump, old plumbing tubes and a plank, to operating on a vulture using an old metal spoon. In Exotic Vetting, Romain recalls his many interesting patients, while taking readers on a tour of the challenges of treating the world's amazing spectrum of wild animal species. "

                "From a childhood marked by loneliness and want, M. Roy Wilson forged an extraordinary life of accomplishment and acclaim. His accomplishments include the presidencies of four universities, dean of two medical schools, and deputy director of one of the National Institutes of Health' s twenty-seven Centers and Institutes. Through this inspiring and deeply personal story of struggle and success, Wilson shares insights gleaned through his life experiences, many of which helped others reach their highest potential as students, faculty, physicians and people. Born to a Japanese mother and Black father, much of M. Roy Wilson' s childhood in Japan was marked by parental absence, sexual abuse, extended periods as a runaway, physical confrontations and frequent moves. He was often forced to play the role of caregiver to his younger sister, and together they grew to depend on each other for support until their teenage years. Under the guidance of his high school English teacher, Wilson turned his life around and obtained an MD from Harvard Medical School. His adult life as a physician was ironically beset with significant health challenges, including diagnoses of cardiomyopathy that rendered him uninsurable, a potentially blinding eye disease, and cancer that at first was thought to be terminal. Having developed a veneer of invulnerability as a child, he kept these medical diagnoses a secret until now. Like the plum tree that blooms even during dark and dreary times, Wilson overcame his childhood challenges and later, his health issues, to achieve distinction in medicine, higher education, and global health research. The journey to this unlikely outcome is an engrossing tale of outside forces that shape racial and cultural identity, the importance of mentorship and friendship, and the lasting impact of an unstable and often heartbreaking family dynamic.

The third edition of Food Politics has been updated to reflect the latest developments and research on today's global food landscape, including the realities of food markets, farm production methods, food manufacturing, and dietary health challenges. New material covers the rise of China in world food markets and global food politics, the unabated and increasing risks to farming from climate change, the impact COVID-19 had on incomes and hunger, the equally shocking impact from the war in Ukraine on food prices and trade, and surprising scientific and technical breakthroughs such as the genome editing of crops (CRISPR) and the marketing of cell-cultured (animal-free) meats. Each chapter has been updated with new data on population growth, hunger and food security, trade conflicts, humanitarian aid, carbon farming, regenerative agriculture, holistic grazing, animal welfare, genetically engineered food, and more. Discussing the politics and policies that continue to shape our contemporary food system, Robert Paarlberg challenges myths and critiques more than a few of today's fashionable beliefs about farming and food. A must-listen for those ready to have their thinking about food politics informed, but also challenged. "

In this Very Short Introduction, Marta Wayne and Benjamin Bolker address these questions through the lenses of ecology and evolution. Assessing the management of outbreaks of diseases such as influenza, HIV/AIDS, cholera, and COVID-19, they provide specific examples to illustrate why major diseases still threaten populations all over the world.

Worldwide, approximately one percent of the global population is diagnosed with epilepsy at some point in their lives. With the diagnosis come questions, concerns, and uncertainties from both the person diagnosed and their family. So, where to go? Navigating Life with Epilepsy provides accessible, comprehensive, and up-to-date information about epilepsy shared from the two decades of experience of epileptologist David Spencer, MD, FAAN. This book guides the listener through the initial diagnosis, offers explanations on current approaches to diagnostic testing, medications, treatment options, and life management for the patient, their family, and their caregiver. Patient's stories are peppered throughout to illustrate that you are not alone: like you, they must navigate the myriad psychosocial challenges associated with epilepsy, including everyday concerns like driving, work, and relationships. Navigating Life with Epilepsy is a perfect resource for both patients with epilepsy and the family members and friends who care for them. "

                "During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, one renowned scientist, in his famous bowtie, appeared daily on major news networks such as MSNBC, NPR, the BBC, and others. Dr. Peter J. Hotez often went without sleep, working around the clock to develop a nonprofit COVID-19 vaccine and to keep the public informed. During that time, he was one of the most trusted voices on the pandemic and was even nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his selfless work. He also became one of the main targets of anti-science rhetoric that gained traction through conservative news media. In this eyewitness story of how the anti-vaccine movement grew into a dangerous and prominent anti-science element in American politics, Hotez describes the devastating impacts it has had on Americans' health and lives. As a scientist who has endured antagonism from anti-vaxxers and been at the forefront of both essential scientific discovery and advocacy, Hotez is uniquely qualified to tell this story. By weaving his personal experiences together with information on how the anti-vaccine movement became a tool of far-right political figures around the world, Hotez opens readers' eyes to the dangers of anti-science. He explains how anti-science became a major societal and lethal force: in the first years of the pandemic, more than 200,000 unvaccinated Americans needlessly died despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Even as he paints a picture of the world under a shadow of aggressive ignorance, Hotez demonstrates his innate optimism, offering solutions for how to combat science denial and save lives in the process.

                "Take a fascinating deep dive into the dark world of forensic science as experts team up to solve the identity of an unknown woman by exploring the rapidly evolving techniques being used to break the most notorious cold cases.   Fans of true crime shows like  CSI, NCIS, Criminal Minds,  and  Law and Order  know that when it comes to \"getting the bad guy\" behind bars, your best chance of success boils down to the strength of your evidence\u2014and the forensic science used to obtain it. Beyond the silver screen, forensic science has been used for decades to help solve even the most tough-to-crack cases. In 2018, the accused Golden State Killer, Joseph DeAngelo, was finally apprehended after a decades-long investigation thanks to a very recent technique called forensic genealogy, which has since led to the closure of hundreds of cold cases, bringing long-awaited justice to victims and families alike. But when it comes to solving these incredibly difficult cases, forensic genealogy is just the tip of the iceberg\u2014and many readers have no idea just how far down that iceberg goes.    For Laurah Norton, forensic science was always more of a passion than anything else. But after learning about a mishandled 1990s cold case involving missing twins, she was spurred to action, eventually creating a massively popular podcast and building a platform that helped bring widespread attention and resources to the case.  LAY THEM TO REST  builds on Laurah's fascination with these investigations, introducing readers to the history and evolution of forensic science, from the death masks used in Ancient Rome to the 3-D facial reconstruction technology used today. Incorporating the stories of real-life John & Jane Does from around the world, Laurah also examines how changing identification methods have helped solve the most iconic cold cases. Along the way readers will also get to see Laurah solve a case in real time with forensic anthropologist Dr. Amy Michael, as they try to determine the identity of \"Ina\" Jane Doe, a woman whose head was found in a brush in an Illinois park in 1993.    More than just a chronicle of the history of forensics,  LAY THEM TO REST  is also a celebration of the growing field of experts, forensic artists, and anthropologists (many of whom Laurah talks to in the book), who work tirelessly to bring closure to these unsolved cases. And of course, this book asks  why  some cases go unsolved, highlighting the \"missing missing,\" the sex workers, undocumented, the cases that so desperately need our attention, but so rarely get it.    Engrossing, informative, heartbreaking, and hopeful,  LAY THEM TO REST  is a deep dive into the world of forensic science, showing readers how far we've come in cracking cases and catching killers, and illuminating just how far we have yet to go.

                "For forty years in the mid-nineteenth century, \"Madame Restell,\" the nom de guerre of the most successful female physician in America, sold birth-control medication, attended women during their pregnancies, delivered their children, and performed abortions in a series of clinics run out of her home in New York City. It was the abortions that made her famous. \"Restellism\" became the term her detractors used to indict her. Restell began practicing when abortion was largely unregulated in most of the United States, including New York. But as a sense of disquiet arose about single women flocking to the city for work, greater sexual freedoms, changing views of the roles of motherhood and childhood, and fewer children being born to white, married, middle-class women, Restell came to stand for everything that threatened the status quo. From 1829 onward, restrictions on abortion began to put Restell in legal jeopardy. For much of this period, she prevailed\u2014until she didn't. A story that is all too relevant to the current attempts to criminalize abortion in our own age, The Trials of Madame Restell paints an unforgettable picture of the changing society of nineteenth-century New York and brings Restell to the attention of a whole new generation of women whose fundamental rights are under siege.

Today we have the knowledge, understanding, and technology to predictably relieve pain and neurological deficits like never before-yet many patients are still getting subpar care. Foundational knowledge of surgical spine care isn't spreading to the medical community, let alone to patients, whose quality of life hangs in the balance. With The Back Story on Spine Care, orthopedic specialist Dr. Drew Bednar presents case studies that illuminate the common issues plaguing patients-and their treatment-today. Back problems are among the most common health issues, and with Dr. Bednar's insights, knowledge, and practical tips, medical professionals can provide care that leads to healthier backs and happier lives.

Tara Sidhoo Fraser is thirty-one years old when a rare mutation in her brain causes a stroke. Awakening after surgery with no memory of her previous life, she attempts to piece it all back together through a haze of amnesia. Yet, as memories do begin to surface, they are seen through someone else's eyes-the person whose body she stole, whom she calls Ghost. Fighting to stabilize her existence, Tara struggles with the gulf between who she was and who she is now, while constantly battling and paying penance to Ghost. She meets Jude, who is also contending with their identity, the gap between who they are and who they present to the world. As Jude's transition progresses and they begin testosterone injections, Tara's conflict with Ghost heightens. Ghost's voice becomes stronger, and memories of hospital visits, old desires, and her ex threaten Tara's new relationship. She burrows deeper into the mystery of who she once was, recognizing the need to fuse herself and Ghost into one. When My Ghost Sings is a lyrical memoir of healing, a farewell letter, and an embracing/reclamation of selfhood. "

Recognizing the increasing stressors in the role including the impact of the environment in which doctors work, the book examines some of the key emotional drivers for this unhappiness among doctors at work-shame, stigma, suffering, and sacrifice-and offers practical steps to emotional and physical recovery. Despite the obvious challenges and stresses of the role, with the right support in place the vast majority of doctors can thrive in their jobs. Policy makers, politicians, educators, and hospital managers will be reminded of the ethical duty to ensure that doctors are cared for and have access to the time, people, and spaces to remain psychological healthy, while doctors will learn to recognize and seek actively the help that they need, and to support and guide one another.

                "Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most commonly diagnosed birth abnormality in the US. With great advances in surgery and medicine, however, survival rates have improved by 75% since the 1940s. With better medical care, babies born today with CHD have a good chance of surviving, but throughout their entire lives they can face surgeries, invasive treatments, lifelong monitoring, frequent medical check-ups, and significant limitations on physical activity, in addition to poor public awareness. Much attention has rightly been focused on providing their parents and caretakers with resources and information. Little attention, however, has been paid to the psychosocial impacts on these individuals, especially as they grow, mature, and become adults living with a serious, chronic medical condition. Prevalence rates for anxiety, depression, and PTSD are significantly higher (2-3x in some cases) for people living with CHD than the general adult population. Liza Morton and Tracy Livecchi are both mental health professionals who have developed a specialty in working with clients who have chronic medical conditions, and they are both themselves living with CHD. While their powerful personal stories are woven into the narrative, the book is focused on providing evidence-based coping and self-care skills for adults living with CHD. "

                "How a miracle treatment turned deadly and changed the course of the AIDS crisis.    By the mid 1980s, AIDS hysteria was so rampant that a fearful and prejudiced public ignored stories of gay men falling ill with lesions and mouth ulcers. President Reagan avoided mentioning the disease entirely. Then, as chronicled in  Blood Farm , a new HIV-positive population emerged, one that included kids like Ken Dixon, Brad Cross, and Ryan White who had been infected as young as ten years old. But how?  Unbeknownst to doctors and patients, pharmaceutical companies like Bayer, Baxter, and Armour collected plasma on skid row, in night clubs, and in some of America\u2019s most notorious prisons to make Factor VIII, a new miracle treatment for hemophilia. Companies knew these practices put patients at high risk of HIV, but miracles are a lucrative business, so they knowingly sold an infected product and effectively played Russian Roulette with hemophiliacs\u2019 lives. The results were catastrophic. In America, some 8,000 people with hemophilia contracted HIV; only 700 are alive today.  Award-winning journalist Cara McGoogan daringly exposes an expansive map of corporate greed and negligence that led to one of the biggest overlooked medical scandals in history. Alongside her we meet survivors turned activists, determined small town lawyers, and fearless reporters desperate for justice. Their fight for retribution created a critical inflection point in the AIDS crisis: stigmas shifted, settlements were awarded, and, later, President George H.W. Bush signed into law the largest federal program on HIV. In shocking, riveting detail,  Blood Farm  uncovers how a miracle treatment became a deadly poison and forever changed our understanding of AIDS. "

Craig Smith, M.D., Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, went from performing heart surgeries on patients both everyday and celebrated (he performed the quadruple bypass that saved Bill Clinton's life in 2004) to sitting in his tomb-quiet office looking out at George Washington Bridge. And he started to write. His Covid emails were balm to the staffers and later became celebrated for Dr. Smith's care and thought in his assessment of the work of the hospital\u2013of any hospital. Nobility in Small Things not only takes us into the mind and soul of a surgeon with the ability to \"play God\" but into the heart of a man who chose a lifesaving career. The book introduces us to patients and peers, and moves from family-building and heartbreak at home, to the tragic suicide of two fellow M.D.s. Dr. Smith also writes vulnerably about his debilitating social anxiety and how he overcame it. Dr. Smith shows us not just the making of a surgeon in Nobility in Small Things, but the maintenance of one: the deep feeling and moral philosophy that anchor the daily miracles that define his profession.

                "A Brief History of Intelligence bridges the gap between AI and neuroscience by telling the evolutionary story of how the brain came to be. The entirety of the human brain's 4-billion-year story can be summarised as the culmination of five evolutionary breakthroughs, starting from the very first brains, all the way to the modern human brains. Each breakthrough emerged from new sets of brain modifications, and equipped animals with a new suite of intellectual faculties. These five breakthroughs are the organising map to this book, and they make up our itinerary for our adventure back in time. Each breakthrough also has fascinating corollaries to breakthroughs in AI. Indeed, there will be plenty of such surprises along the way. For instance: the innovation that enabled AI to beat humans in the game of Go \u2013 temporal difference reinforcement learning \u2013 was an innovation discovered by our fish ancestors over 500 million years ago. The solutions to many of the current mysteries in AI \u2013 such as 'common sense' \u2013 can be found in the tiny brain of a mouse. Where do emotions come from? Research suggests that they may have arisen simply as a solution to navigation in ancient worm brains. Unravelling this evolutionary story will reveal the hidden features of human intelligence and with them, just how your mind came to be. "

                "A remarkable, uplifting story about one of the greatest medical breakthroughs of the 20th century.  In 1951 in Sydney, Australia, a fourteen-year-old boy named James Harrison was near death when he received a transfusion of blood that saved his life. A few years later, and half a world away, a shy young doctor at Columbia University realized he was more comfortable in the lab than in the examination room. Neither could have imagined how their paths would cross, or how they would change the world.  In Good Blood, bestselling writer Julian Guthrie tells the gripping tale of the race to cure a horrible a\ufb04iction known as Rh disease that stalked families and caused a mother's immune system to attack her own unborn child. The story is anchored by two very di\ufb00erent men on two continents: Dr. John Gorman in New York, who would land on a brilliant yet contrarian idea, and the unassuming Australian whose almost magical blood\u2014and his unyielding devotion to donating it\u2014would save millions of lives.  Good Blood takes us from Australia to America, from research laboratories to hospitals, and even into Sing Sing prison, where experimental blood trials were held. It is a tale of discovery and invention, the progress and pitfalls of medicine, and the everyday heroics that fundamentally changed the health of women and babies. "

In addition to this high-powered, high-pressured role, Liz faced her own breast cancer diagnosis, severe depression and suicidal thoughts, in tandem with commonplace sexual harassment and bullying. And by revealing how she coped when her life crashed around her, she demonstrates there is always hope. "

                "\"I am opposed to heart disease and cancer the way one is opposed to sin.\" With that as her battle cry, health activist and philanthropist Mary Woodard Lasker had a singular goal: saving lives by increasing medical research. Together with her husband, advertising genius Albert, they created the Lasker Foundation, bestowing the Lasker Awards. Known as the \"American Nobels,\" these became the most prestigious research awards in America. The Laskers' next step was transforming the sleepy and ineffectual American Society for the Control of Cancer, reinventing it as the American Cancer Society in 1944. But the real increase in medical research funding occurred when Mary discovered a revolutionary source: the federal government. \"I'm just a catalytic agent,\" she would insist, while she tirelessly lobbied Congress and presidents alike. She played a major role in expanding the National Institutes of Health from a single entity to the largest research facility in the world. A feminist who used her femininity wisely, Mary's ultimate victory was bringing together two political adversaries to help launch the original cancer moonshot: the 1971 National Cancer Act. This deeply researched biography paints the portrait of a woman who was savvy, steely, and deliberate. Mary Lasker courageously positioned herself at the crossroads of politics, science, and medicine. At a time when women in research laboratories and the halls of Congress were anomalies, she smashed stereotypes. "

Abandoned at the hospital by his parents, he became a ward of New Jersey under the care of a state-employed surgeon who experimentally rebuilt his face. Running from the Mirror is a poignant story of one man's struggle to survive against staggering odds and create a meaningful life for himself. With unapologetic candor, Howard gives an unflinching account of growing up a bullied outcast, with no family to officially call his own. Relying on little more than street smarts and grit, he rises from dishwasher to successful entrepreneur. Along the way, a European actress, a schoolteacher, and a fiery Latina help transform his life. Filled with heart-wrenching suffering as well as soul-lifting joy, Running from the Mirror is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. "

Operation Warp Speed got the COVID-19 vaccine to the American people in less than ten months. Operation Warp Speed did not happen by accident. It was the result of exceptional leadership, explicit strategy, and unprecedented teamwork.  Author Paul Mango, one of the key leaders of Operation Warp Speed and the former deputy chief of US Health and Human Services, chronicles the challenges of developing the vaccine. In this harrowing, behind-the-scenes account of the most successful public-private partnership since World War II, we learn how the nation's biggest leaders accomplished the impossible. Through sheer will and commitment, a small group of leaders fulfilled its mission, making the United States the only country in the world which could offer a vaccine to any citizen by April 2021, scarcely fourteen months after the genetic identification of the virus.

                "Killer Looks is the definitive story about the long-forgotten practice of providing free nose jobs, face-lifts, breast implants, and other physical alterations to prisoners, the idea being that by remodeling the face you remake the man. From the 1920s up to the mid-1990s, half a million prison inmates across America, Canada, and the UK willingly went under the knife, their tab picked up by the government.  In the beginning, this was a haphazard affair\u2014applied inconsistently and unfairly to inmates, but entering the 1960s, a movement to scientifically quantify the long-term effect of such programs took hold. And, strange as it may sound, the criminologists were right: recidivism rates plummeted.  In 1967, a three-year cosmetic surgery program set on Rikers Island saw recidivism rates drop 36% for surgically altered offenders. The program, funded by a $240,000 grant from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, was led by Dr. Michael Lewin, who ran a similar program at Sing-Sing prison in 1953.  Killer Looks draws on the intersectionality of socioeconomic success, racial bias, the prison industry complex and the fallacy of attractiveness to get to the heart of how appearance and societal approval creates self-worth, and uncovers deeper truths of beauty bias, inherited racism, effective recidivism programs, and inequality.

                "WITH A FOREWORD BY SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE A renowned cardiologist and Harvard professor spells out the future digital shift of medicine \u2014 and how it will impact the lives not only of patients and health care professionals but of all humans. Future care is virtual care: sensor-aided, digitally enabled, and powered by predictive analytics. Like most facets of modern life, human organs, too, are being digitally monitored. Sensors are well on their way to helping us proactively capture the information needed to predict and prevent disease. Paired with the medical world's growing emphasis on wellness and prevention, the digital revolution will help us effectively monitor and address the chronic diseases that have been the Achilles' heel of the health care system to date. This large-scale transition is not only going to reshape the patient-physician relationship but also dramatically change how hospitals and the business of medicine operate. Dr. Singh explores the upswell of virtual care, the evolving role of sensors, and the impact of artificial intelligence in medicine and health care through cutting-edge science, big idea projections, and patient stories. Using anecdotes from his own COVID-19 illness and medical practice, Dr. Singh shows that the success of the digital revolution in medicine is dependent on our ability to understand and adapt to this changing landscape. Future Care provides fascinating insights into how health care can become sensible, affordable, and practical and why everyone needs to become a part of the solution. It is an important and timely contribution to the ongoing and increasingly urgent conversation about medicine, technology, and health care. "

                "A sweeping biography of the visionary behind bone marrow transplantation and the story of the diseases cured by Don Thomas's discovery. In the last half of the twentieth century, Thomas himself discovered a cure for every marrow-based disease\u2014like leukemia, lymphoma, and sickle-cell anemia\u2014forever changing treatment for some of the deadliest illnesses. His feats were extraordinary, earning him a Nobel Prize, and the cascade of treatments he inspired have reshaped and will continue to reshape the practice of clinical medicine. Yet no one has ever written Thomas's courageous story. Dr. Frederick R. Appelbaum, a member of Thomas's research team, does so for the first time in Living Medicine: Don Thomas, Marrow Transplantation, and the Cell Therapy Revolution. Bone marrow transplantation has now saved over a million lives, but when Thomas first had the idea, he was met with disbelief by the scientific community. Appelbaum, informed by decades in the field and personal connection with Thomas, tells us the secrets to Thomas's success: his unique characteristics, how he created an effective team of researchers, and how he overcame the technical obstacles of marrow transplantation. Appelbaum tells a bigger story, too, of the scientific and societal implications of this achievement, which are critical for scientific and lay readers alike so that we all might be better informed of how far our medical progress has come and will go.

                "Health care as it stands today needs to be re-imagined. Redefining the Boundaries of Medicine by Paul Cerrato and Dr. John Halamka challenges the profession to renegotiate its priorities and address the fact that it's become timid and reluctant to explore new care delivery models. The guiding premise of this book is that rethinking and reimagining the way medicine is practiced in the 21st century will improve health outcomes, and that technology is central to this transformation. Dr. Halamka is the President and Paul Cerrato is the Senior Research Analyst and Communications Specialist for Mayo Clinic Platform, which is harnessing novel technologies to change how care is provided. This cutting-edge work, along with their combined 80 years of experience in healthcare, afford Dr. Halamka and Mr. Cerrato authoritative voices in technology and health care. This book shows how one-size-fits-all health care is slowly giving way to a more precise, personalized approach that takes into account each person's unique environmental and genetic risk factors. It discusses the use of several emerging technological tools that give each patient a unique \"topographical map\" to navigate their journey. Artificial intelligence in health care must be accurate, equitable and ethical; providers need to embrace a better way to predict diseases, identify effective treatments and rethink much of the conventional wisdom that has been handed down over the decades. Redefining the Boundaries of Medicine provides the guide to doing just that. "

                "The life of a veterinarian is challenging: keeping up with advances in medical care, making difficult decisions about people's beloved companions, and, in Dr. Doug Mader's case, navigating the social unrest in Los Angeles in the early 1990s. As one of the few exotic animal experts in California, he was just as likely to be treating a lion as a house cat. The Vet at Noah's Ark follows Dr. Mader and his staff over the course of a year at Noah's Ark Veterinary Hospital, an inner-city LA area veterinary hospital where Dr. Mader treats not only dogs and cats, but also emus, skunks, snakes, foxes, monkeys, and a host of other exotic animals. This real life drama is set against the backdrop of the trial of four police officers in the Rodney King case, as well as the violent aftermath following their acquittal. This is a book about survival, both of the pets that Dr. Mader and his staff try to save on a daily basis, as well as the staff themselves. Living in the harsh reality of the city, surrounded by gangs, drugs, violence, traffic, smog, and deadly riots, they must overcome and rise above, for their own survival and that of the animals who need them. This awe-inspiring account is told through Dr. Mader's riveting storytelling-as Carl Hiaasen writes, \"Doug is fearless and dedicated,\" and \"a damn good storyteller.\" "

                "A revelatory account of how power, politics, and greed have placed the unfulfilled promise of personalized medicine at the center of American medicine  The United States is embarking on a medical revolution. Supporters of personalized, or precision, medicine\u2014the tailoring of health care to our genomes\u2014have promised to usher in a new era of miracle cures. Advocates of this gene-guided health-care practice foresee a future where skyrocketing costs can be curbed by customization and unjust disparities are vanquished by biomedical breakthroughs. Progress, however, has come slowly, and with a price too high for the average citizen. In  Tyranny of the Gene,  James Tabery exposes the origin story of personalized medicine\u2014essentially a marketing idea dreamed up by pharmaceutical executives\u2014and traces its path from the Human Genome Project to the present, revealing how politicians, influential federal scientists, biotech companies, and drug giants all rallied behind the genetic hype. The result is a medical revolution that privileges the few at the expense of health care that benefits us all. Now American health care, driven by the commercialization of biomedical research, is shifting focus away from the study of the social and environmental determinants of health, such as access to fresh and nutritious food, exposure to toxic chemicals, and stress caused by financial insecurity. Instead, it is increasingly investing in \u201cmiracle pills\u201d for leukemia that would bankrupt most users, genetic studies of minoritized populations that ignore structural racism and walk dangerously close to eugenic conclusions, and oncology centers that advertise the perfect gene-drug match, igniting a patient\u2019s hope, and often dashing it later. Tyranny of the Gene  sounds a warning cry about the current trajectory of health care and charts a path to a more equitable alternative. "

The most common MUS are back pain, abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. This audiobook addresses the obstacles of managing people with MUS in our modern day society from both a historical and contemporary perspective.  Most MUS are psychosomatic in origin, caused by a complex interaction between nature and nurture, between biological and psychosocial factors. Psychosomatic symptoms are as real and as severe as the symptoms associated with structural damage to the brain. Unique and concise, the audiobook explores the biological and psychosocial mechanisms, the clinical features, and current and future treatments of common MUS.  Exploring the unsolved in an accessible manner, Medically Unexplained Symptoms invokes the methodologies of medical science, history, and sociology to investigate how brain flaws can lead to debilitating symptoms.

The authors provide dozens of examples of kindred episodes of mass hysteria throughout history, in addition to psychosomatic conditions and even the role of insects in triggering outbreaks.  It is one of the most extraordinary cases in the history of science: the mating calls of insects were mistaken for a \"sonic weapon\" that led to a major diplomatic row. Since August 2017, the world media has been absorbed in the \"attack\" on diplomats from the American and Canadian Embassies in Cuba. While physicians treating victims have described it as a novel and perplexing condition that involves an array of complaints including brain damage, the authors present compelling evidence that mass psychogenic illness was the cause of \"Havana Syndrome.\"  This mysterious condition that has baffled experts is explored across eleven chapters which offer insights by a prominent neurologist and an expert on psychogenic illness. A lively and enthralling listen, the authors explore the history of similar scares from the eighteenth century belief that sounds from certain musical instruments were harmful to human health, to nineteenth century cases of \"telephone shock,\" and more contemporary panics involving people living near wind turbines that have been tied to a variety of health complaints. The authors provide dozens of examples of kindred episodes of mass hysteria throughout history, in addition to psychosomatic conditions and even the role of insects in triggering outbreaks.  Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story Behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria is a scientific detective story and a case study in the social construction of mass psychogenic illness.
