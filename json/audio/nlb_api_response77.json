                "Toby Jones and Holliday Grainger star in a new BBC Radio 4 full-cast dramatisation of Dodie Smith's enduringly popular coming-of-age novel In the 1930s, seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain lives in a crumbling ruin of a castle in the Suffolk countryside. Her father, an author wrestling with writer's block, spends his time reading detective stories; her bohemian stepmother Topaz is an artist's model, and her beautiful older sister Rose is determined to escape the poverty of their existence \u2013 ideally by marriage to a rich man. Intelligent and observant, Cassandra chronicles the eccentricities of her relations in her journal, in a bid to capture her family and their lives at the castle. When two rich American brothers, Simon and Neil Cotton, arrive unexpectedly, the family's isolation is disrupted. Rose accepts a marriage proposal from Simon, and as she is whisked off to a world of wealth in London, Cassandra is left to deal with the increasingly bizarre behaviour of her father \u2013 as well as her own feelings for Simon... Dodie Smith's charming, funny and poignant love story is a classic of 20th-Century English literature and this sparkling adaptation, starring Toby Jones and Holliday Grainger, will enchant and delight. Duration: 2 hours. "

Gwen Russell is thrilled to hear she will be heading to Paris with her family.

If that wasn't enough excitement, Gwen finds out that her all-time favorite band is playing a one-night only concert in Paris-and there are tickets available to the sold-old show for three lucky people. The catch? Fans who want a golden ticket have to work for it via a scavenger hunt around the City of Light. Through cryptic clues blasted out every day through a special website, Gwen and her new friends find themselves in a race against time-and against other die-hard fans-as they scramble to landmarks throughout Paris. And it turns out the concert tickets might not even be the biggest prize . . . "

To celebrate her centenary Vintage Classics presents special editions of her greatest and most timeless novels  'I feel there are demons around.'  Everyone is thinking about Julius King. For comfortable, long-married Hilda and Rupert, he is a mystery. For Morgan, Hilda's tormented sister, he is an obsession. For Morgan's abandoned husband, Tallis, he is the source of ruin. For Simon and Axel, deeply in love, he stirs up jealousy and unease. What is Julius thinking about? He's thinking about Hilda, Rupert, Morgan, Tallis, Simon and Axel, and they will not all survive his malevolent attention. (C) Iris Murdoch 1975 (P) Penguin Audio 2020. "

                "Booksmart  meets  Never Have I Ever  in this debut YA rom-com about two Korean American teens forced into a shared college visit road trip where they discover that the reasons they\u2019ve been rivals their entire lives might actually be signs they\u2019re a perfect pair.  Winter Park and Bobby Bae are Korean American high school juniors whose families have been friends since the kids were making crayon art. They, however, are repulsed by each other. Winter is MIT-bound, comfortable keeping people at arm\u2019s length, and known by others as responsible, though she has a desire to let loose. This probably comes from her rebel grandmother, who is constantly pushing boundaries and encouraging Winter to do so as well. Winter\u2019s best friend is moving abroad and won\u2019t be attending college at all, and Winter\u2019s wrestling with what it means to be left behind. Bobby is as Type-A, anxious, and risk-averse as you can get. He\u2019s also been recently dumped, which has him feeling disoriented and untethered. That\u2019s why, when Winter\u2019s and Bobby\u2019s parents insist that they go on a northeast college campus tour together, both teens find reasons to accept even though the idea of being stuck in a car together for 700 miles sounds unbearable. What awaits them is a journey of self-discovery, and the only rule on their road trip is to break all the rules. At first, this happens in hilariously calculated ways (using lists and reason and logic!), but they soon abandon that, challenging each other to dares in Virginia, getting high and wandering around Philly for food\u2014and battling the subsequent digestive distress\u2014and crashing a party in Cambridge. And, of course, realizing that they\u2019re perfect together. "

                "\"What an immature, self-destructive, antiquated mischief is man! How obscure and gross his prancing and chattering on his little stage of evolution! How loathsome and beyond words boring all the thoughts and self-approval of his biological by-product! this half-formed, ill-conditioned body! this erratic, maladjusted mechanism of his soul: on one side the harmonious instincts and balanced responses of the animal, on the other the inflexible purpose of the engine, and between them man, equally alien from the being of Nature and the doing of the machine, the vile becoming!\"  Evelyn Waugh's first novel, Decline and Fall, is the daring and hilarious tale of Paul Pennyfeather, a theology student expelled from Oxford and sent to teach at a private boys' school in Wales. Previously a modest young man, Paul finds himself a bit out of place amongst the teachers of Llanabba, who are all misfits, fools, and derelicts themselves: Prendy (the anxious) and Captain Grimes (the drunk), just to name two. There are not only failed men and rowdy boys in this Welsh town to occupy his time, however; Margot Beste-Chetwynde, the mother of one of his students, quickly becomes the object of Paul's affections. But Margot may not be all she appears to, and Paul's world is turned upside down all over again.  With a title inspired both by Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West, Waugh's Decline and Fall is a brilliant farce and a biting satire of English morals and school life of the 1920s and, by extension, of the experience of generations of so many students and educators since.

                "Discover the full story of the sorceress Medea, one of the most reviled and maligned women of Greek antiquity, in this propulsive and evocative debut in the tradition of  Circe ,  Elektra , and  Stone Blind .  Among the women of Greek mythology, the witch Medea may be the most despised. Known for the brutal act of killing her own children to exact vengeance on her deceitful husband, the Argonauts leader Jason, Medea has carved out a singularly infamous niche in our histories.   But what if that isn't the full story?   The daughter of a sea nymph and the granddaughter of a Titan, Medea is a paradox. She is at once rendered compelling by virtue of the divinity that flows through her bloodline and made powerless by the fact of her being a woman. As a child, she intuitively submerges herself in witchcraft and sorcery, but soon finds it may not be a match for the prophecies that hang over her entire family like a shroud.   As Medea comes into her own as a woman and a witch, she also faces the arrival of the hero Jason, preordained by the gods to be not only her husband, but also her lifeline to escape her isolated existence. Medea travels the treacherous seas with the Argonauts, battles demons she had never conceived of, and falls in love with the man who may ultimately be her downfall.   In this propulsive, beautifully written debut, readers will finally hear Medea's side of the story through a fresh and feminist lens. "

Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, now in a beautiful Penguin Vitae edition with a foreword by Kiese Laymon A Penguin Classic Hardcover  Celebrating its fortieth anniversary,  The Color Purple  writes a message of healing, forgiveness, self-discovery, and sisterhood to a new generation of readers.\u00a0 An inspiration to authors who continue to give voice to the multidimensionality of Black women\u2019s stories, including Tayari Jones, Honor\u00e9e Fanonne Jeffers, Jesmyn Ward, and more,\u00a0  The Color Purple  remains an essential read in conversation with storytellers today. A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature,  The Color Purple  depicts the lives of African American women in early-twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance, and silence. Through a series of letters spanning nearly thirty years, first from Celie to God, then from the sisters to each other, the novel draws readers into a rich and memorable portrayal of Black women\u2014their pain and struggle, companionship and growth, resilience and bravery. Deeply compassionate and beautifully imagined,  The Color Purple  breaks the silence around domestic and sexual abuse, and carries readers on an epic and spirit-affirming journey toward transformation, redemption, and love.

Maurice Sendak's Caldecott Medal\u2013winning picture book has become one of the most highly acclaimed and best-loved children's books of all time.  This iconic story of Max and his journey to visit the Wild Things has inspired a movie, an opera, and the imagination of generations.  His mother called him \"WILD THING!\"   And Max said \"I'LL EAT YOU UP!\"  So he was sent to bed without eating anything.  That very night in Max's room a forest grew  and grew\u2014  Mary Pols of Time magazine wrote that \"what makes Sendak's book so compelling is its grounding effect: Max has a tantrum and in a flight of fancy visits his wild side, but he is pulled back by a belief in parental love to a supper 'still hot.'\" Generations have shared this beautiful book, and readers of all ages will want to return to it again and again.  New York Public Library's #4 book on the list of \"Top Check Outs of All Time\"  One of the National Education Association's \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\"  The top picture book in School Library Journal's survey of its readers   Maurice Sendak was also the creator of such classics as In the Night Kitchen, Outside Over There, Higglety Pigglety Pop!, and Nutshell Library.

Julia Worthing is a mechanic, working in the Fiction Department at the Ministry of Truth. It's 1984, and Britain (now called Airstrip One) has long been absorbed into the larger trans-Atlantic nation of Oceania. Oceania has been at war for as long as anyone can remember, and is ruled by an ultra-totalitarian Party, whose leader is a quasi-mythical figure called Big Brother. In short, everything about this world is as it is in Orwell's 1984.  All her life, Julia has known only Oceania, and, until she meets Winston Smith, she has never imagined anything else. She is an ideal citizen: cheerfully cynical, always ready with a bribe, piously repeating every political slogan while believing in nothing. She routinely breaks the rules, but also collaborates with the regime when necessary. Everyone likes Julia.  Then one day she finds herself walking toward Winston Smith in a corridor and impulsively slips him a note, setting in motion the devastating, unforgettable events of the classic story. Julia takes us on a surprising journey through Orwell's now-iconic dystopia, with twists that reveal unexpected sides not only to Julia, but to other familiar figures in the 1984 universe. This unique perspective lays bare our own world in haunting and provocative ways, just as the original did almost seventy-five years ago. "

                "The Pulitzer Prize winning modern classic of two Cuban musician brothers during the mambo-filled nights of 50's New York from literary trailblazer, Oscar Hijuelos.    It's 1949 and two young Cuban musicians make their way from Havana to the grand stage of New York City. It is the era of mambo, and the Castillo brothers, workers by day, become stars of the dance halls by night, where their orchestra plays the lush, sensuous, pulsing music that earns them the title of the Mambo Kings. This is their moment of youth, exuberance, love, and freedom\u2015a golden time that decades later is remembered with nostalgia and deep affection.  Hijuelos's portrait of the Castillo brothers, their families, their fellow musicians and lovers, their triumphs and tragedies, recreates the sights and sounds of an era in music and an unsung moment in American life.  Exuberantly celebrated from the moment it was published in 1989,  The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love  won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1990 (making Hijuelos the first Hispanic recipient of the award). It remains a perennial bestseller, and the story's themes of cultural fusion and identity are as relevant today as they were over 30 years ago, proving Hijuelos's novel to be a genuine and timeless classic.  Includes a Reading Group Guide. "

                "\"And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves.\"  To the Lighthouse chronicles the lives of the Ramsay family and their close friends, from the tranquil and motherly Mrs. Ramsay to the tragic and eccentric Mr. Ramsay, and their eight children and varied guests. Woolf uses the three movements of the novel to capture their complex family allegiances and the tensions between men and women at the time. Centered around their visits to the Isle of Skye between 1910 and 1920, the novel is an examination of the quiet, seemingly trivial moments of everyday life. As the world changes drastically around the Ramsays, they too must come to terms with, and hopefully face head on, their capacity to change along with it.  To the Lighthouse is number fifteen on Modern Library's list of one hundred best English-language novels of the twentieth century, and it was named as one of the best English-language novels since 1923 by Time magazine.

Everyone craves retirement from the Civil Service, don't they? That time for an ageing patriarch to enjoy the fruits of a well-earned pension and the respect of his family; maybe even to indulge in a love of music halls and metropolitan life. If only people would listen and do as they were told... His fourth son William, the long-suffering narrator, is the constant butt of his father's jokes and victim of his brothers' indifference. But as death, divorce and other darker dramas follow, father and son slowly establish a strange harmony. "

For Elisabeth - a young painter - the GDR is her generation's chance to build a glorious, egalitarian socialist future. For her brother Uli, it is a place of stricture and oppression. Separating them is the ever-wider chasm of the party line; over them loom the twin spectres of opportunity and fear, and the shadow of their defector brother Konrad. In prose as bold as a scarlet paint stroke, Brigitte Reimann battles with the clash of idealism and suppression, familial loyalty and desire. The result is this ground-breaking classic of post-war East German literature. \u00a92022 Brigitte Reimann (P)2022 Penguin Audio. "

                "'A haunting and darkly beautiful retelling of Dickens's Great Expectations.' Karen Brooks, author. The icily enigmatic anti-hero of Charles Dickens's Great Expectations tells her own story ... and changes the ending in this beguiling feminist take on a classic for readers of Pip Williams and Karen Brooks.    At just three years of age, Estella is taken from her mother, adopted by the wealthy but eccentric Miss Havisham and taught how to break men's hearts. Satis House is dark and oppressive and life with the vengeful Miss Havisham a confusion of contradictory lessons, but the kindness of the household cook and Estella's love of the nearby marshes bring her some joy. Forced to play with Pip, a local boy from a lowly background, Estella captivates his soul and breaks his heart, exactly as Miss Havisham has planned.   Years later, Estella returns from school in France as a young woman and is thrust into London society. There she meets Pip again, who has acquired an unknown benefactor and come into money. Miss Havisham recruits Pip to help find Estella a husband, much to her distress. She seems forever fated to be the plaything of others, locked into the destructive cycles her adoptive mother set in motion.   Estella is beautiful, headstrong, enigmatic - but who is she, really? Will she ever be able to break free from the constraints of society's expectations and her own childhood? Will Estella finally find a way to tell her own story?  This evocative and mesmerising retelling of Great Expectations sheds light on a little understood character in one of Dickens's most beloved novels. "

                "Ernest Hemingway's landmark short story of a veteran's solo fishing trip in Michigan's rugged Upper Peninsula, featuring a revelatory foreword by John N. Maclean.   \"A century since its publication in the collection In Our Time, \"Big Two-Hearted River\" has helped shape language and literature in America and across the globe, and its magnetic pull continues to draw readers, writers, and critics. The story is the best early example of Ernest Hemingway's now-familiar writing style: short sentences, punchy nouns and verbs, few adjectives and adverbs, and a seductive cadence. Easy to imitate, difficult to match. The subject matter of the story has inspired generations of writers to believe that fly fishing can be literature. More than any of his stories, it depends on his 'iceberg theory' of literature, the notion that leaving essential parts of a story unsaid, the underwater portion of the iceberg, adds to its power. Taken in context with his other work, it marks Hemingway's passage from boyish writer to accomplished author: nothing big came before it, novels and stories poured out after it.\" \u2014from the foreword by John N. Maclean. "

                "An NYRB Classics Original A humble clerk and his loving wife scrape out a quiet existence on the margins of Tokyo. Resigned, following years of exile and misfortune, to the bitter consequences of having married without their families' consent, and unable to have children of their own, Sosuke and Oyone find the delicate equilibrium of their household upset by a new obligation to meet the educational expenses of Sosuke's brash younger brother. While an unlikely new friendship appears to offer a way out of this bind, it also soon threatens to dredge up a past that could once again force them to flee the capital. Desperate and torn, Sosuke finally resolves to travel to a remote Zen Mountain monastery to see if perhaps there, through meditation, he can find a way out of his predicament. This moving and deceptively simple story, a melancholy tale shot through with glimmers of joy, beauty, and gentle wit, is an understated masterpiece by one of Japan's greatest writers. At the end of his life, Natsume Soseki declared The Gate, originally published in 1910, to be his favorite among all his novels. This new translation captures the oblique grace of the original while correcting numerous errors and omissions that marred the first English version. "

Its shadow falls ever darker on the world below, and on Dean Jocelin in particular.

First published in 1939, Steinbeck\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads\u2014driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity.\u00a0A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America.\u00a0At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. This Centennial edition, specially designed to commemorate one hundred years of Steinbeck, features french flaps and deckle-edged pages.

Imagine a United States in which registries and detainment camps for Muslim-Americans are a reality.  Fifteen-year-old Sarah-Mary Williams of Hannibal, Missouri, lives in this world, and though she has strong opinions on almost everything, she isn't concerned with the internments because she doesn't know any Muslims. She assumes that everything she reads and sees in the news is true, and that these plans are better for everyone's safety.  But when she happens upon Sadaf, a Muslim fugitive determined to reach freedom in Canada, Sarah-Mary at first believes she must turn her in. But Sadaf challenges Sarah-Mary's perceptions of right and wrong, and instead Sarah-Mary decides, with growing conviction, to do all she can to help Sadaf escape.  The two set off on a desperate journey, hitchhiking through the heart of an America that is at times courageous and kind, but always full of tension and danger for anyone deemed suspicious. "

                "With a new introduction from  New York Times  best-selling author Tayari Jones,  The Street  was Ann Petry's first novel, originally published in 1946 and hailed by critics as a masterwork.     The   Street  tells the poignant, often heartbreaking story of Lutie Johnson, a young black woman, and her spirited struggle to raise her son amid the violence, poverty, and racial dissonance of Harlem in the late 1940s.  Lutie is confronted by racism, sexism, and classism on a daily basis in her pursuit of the American dream for herself and her son, Bub. Lutie fully subscribes to the belief that if she follows the adages of Benjamin Franklin by working hard and saving wisely, she will be able to achieve the dream of being financially independent.  The first novel by an African-American woman to sell more than a million copies, its haunting tale still resonates today.  &#8220Petry is the writer we have been waiting for; hers are the stories we need to fully illuminate the questions of our moment, while also offering a page-turning good time. Ann Petry, the woman, had it all, and so does her insightful, prescient and unputdownable prose.&#8221\u2014Tayari Jones,  New York Times Book Review. "

                "\"Brave, lively, engaging . . . a fairy-tale novel, miraculouly returned to life.\" \u2014 The New York Times Book Review  Edith Wharton's spellbinding final novel, telling a story of love in the gilded age that crossed the boundaries of society, soon to be an Apple Original Series on Apple TV+   Set in the 1870s, the same period as Wharton's  The Age of Innocence ,  The Buccaneers  is about five wealthy American girls denied entry into New York Society because their parents' money is too new. At the suggestion of their clever governess, the girls sail to London, where they marry lords, earls, and dukes who find their beauty charming\u2014and their wealth extremely useful. After Wharton's death in 1937,  The Christian Science Monitor  said, \"If it could have been completed,  The Buccaneers  would doubtless stand among the richest and most sophisticated of Wharton's novels.\" Now, with wit and imagination, Marion Mainwaring has finished the story, taking her cue from Wharton's own synopsis. It is a novel any Wharton fan will celebrate and any romantic reader will love. This is the richly engaging story of Nan St. George and Guy Thwarte, an American heiress and an English aristocrat, whose love breaks the rules of both their societies. "

With Mr. Moore\u2019s vigorous and companionable translation, the book is now here for everyone to see.\u201d\u2014 The Wall Street Journal    \u00a0   The timeless masterpiece from Alessandro Manzoni, the father of modern Italian literature,  The Betrothed  receives its first new English-language translation in fifty years, hailed as \u201ca\u00a0landmark literary occasion\u201d by Jhumpa Lahiri.   \u00a0  The Betrothed  is a cornerstone of Italian culture, language, and literature. Published in its final form in 1842,  The Betrothed  has inspired generations of Italian readers and writers. Giuseppe Verdi composed his majestic Requiem Mass in honor of Manzoni. Italo Calvino called the novel \u201ca\u00a0classic that has never ceased shaping reality in Italy\u201d while Umberto Eco praised its author as a \u201cmost subtle critic and analyst of languages.\u201d  The Betrothed  has been celebrated by Primo Levi and Natalia Ginzburg, and is one of Pope Francis\u2019s favorite books. But, until now, it has remained relatively unknown to English readers. In the fall of 1628, two young lovers are forced to flee their village on the shores of Lake Como after a powerful lord prevents their marriage, plunging them into the maelstrom of history. Manzoni draws on actual people and events to create an unforgettable fresco of Italian life and society. In this greatest of historical novels, he takes the reader on a journey through the Spanish occupation of Milan, the ravages of war, class tensions, social injustice, religious faith, and a plague that devastates northern Italy. But within Manzoni\u2019s epic tale, readers will also\u00a0hear powerful echoes of our own day. Michael F. Moore\u2019s dynamic new translation\u00a0of  The Betrothed  brings to life Manzoni\u2019s timeless literary masterpiece. "

Bowles captures the duality of human frailty and cruelty in these seventeen taut and atmospheric tales, written between 1939 and 1949. Brutal and gorgeous, visceral yet profound, this timeless collection is \"one of the most profound, beautifully wrought, and haunting collections in our literature. . . at once austere, witty, violent, and sensuous. . . . His language has a purity of line, a poise and authority entirely its own, capable of instantly modulating from farce to horror without a ruffle\" (Tobias Wolff). "

                "Brought to you by Penguin.  Robert Poste's child is back at Cold Comfort Farm. But all is not well. Flora finds the farm transformed into a twee haven filled with Toby jugs and peasant pottery, and rooms labelled 'Quiete Retreate' and 'Greate laundrie'. It is, Flora winces, 'exactly like being locked in the Victoria and Albert Museum after closing time'. Worse, the farm is hosting a conference of the pretentious International Thinkers Group - a group made up of the 'sadistic owl' Mr Peccavi, loathsome Mr Mybug and the overpowering Mrs Ernestine Thump. And worst of all, there are no Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm. All the he-cousins have gone abroad to make their fortunes and the female cousins are having a pretty thin time of it. Once again the sensible Flora decides to take the situation in hand. \u00a9 Stella Gibbons 2011 (P) Penguin Audio 2022. "

' Unputdownable storytelling. I loved it.' - Hilary McKay, Costa Award-winning author of  The Skylark's War    In 1946, Rosa Sweetman, a young Kindertransport girl, is longing for her family to claim her. The war in Europe is over and she is the only child left at Westwood, a rambling country estate in the north of England, where she'd taken refuge seven years earlier.  The arrival of a friend of the family, Yara Fielding, starts an adventure that will take Rosa deep into the lush beauty of the Amazon rainforest in search of jaguars, ancient giant sloths and somewhere to belong. What she finds is Yara's lively, welcoming family on the banks of the river and, together, they face a danger greater than she could ever have imagined.  Featuring places and characters known and loved by fans of  Journey to the River Sea  (including, among others, Maia, Finn, Miss Minton and Clovis) this spectacular new chapter in the story tells of the next generation and the growing threats to the Amazon rainforest that continue to this day.

A sensational bestseller when it appeared in 1986,  The Garden of Eden  is the last uncompleted novel of Ernest Hemingway, which he worked on intermittently from 1946 until his death in 1961. Set on the C\u00f4te d'Azur in the 1920s, it is the story of a young American writer, David Bourne, his glamorous wife, Catherine, and the dangerous, erotic game they play when they fall in love with the same woman. \"A lean, sensuous narrative...taut, chic, and strangely contemporary,\"  The Garden of Eden  represents vintage Hemingway, the master \"doing what nobody did better\" (R. Z. Sheppard,  Time). "

When sixteen-year-old Portia is orphaned, she is plunged into the sophisticated and politely treacherous world of her wealthy half-brother's home. There she encounters the attractive cad Eddie. To him, Portia is at once child and woman, and he fears her gushing love. To her, Eddie is the only reason to be alive. But when Eddie follows Portia to a sea-side resort, the flash of a cigarette lighter in a darkened cinema illuminates a stunning romantic betrayal - and sets in motion one of the most moving and desperate flights of the heart in modern literature.

                "The definitive short story collection that established Ernest Hemingway's literary reputation, originally published in 1938.  Ernest Hemingway is a cultural icon\u2014an archetype of rugged masculinity, a romantic ideal of the intellectual in perpetual exile\u2014but, to his countless readers, Hemingway remains a literary force much greater than his image. Of all of Hemingway's canonical fictions, perhaps none demonstrate so forcefully the power of the author's revolutionary style as his short stories. In classics like \"Hills like White Elephants,\" \"The Butterfly in the Tank,\" and \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,\" Hemingway shows us great literature compressed to its most potent essentials. We also see, in Hemingway's short fiction, the tales that created the legend: these are stories of men and women in love and in war and on the hunt, stories of a lost generation born into a fractured time.    The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway  presents many of Hemingway's most famous classics alongside rare and unpublished material: Hemingway's early drafts and correspondence, his dazzling out-of-print essay on the art of the short story, and two marvelous examples of his earliest work\u2014his first published story, \"The Judgment of Manitou,\" which Hemingway wrote when still a high school student, and a never-before-published story, written when the author was recovering from a war injury in Milan after WWI. This work offers vital insight into the artistic development of one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. It is a perfect introduction for a new generation of Hemingway readers, and it belongs in the collection of any true Hemingway fan. "

A bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the world-weary beauty and majesty of Venice,  Across the River and into the Trees  stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War.

His adventures lead him into the world of the wealthy and dissipated yachtsmen who throng the region and involve him in a strange and unlikely love affair.   In this harshly realistic, yet oddly tender and wise novel, Hemingway perceptively delineates the personal struggles of both the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\" and creates one of the most subtle and moving portraits of a love affair in his oeuvre. By turns funny and tragic, lively and poetic, remarkable in its emotional impact,  To Have and Have Not  is literary high adventure at its finest. "

Edited by his son Patrick, who accompanied his father on the safari,  True at First Light  offers rare insights into the legendary American writer.  A blend of autobiography and fiction, the book opens on the day his close friend Pop, a celebrated hunter, leaves Ernest in charge of the safari camp and news arrives of a potential attack from a hostile tribe. Drama continues to build as his wife, Mary, pursues the great black-maned lion that has become her obsession, and Ernest becomes involved with a young African girl whom he supposedly plans to take as a second bride. Increasingly enchanted by the local African community, he struggles between the attraction of these two women and the wildly different cultures they represent.   Spicing his depictions of human longings with sharp humor, Hemingway captures the excitement of big-game hunting and the unparalleled beauty of the landscape. Rich in laughter, beauty, and profound insight.  True at First Light  is an extraordinary publishing event\u2014a breathtaking final work from one of our most beloved and important writers. "

It tells a fundamental human truth: in a volatile world, from our first breath to our last wish, through triumphs and pitfalls both trivial and profound, what sustains us, ultimately, is hope.\" \u2014 The Guardian    The last of his novels Ernest Hemingway saw published,  The Old Man and the Sea  has proved itself to be one of the most enduring works of American fiction. The story of a down-on-his-luck Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal\u2014a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream\u2014has been cherished by generations of readers.   Hemingway takes the timeless themes of courage in the face of adversity and personal triumph won from loss and transforms them into a magnificent twentieth-century classic. First published in 1952, this hugely popular tale confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. "

                "The definitive short story collection that established Ernest Hemingway's literary reputation, originally published in 1938.  Ernest Hemingway is a cultural icon\u2014an archetype of rugged masculinity, a romantic ideal of the intellectual in perpetual exile\u2014but, to his countless readers, Hemingway remains a literary force much greater than his image. Of all of Hemingway's canonical fictions, perhaps none demonstrate so forcefully the power of the author's revolutionary style as his short stories. In classics like \"Hills like White Elephants,\" \"The Butterfly in the Tank,\" and \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,\" Hemingway shows us great literature compressed to its most potent essentials. We also see, in Hemingway's short fiction, the tales that created the legend: these are stories of men and women in love and in war and on the hunt, stories of a lost generation born into a fractured time.    The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway  presents many of Hemingway's most famous classics alongside rare and unpublished material: Hemingway's early drafts and correspondence, his dazzling out-of-print essay on the art of the short story, and two marvelous examples of his earliest work\u2014his first published story, \"The Judgment of Manitou,\" which Hemingway wrote when still a high school student, and a never-before-published story, written when the author was recovering from a war injury in Milan after WWI. This work offers vital insight into the artistic development of one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. It is a perfect introduction for a new generation of Hemingway readers, and it belongs in the collection of any true Hemingway fan. "

First published in 1927,  Men Without Women  represents some of Hemingway's most important and compelling early writing. In these fourteen stories, Hemingway begins to examine the themes that would occupy his later works: the casualties of war, the often-uneasy relationship between men and women, sport and sportsmanship. In \"Banal Story,\" Hemingway offers a lasting tribute to the famed matador Maera. \"In Another Country\" tells of an Italian major recovering from war wounds as he mourns the untimely death of his wife. \"The Killers\" is the hard-edged story about two Chicago gunmen and their potential victim. Nick Adams makes an appearance in \"Ten Indians,\" in which he is presumably betrayed by his Indian girlfriend, Prudence. And \"Hills Like White Elephants\" is a young couple's subtle, heart-wrenching discussion of abortion. Pared down, gritty, and subtly expressive, these stories show the young Hemingway emerging as America's finest short story writer. "

Set against the looming horrors of the battlefield, this gripping, semiautobiographical work captures the harsh realities of war and the pain of lovers caught in its inexorable sweep.   Hemingway famously rewrote the ending to  A Farewell to Arms  thirty-nine times to get the words right. A classic novel of love during wartime, \" A Farewell to Arms  stands, more than eighty years after its first appearance, as a towering ornament of American literature\" ( The Washington Times ). "

His writing suggests, through the simplest of statements, a sense of moral value and a clarity of vision.

In a scrap heap within an abandoned factory, the greatest invention in history lies dormant and unused. By what fatal error of judgment has its value gone unrecognized, its brilliant inventor punished rather than rewarded for his efforts?  This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world\u2014and did. In defense of those greatest of human qualities that have made civilization possible, he sets out to show what would happen to the world if all the heroes of innovation and industry went on strike. Is he a destroyer or a liberator? Why does he have to fight his battle not against his enemies but against those who need him most? Why does he fight his hardest battle against the woman he loves? The answers will be revealed once you discover the reason behind the baffling events that wreak havoc on the lives of the amazing men and women in this remarkable book.  Tremendous in scope and breathtaking in its suspense, Atlas Shrugged is Ayn rand's magnum opus, which launched an ideology and a movement. With the publication of this work in 1957, Rand gained an instant following and became a phenomenon. Atlas Shrugged emerged as a premier moral apologia for Capitalism, a defense that had an electrifying effect on millions of readers (and now listeners) who had never heard Capitalism defended in other than technical terms.

For centuries, the magnificent Throne of Felipe has stood with two empty spaces beside its famous silver arrow-spaces where the silver castle and lion should have been. And now, with the recent discovery of the silver castle within a secret vault in Seville, Spain, the hunt is on for the third silver icon. With all three pieces in the place, the throne will be enormously valuable-making it a hot item on VILE's radar.

His consistently faithful depiction of these humble people's lives is a major strength of the Emigrant Novels. Moberg's extensive research in the papers of Swedish emigrants in archival collections, including the Minnesota Historical Society, enabled him to incorporate many details of pioneer life. First published between 1949 and 1959 in Swedish, these four books were considered a single work by Moberg, who intended that they be read as documentary novels. These editions contain introductions written by Roger McKnight, Gustavus Adolphus College. Book 1 introduces Karl Oskar and Kristina Nilsson, their three young children, and eleven others who make up a resolute party of Swedes fleeing the poverty, religious persecution, and social oppression of Sm\u00e5land in 1850.

Originally published in Story magazine in 1938, Address Unknown became an international sensation. Credited with exposing the dangers of Nazism to American readers early on, it is also a scathing indictment of fascist movements around the world and a harrowing expos\u00e9 of the power of the pen as a weapon.    A powerful and eloquent tale about the consequences of a friendship\u2014and society\u2014poisoned by extremism, Address Unknown remains hauntingly and painfully relevant today. "

The Giants win the pennant.\"   \u2014 Russ Hodges, October 3, 1951     On the fiftieth anniversary of \"The Shot Heard Round the World,\" Don DeLillo reassembles in fiction the larger-than-life characters who on October 3, 1951, witnessed Bobby Thomson's pennant-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning. Jackie Gleason is razzing Toots Shor in Leo Durocher's box seats; J. Edgar Hoover, basking in Sinatra's celebrity, is about to be told that the Russians have tested an atomic bomb; and Russ Hodges, raw-throated and excitable, announces the game \u2014 the Giants and the Dodgers at the Polo Grounds in New York. DeLillo's transcendent account of one of the iconic events of the twentieth century is a masterpiece of American sportswriting. "

Elizabeth McKenzie, author of THE PORTABLE VEBLEN 'Very smart and juicy and weird and entertaining ... it reads like a chick lit plot written by Franzen' Curtis Sittenfeld Jen has reached her early thirties and has all but abandoned a once-promising painting career when, spurred by the economic crisis, she takes a poorly defined job at a feminist nonprofit. The foundation's aim is to empower women, but staffers spend all their time devising acronyms for imaginary programs, ruthlessly undermining one another, and stroking the ego of their boss, the larger-than-life celebrity philanthropist Leora Infinitas. Jen's complicity in this passive-aggressive hellscape only intensifies her feelings of inferiority compared to her two best friends \u2013 one a wealthy attorney with a picture-perfect family, the other a passionately committed artist \u2013 and so does Jen's apparent inability to have a baby, a source of existential panic that begins to affect her marriage and her already precarious status at the office. Jessica Winter's ferociously intelligent debut novel is a wry satire that explores the difficulty of navigating friendships as they shift to accommodate marriage and family, and the unspoken tensions that can strain even the strongest bonds.

                "A new collection showcasing the best of Ernest Hemingway's short stories including his well-known classics, as featured in the magnificent three-part, six-hour PBS documentary by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick\u2014introduced by award-winning author Tobias Wolff.  Ernest Hemingway, a literary icon and considered one of the greatest American writers of all time, is the subject of a major documentary by award-winning filmmakers Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. This intimate portrait of Hemingway\u2014who brilliantly captured the complexities of the human condition in spare and profound prose, and whose work remains deeply influential in literature and culture\u2014interweaves a close study of biographical events with excerpts from his work.    The Hemingway Stories  features Hemingway's most significant short stories in chronological order, so viewers of the film as well as fans old and new can follow the trajectory of his impressive life and career. Hemingway's beloved classics, such as \"The Short and Happy Life of Francis Macomber,\" \"Up in Michigan,\" \"Indian Camp,\" and \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro,\" are accompanied by fresh insights from renowned writers around the world\u2014Mario Vargas Llosa, Edna O'Brien, Abraham Verghese, Tim O'Brien, and Mary Karr. Tobias Wolff's introduction adds a new perspective to Hemingway's work, and Wolff has selected additional stories that demonstrate Hemingway's talent and range.   The power of Ernest Hemingway's revolutionary style is perhaps most striking in his short stories, and here listeners can encounter the tales that created the legend: stories of men and women in love and in war and on the hunt, stories of a lost generation born into a fractured time. Featuring the voices of Mary Karr, Edna O'Brien, Michael Katakis, and other authors whose insights are heard in the PBS documentary, this audio collection is a perfect introduction for a new generation of Hemingway listeners and a vital volume for any fan.
