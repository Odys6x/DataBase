                "It is natural for us to fear artificial intelligence. But does Siri really want to kill us? Perhaps we are falling into the trap of projecting human traits onto the machines we might build. In  Evolutionary Intelligence , Neuman offers a surprisingly positive vision in which computational intelligence compensates for the well-recognized limits of human judgment, improves decision making, and actually increases our agency. Neuman takes the listener on an exciting, fast-paced ride, all the while making a convincing case about a revolution in computationally augmented human intelligence. Neuman argues that, just as the wheel made us mobile and machines made us stronger, the migration of artificial intelligence from room-sized computers to laptops to our watches, smart glasses, and even smart contact lenses will transform day-to-day human decision making. If intelligence is the capacity to match means with ends, then augmented intelligence can offer the ability to adapt to changing environments as we face the ultimate challenge of long-term survival. Tapping into a global interest in technology's potential impacts on society, economics, and culture,  Evolutionary Intelligence  demonstrates that our future depends on our ability to computationally compensate for the limitations of a human cognitive system that has only recently graduated from hunting and gathering.

                "Skip the iPhone, the iPod, and the Macintosh. If you want to understand how Apple Inc. became an industry behemoth, look no further than the 1977 Apple II. Designed by the engineer Steve Wozniak and hustled into the marketplace by his Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, the Apple II became one of the most prominent personal computers of this dawning industry.   The Apple II was a versatile piece of hardware, but its most compelling story isn't found in the feat of its engineering, the personalities of Apple's founders, or the way it set the stage for the company's multibillion-dollar future. Instead, historian Laine Nooney shows, what made the Apple II iconic was its  software . In software, we discover the material reasons people bought computers. The story of personal computing in the United States is not about the evolution of hackers\u2014it's about the rise of everyday users.   Recounting a constellation of software creation stories, Nooney offers a new understanding of how the hobbyists' microcomputers of the 1970s became the personal computer we know today.  The Apple II Age  offers an unprecedented look at the people, the industry, and the money that built the microcomputing milieu\u2014and why so much of it converged around the pioneering Apple II. "

But these technologies may also extract a cost in attention, money, and privacy. In Threshold, communication and technology expert Heather Suzanne Woods applies rhetorical theory to answer the urgent question of how swiftly proliferating smart homes alter those who inhabit them.Building on research into smart homes in the United States, Woods recounts how smart homes arose and predicts the trajectory of their future form. She pulls back the curtain on the technology, probes who is in control, and questions whether a home can be too smart.Woods suggests a dynamic cultural framework for understanding smart homes that takes into account sociotechnical variables through which smart homes shape human life. Woods's framework reveals how smart homes both reflect social norms about technology as well as whet consumer appetites.Written for homeowners, policymakers, technology enthusiasts, and scholars, Threshold interweaves critical analysis with matter-of-fact graphics that map relationships between digital tools and social life.

Wharton professor Ethan Mollick immediately understood what ChatGPT meant: after millions of years on our own, humans had developed a kind of co-intelligence that could augment, or even replace, human thinking. Through his writing, speaking, and teaching, Mollick has become one of the most prominent and provocative explainers of AI, focusing on the practical aspects of how these new tools for thought can transform our world.\u00a0 In  Co-Intelligence , Mollick urges us to engage with AI as co-worker, co-teacher, and coach. He assesses its profound impact on business and education, using dozens of real-time examples of AI in action.  Co-Intelligence  shows what it means to think and work together with smart machines, and why it's imperative that we master that skill.\u00a0 Mollick challenges us to utilize AI's enormous power without losing our identity, to learn from it without being misled, and to harness its gifts to create a better human future. Wide ranging, hugely thought-provoking, optimistic, and lucid,  Co-Intelligence  reveals the promise and power of this new era. "

                "This audiobook narrated by Daisy Donovan shares an electrifying vision of how we can safeguard AI's future for the public good  Artificial intelligence may be the most transformative technology of our time. As AI's power grows, so does the need to figure out what\u2014and who\u2014this technology is really for.  AI Needs You  argues that it is critical for society to take the lead in answering this urgent question and ensuring that AI fulfills its promise. Verity Harding draws inspiring lessons from the histories of three twentieth-century tech revolutions\u2014the space race, in vitro fertilization, and the internet\u2014to empower each of us to join the conversation about AI and its possible futures. Sharing her perspective as a leading insider in technology and politics, she rejects the dominant narrative, which often likens AI's advent to that of the atomic bomb. History points the way to an achievable future in which democratically determined values guide AI to be peaceful in its intent; to embrace limitations; serve purpose, not profit; and to be firmly rooted in societal trust.  AI Needs You  gives us hope that we, the people, can imbue AI with a deep intentionality that reflects our best values, ideals, and interests, and that serves the public good. AI will permeate our lives in unforeseeable ways, but it is clear that the shape of AI's future\u2014and of our own\u2014cannot be left only to those building it. It is up to us to guide this technology away from our worst fears toward a future that we can trust and believe in. "

                "This audiobook narrated by Anand Jagatia reveals how society can shape individual actions in times of uncertainty  When we make decisions, our thinking is informed by societal norms, \"guardrails\" guiding our decisions, like the laws and rules that govern us. But what are good guardrails in today's world of overwhelming information flows and increasingly powerful technologies, such as artificial intelligence? Based on the latest insights from the cognitive sciences, economics, and public policy,  Guardrails  offers a novel approach to shaping decisions by embracing human agency in its social context. In this visionary book, Urs Gasser and Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger show how the quick embrace of technological solutions can lead to results we don't always want and explain how society itself can provide guardrails more suited to the digital age, ones that empower individual choice while accounting for the social good, encourage flexibility in the face of changing circumstances, and ultimately help us to make better decisions as we tackle the most daunting problems of our times, such as global injustice and climate change. Whether we change jobs, buy a house, or quit smoking, thousands of decisions large and small shape our daily lives. Decisions drive our economies, seal the fate of democracies, create war or peace, and affect the well-being of our planet.  Guardrails  challenges the notion that technology should step in where our own decision making fails, laying out a surprisingly human-centered set of principles that can create new spaces for better decisions and a more equitable and prosperous society.

If you\u2019re going to read only one book about AI, this should be it.\u201d\u2014Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation     Longlisted for the    Inc.    Non-Obvious Book Award  To most of us, it seems like recent developments in artificial intelligence emerged out of nowhere to pose unprecedented threats to humankind. But to Dr. Joy Buolamwini, who has been at the forefront of AI research, this moment has been a long time in the making. After tinkering with robotics as a high school student in Memphis and then developing mobile apps in Zambia as a Fulbright fellow, Buolamwini followed her lifelong passion for computer science, engineering, and art to MIT in 2015. As a graduate student at the \u201cFuture Factory,\u201d she did groundbreaking research that exposed widespread racial and gender bias in AI services from tech giants across the world.  Unmasking AI  goes beyond the headlines about existential risks produced by Big Tech. It is the remarkable story of how Buolamwini uncovered what she calls \u201cthe coded gaze\u201d\u2014the evidence of encoded discrimination and exclusion in tech products\u2014and how she galvanized the movement to prevent AI harms by founding the Algorithmic Justice League. Applying an intersectional lens to both the tech industry and the research sector, she shows how racism, sexism, colorism, and ableism can overlap and render broad swaths of humanity \u201cexcoded\u201d and therefore vulnerable in a world rapidly adopting AI tools. Computers, she reminds us, are reflections of both the aspirations and the limitations of the people who create them. Encouraging experts and non-experts alike to join this fight, Buolamwini writes, \u201cThe rising frontier for civil rights will require algorithmic justice. AI should be for the people and by the people, not just the privileged few.\u201d. "

This book is not for engineers who write the code or the policy makers who claim they can regulate it. This is a book for you. Because, believe it or not, you are the only one that can fix it.   \u2013  Mo Gawdat 'From a brilliant mind comes a terrifying prediction' \u2013 Tim Ash, bestselling author of  Unleash Your Primal Brain   Artificial intelligence is smarter than humans. It can process information at lightning speed and remain focused on specific tasks without distraction. AI can see into the future, predicting outcomes and even use sensors to see around physical and virtual corners. So why does AI frequently get it so wrong? The answer is us. Humans design the algorithms that define the way that AI works, and the processed information reflects an imperfect world. Does that mean we are doomed? In  Scary Smart , Mo Gawdat, the internationally bestselling author of  Solve for Happy , draws on his considerable expertise to answer this question and to show what we can all do now to teach ourselves and our machines how to live better. With more than thirty years' experience working at the cutting-edge of technology and his former role as chief business officer of Google [X], no one is better placed than Mo Gawdat to explain how the Artificial Intelligence of the future works. By 2049 AI will be a billion times more intelligent than humans.  Scary Smart  explains how to fix the current trajectory now, to make sure that the AI of the future can preserve our species. This book offers a blueprint, pointing the way to what we can do to safeguard ourselves, those we love and the planet itself. "

Do you skim articles on your screen in search of intellectual stimulation that never arrives? If so, this book is the philosophical lifeline you have been waiting for. Offering a timely meditation on the profound effects of constant immersion in technology, also known as the Interface, Wish I Were Here draws on philosophical analysis of boredom and happiness to examine the pressing issues of screen addiction and the lure of online outrage. Without moralizing, Mark Kingwell takes seriously the possibility that current conditions of life and connection are creating hollowed-out human selves, divorced from their own external world. While scrolling, swiping, and clicking suggest purposeful action, such as choosing and connecting with others, Kingwell argues that repeated flicks of the finger provide merely the shadow of meaning, by reducing us to scattered data fragments, Twitter feeds, Instagram posts, shopping preferences, and text trends captured by algorithms. Written in accessible language that references both classical philosophers and contemporary critics, Wish I Were Here turns to philosophy for a cure to the widespread unease that something is amiss in modern waking life.

Progress depends on the choices we make about technology. New ways of organizing production and communication can either serve the narrow interests of an elite or become the foundation for widespread prosperity.    The wealth generated by technological improvements in agriculture during the European Middle Ages was captured by the nobility and used to build grand cathedrals while peasants remained on the edge of starvation. The first hundred years of industrialization in England delivered stagnant incomes for working people. And throughout the world today, digital technologies and artificial intelligence undermine jobs and democracy through excessive automation, massive data collection, and intrusive surveillance.    It doesn't have to be this way.  Power and Progress  demonstrates that the path of technology was once\u2014and may again be\u2014brought under control. The tremendous computing advances of the last half century can become empowering and democratizing tools, but not if all major decisions remain in the hands of a few hubristic tech leaders.    With their breakthrough economic theory and manifesto for a better society, Acemoglu and Johnson provide the vision needed to reshape how we innovate and who really gains from technological advances.

While it is a story about a family, it is really the story of technological and global changes unfolding on our doorsteps. While many revile the ascendance of smartphones and social media and the way they suck us into the vortex of cyberspace, there are cultural touchpoints that reflect deeper human and technology development patterns, patterns which we would all do well to understand, no matter whether or how we choose to engage in the ever-innovating digital frontiers. Informed by research and interviews with leaders in policy, human development, ethics, and technology, Loretta Brady helps listeners understand the complex systemic challenges and findings related to technology and human development. We do not have to hate or fear technology. It is neither friend nor foe. But understanding its impact on our daily lives is paramount to cultivating a healthier relationship both with our digital lives and our real, lived ones. "

Unfortunately, according to the world's pre-eminent AI expert, it could also be the last.  In this groundbreaking book on the biggest question facing humanity, Stuart Russell explains why he has come to consider his own discipline an existential threat to his own species, and lays out how we can change course before it's too late. There is no one better placed to assess the promise and perils of the dominant technology of the future than Russell, who has spent decades at the forefront of AI research. Through brilliant analogies and crisp, lucid prose, he explains how AI actually works, how it has an enormous capacity to improve our lives - but why we must ensure that we never lose control of machines more powerful than we are. Here Russell shows how we can avert the worst threats by reshaping the foundations of AI to guarantee that machines pursue  our  objectives, not  theirs .  Profound, urgent and visionary,  Human Compatible  is the one book everyone needs to read to understand a future that is coming sooner than we think. "

Our devices and apps can make life much more convenient and entertaining.  But for years, scientists have warned that too much screen time may have negative effects on our health. With portable devices and remote learning, it is even more difficult to put down electronics. Being intentional about how and when to unplug can help teens and young adults to protect their physical and mental wellbeing in a world where screens and technology are increasingly becoming necessities rather than just conveniences.  Attention Hijacked offers a roadmap for those deciding how they want to deal with technology, exploring the ways technology affects the individual, dispelling common misinformation, and using this knowledge to make personalized decisions.

From the Egyptians, whose conception of death inspired them to build the pyramids, to modern-day sports fans, whose passion for a game inspires extreme behavior, humans have long sought to supplement their day-to-day lives with a rich diversity of alternative experiences. Rooting his vision in history and psychology, Narula argues that humans\u2019 intrinsic need for autonomy, accomplishment, and connection can best be met in virtual \u201cworlds of ideas,\u201d where users have the chance to create and exchange meaning and value. The metaverse is both the growing set of fulfilling digital experiences\u2014ranging from advanced gaming to concerts and other entertainment events and even to virtual employment\u2014and the empowering framework that allows these spaces to become \u201cnetworks of useful meaning.\u201d  Bloomberg Intelligence  recently predicted that the metaverse will become an $800 billon industry by 2024. But its implications, argues Narula,\u00a0will lead to\u00a0far more awe-inspiring possibilities than a spigot of cash.\u00a0The arrival of the metaverse marks the beginning of a new age of exploration\u2014not outward, but inward\u2014with the potential to reshape society and open the door to a new understanding of the human species and its capabilities. Rigorously researched and passionately argued,  Virtual Society  is a provocative and essential guide for anyone who wants to go beyond superficial headlines to understand the true contours and potential of our virtual future.

Whether working with our teams and customers or communicating with our families and friends, it is increasingly difficult to break through the digital devices that get in the way of communication. And the ubiquity of digital devices means that we are often \"multicommunicating,\" participating in multiple conversations at once. As a result, our ability to be socially present with an audience requires an intentional approach. This increased strain on attention has never been more clear than during the global pandemic, when our homes suddenly accommodated both work and family life. What are our options when facing professional communications at all hours? Do we ask for the technology to be put away at the dinner table? Establish other ground rules? What about using digital communications to our advantage-how can we facilitate information-sharing in the midst of a world where we are overwhelmed with content?. "

                "An empowering, forward-thinking solution for creating intentional and healthy social media habits from an expert on media, technology and health.  Internationally acclaimed behavioral scientist and social media expert Brian Primack, MD, PhD, believes we do not need to swear off social media, delete all our online accounts, or give up our phones to live healthier, happier lives. In  You Are What You Click , he offers a new approach to digital wellness, and a realist's perspective on how what we consume online affects our well-being. In response, he presents a \"social media pyramid\" that personalizes our tech diet so we can enjoy a fruitful, balanced relationship with social media. While many of us turn to social media looking for a sense of connection and comfort, the data show that it may paradoxically leave us feeling more alone and depressed. Drawing on over twenty years of original research, Dr. Primack explains the fascinating nuances of our relationship with social media, its impact on our mental health, and the dangers of social media using us instead of the other way around. He empowers us to take back control with a simple method: being more selective, positive, and creative with our lives online. Dr. Primack introduces surprising strategies you can use right away to fine-tune your online experience and discover  your  definition of digital balance. Through short, actionable chapters, you'll learn how to: \u2022  Tailor  your social media use to your personality. \u2022  Select  positive relationships over toxic ones. \u2022  Overcome  comparison syndrome and the fear of missing out. \u2022  Fill  your feed with meaningful, humorous, and uplifting content. \u2022  Optimize  your news intake and resist doomscrolling. \u2022  Improve  your sleep, create \"tech holidays,\" and more. With innovative strategies for managing technology, you'll transform your relationship with tech and discover how to make social media work for you.   You Are What You Click  offers a science-backed approach from a credentialed doctor:  Dr. Brian Primack has an MD and a PhD in Education and Behavioral Science. Primack is the go-to expert on this topic. His work on the intersection of media and health has been cited nearly 6,000 times in peer-reviewed scholarly literature, and he has been featured in major media outlets across the world.  FOR WELLNESS READERS, PARENTS, AND ANYONE WHO USES SOCIAL MEDIA:  Dropping off the digital map or deleting all our social media accounts isn't the only option\u2014and often isn't something we feel ready to do. Rather than digital abstinence, with Primack's 3-step plan, tech lovers will be able to understand how to regulate their online social platforms in healthier ways.  A BALANCED PERSPECTIVE ON TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA IN A POSITIVE LIGHT:  Almost every book in this genre portrays technology in a negative or even scary way. With this book, readers will learn how to adjust and balance their presence online with a personalized plan they can use across all platforms, no matter what new social media app goes public next. Primack offers an empowering solution that is forward-thinking, and will continue to be relevant as technology becomes more immersed into our lives.  QUICK, PRACTICAL ADVICE:  You Are What You Click  is broken into short, actionable chapters that allow readers to understand the research, take action, and see results\u2014perfect for short attention spans whittled down by Facebook and Instagram stories, Twitter, Snapchat, and TikTok!

At home, feeling stressed, you take pills both invented and prescribed by AI to keep your blood pressure in check. You stream a video starring \"actors\" generated by machine. And before you turn in, you wonder if collaboration between Big Tech and China means you should choose a new AI provider for your home. As Martin Ford shows in  Rule of the Robots , AI will soon flow through our lives like electricity does today, remaking every sphere of human activity. Yet even as Ford maps out AI's disquieting future, he shows how we can prepare for it, advocating for policies such as universal basic income and educational reform.

Stewart convincingly shows that emergency software patches and new security products cannot provide the solution to threats such as computer hacking, viruses, software vulnerabilities, and electronic spying. Profound underlying structural problems must first be understood, confronted, and then addressed. A Vulnerable System delivers a long view of the history of information security, beginning with the creation of the first digital computers during the Cold War. From the key institutions of the so-called military industrial complex in the 1950s to Silicon Valley start-ups in the 2020s, the relentless pursuit of new technologies has come at great cost. The absence of knowledge regarding the history of information security has caused the lessons of the past to be forsaken for the novelty of the present, and has led us to be collectively unable to meet the needs of the current day. From the very beginning of the information age, claims of secure systems have been crushed by practical reality. The myriad risks to technology, Stewart reveals, cannot be addressed without first understanding how we arrived at this moment. A Vulnerable System is an enlightening and sobering history of a topic that affects crucial aspects of our lives. "

                "A forward-thinking manifesto from three Stanford professors\u2014experts who have worked at ground zero of the tech revolution for decades\u2014which reveals how big tech's obsession with optimization and efficiency has sacrificed fundamental human values and outlines steps we can take to change course, renew our democracy, and save ourselves.  In no more than the blink of an eye, a na\u00efve optimism about technology's liberating potential has given way to a dystopian obsession with biased algorithms, surveillance capitalism, and job-displacing robots. Yet too few of us see any alternative to accepting the onward march of technology. We have simply accepted a technological future designed for us by technologists, the venture capitalists who fund them, and the politicians who give them free rein.  It doesn't need to be this way.  System Error exposes the root of our current predicament: how big tech's relentless focus on optimization is driving a future that reinforces discrimination, erodes privacy, displaces workers, and pollutes the information we get. This optimization mindset substitutes what companies care about for the values that we as a democratic society might choose to prioritize. Well-intentioned optimizers fail to measure all that is meaningful and, when their creative disruptions achieve great scale, they impose their values upon the rest of us.  Armed with an understanding of how technologists think and exercise their power, three Stanford professors\u2014a philosopher working at the intersection of tech and ethics, a political scientist who served under Obama, and the director of the undergraduate Computer Science program at Stanford (also an early Google engineer)\u2014reveal how we can hold that power to account.  Troubled by the values that permeate the university's student body and its culture, they worked together to chart a new path forward, creating a popular course to transform how tomorrow's technologists approach their profession. Now, as the dominance of big tech becomes an explosive societal conundrum, they share their provocative insights and concrete solutions to help everyone understand what is happening, what is at stake, and what we can do to control technology instead of letting it control us.

                "A Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist's journey into a billon-dollar secret industry that is shaping our world \u2013 the booming business of private spying, operatives-for-hire retained by companies, political parties and the powerful to dig up dirt on their enemies and, if need be, destroy them.    For decades, private eyes from Allan Pinkerton, who formed the first detective agency in the U.S., to Jules Kroll, who transformed the investigations business by giving it a corporate veneer, private spies were content to stand in the shadows. Now, that is all changing. High-profile stories grabbing recent headlines \u2013 the Steele Dossier, Black Cube, the Theranos scandal, Harvey Weinstein's attacks on his accusers \u2013 all share a common thread, the involvement of private spies.  Today, operatives-for-hire are influencing presidential elections, the news media, government policies and the fortunes of companies. They are also peering into our personal lives as never before, using off-the shelf technology to listen to our phone calls, monitor our emails, and decide what we see on social media. Private spying has never been cheaper and the business has never been more lucrative\u2014just as its power has never been more pervasive.  Spooked is a fast-paced, disturbing and, at times, hilarious tour through the shadowlands of private spying and its inhabitants, a grab-bag collection of ex-intelligence operatives, former journalists and lost souls. In this hidden world, information is currency, double-crosses are commonplace, and hacking can be standard procedure. Drawing on his journalistic expertise and unique access to sources, Barry Meier uncovers the secrets private spies want to keep hidden.   Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

                "AI is poised to disrupt our work and our lives. We can harness these technologies rather than fall captive to them-but only through wise regulation. Too many CEOs tell a simple story about the future of work: if a machine can do what you do, your job will be automated. They envision everyone from doctors to soldiers rendered superfluous by ever-more-powerful AI. They offer stark alternatives: make robots or be replaced by them. Another story is possible. In virtually every walk of life, robotic systems can make labor more valuable, not less. Frank Pasquale tells the story of nurses, teachers, designers, and others who partner with technologists, rather than meekly serving as data sources for their computerized replacements. This cooperation reveals the kind of technological advance that could bring us all better health care, education, and more, while maintaining meaningful work. These partnerships also show how law and regulation can promote prosperity for all, rather than a zero-sum race of humans against machines. "

                "From FSGO x Logic: stories about rural China, food, and tech that reveal new truths about the globalized world  In  Blockchain Chicken Farm , the technologist and writer Xiaowei Wang explores the political and social entanglements of technology in rural China. Their discoveries force them to challenge the standard idea that rural culture and people are backward, conservative, and intolerant. Instead, they find that rural China has not only adapted to rapid globalization but has actually innovated the technology we all use today. From pork farmers using AI to produce the perfect pig, to disruptive luxury counterfeits and the political intersections of e-commerce villages, Wang unravels the ties between globalization, technology, agriculture, and commerce in unprecedented fashion. Accompanied by humorous \"Sinofuturist\" recipes that frame meals as they transform under new technology,  Blockchain Chicken Farm  is an original and probing look into innovation, connectivity, and collaboration in the digitized rural world. FSG Originals \u00d7 Logic dissects the way technology functions in everyday lives. The titans of Silicon Valley, for all their utopian imaginings, never really had our best interests at heart: recent threats to democracy, truth, privacy, and safety, as a result of tech's reckless pursuit of progress, have shown as much. We present an alternate story, one that delights in capturing technology in all its contradictions and innovation, across borders and socioeconomic divisions, from history through the future, beyond platitudes and PR hype, and past doom and gloom. Our collaboration features four brief but provocative forays into the tech industry's many worlds, and aspires to incite fresh conversations about technology focused on nuanced and accessible explorations of the emerging tools that reorganize and redefine life today.

                "\"This colorful page-turner puts artificial intelligence into a human perspective. Through the lives of Geoff Hinton and other major players, Metz explains this transformative technology and makes the quest thrilling.\"  \u2014Walter Isaacson,  author of  The Code Breaker      Recipient of starred reviews in both  Kirkus  and  Library Journal      THE UNTOLD TECH STORY OF OUR TIME   \u00a0  What does it mean to be smart? To be human? What do we really want from life and the intelligence we have, or might create?  \u00a0  With deep and exclusive reporting, across hundreds of interviews,  New York Times  Silicon Valley journalist Cade Metz brings you into the rooms where these questions are being answered. Where an extraordinarily powerful new artificial intelligence has been built into our biggest companies, our social discourse, and our daily lives, with few of us even noticing.\u00a0   \u00a0  Long dismissed as a technology of the distant future, artificial intelligence was a project consigned to the fringes of the scientific community. Then two researchers changed everything. One was a sixty-four-year-old computer science professor who didn\u2019t drive and didn\u2019t fly because he could no longer sit down\u2014but still made his way across North America for the moment that would define a new age of technology. The other was a thirty-six-year-old neuroscientist and chess prodigy who laid claim to being the greatest game player of all time before vowing to build a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.  \u00a0  They took two very different paths to that lofty goal, and they disagreed on how quickly it would arrive. But both were soon drawn into the heart of the tech industry. Their ideas drove a new kind of arms race, spanning Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and OpenAI, a new lab founded by Silicon Valley kingpin Elon Musk. But some believed that China would beat them all to the finish line.  \u00a0   Genius Makers  dramatically presents the fierce conflict between national interests, shareholder value, the pursuit of scientific knowledge, and the very human concerns about privacy, security, bias, and prejudice. Like a great Victorian novel, this world of eccentric, brilliant, often unimaginably yet suddenly wealthy characters draws you into the most profound moral questions we can ask. And like a great mystery, it presents the story and facts that lead to a core, vital question:  \u00a0  How far will we let it go?. "

                "Everywhere we turn, a startling new device promises to transfigure our lives. But at what cost? In this urgent and revelatory excavation of our Information Age, leading technology thinker Adam Greenfield forces us to reconsider our relationship with the networked objects, services, and spaces that define us. It is time to re-evaluate the Silicon Valley consensus determining the future. We're told that innovations-from augmented-reality interfaces and virtual assistants to autonomous delivery drones and self-driving cars-will make life easier, more convenient, and more productive. 3D printing promises unprecedented control over the form and distribution of matter, while the blockchain stands to revolutionize everything from the recording and exchange of value to the way we organize the mundane realities of the day to day. And, all the while, fiendishly complex algorithms are operating quietly in the background, reshaping the economy, transforming the fundamental terms of our politics, and even redefining what it means to be human. Having successfully colonized everyday life, these radical technologies are now conditioning the choices available to us in the years to come. Greenfield's timely guide clarifies the scale and nature of the crisis we now confront-and offers ways to reclaim our stake in the future. "

In  How to Speak Machine , he offers a set of simple laws that govern not only the computers of today, but the unimaginable machines of the future.  Technology is already more powerful than we can comprehend, and getting more powerful at an exponential pace. Once set in motion, algorithms never tire. And when a program's size, speed, and tirelessness combine with its ability to learn and transform itself, the outcome can be unpredictable and dangerous. Take the seemingly instant transformation of Microsoft's chatbot Tay into a hate-spewing racist, or how crime-predicting algorithms reinforce racial bias.  How to Speak Machine  provides a coherent framework for today's product designers, business leaders, and policymakers to grasp this brave new world. Drawing on his wide-ranging experience from engineering to computer science to design, Maeda shows how businesses and individuals can identify opportunities afforded by technology to make world-changing and inclusive products\u2014while avoiding the pitfalls inherent to the medium.

At Amazon, \"Day One\" is code for inventing like a startup, with little regard for legacy. Day Two is, in Jeff Bezos's own words, is \"stasis, followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciating, painful decline, followed by death.\"   Most companies today are set up for Day Two. They build advantages and defend them fiercely, rather than invent the future. But Amazon and fellow tech titans Facebook, Google, and Microsoft are operating in Day One: they prioritize reinvention over tradition and collaboration over ownership.  Through 130 interviews with insiders, from Mark Zuckerberg to hourly workers, Always Day One reveals the tech giants' blueprint for sustainable success in a business world where no advantage is safe. Companies today can spin up new products at record speed \u2014 thanks to artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 and those who stand still will be picked apart. The tech giants remain dominant because they've built cultures that spark continual reinvention.  It might sound radical, but those who don't act like it's always day one do so at their own peril. Kantrowitz uncovers the engine propelling the tech giants' continued dominance at a stage when most big companies begin to decline. And he shows the way forward for everyone who wants to compete with\u2014and beat\u2014the titans. "

These mismatches are the building blocks of exclusion. In Mismatch, Kat Holmes describes how design can lead to exclusion, and how design can also remedy exclusion. Holmes tells stories of pioneers of inclusive design, many of whom were drawn to work on inclusion because of their own experiences of exclusion. A gamer and designer who depends on voice recognition shows Holmes his \"Wall of Exclusion,\" which displays dozens of game controllers that require two hands to operate; an architect shares her firsthand knowledge of how design can fail communities; an astronomer who began to lose her eyesight adapts a technique called \"sonification\" so she can \"listen\" to the stars. Designing for inclusion is not a feel-good sideline. Holmes shows how inclusion can be a source of innovation and growth, especially for digital technologies. It can be a catalyst for creativity and a boost for the bottom line as a customer base expands. And each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we create an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways. "

Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in  Jeopardy!  does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements in the field thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence.  The real world, in contrast, is wildly complex and open-ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Taking inspiration from the human mind, Marcus and Davis explain what we need to advance AI to the next level, and suggest that if we are wise along the way, we won't need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we focus on endowing machines with common sense and deep understanding, rather than simply focusing on statistical analysis and gatherine ever larger collections of data, we will be able to create an AI we can trust\u2014in our homes, our cars, and our doctors' offices.  Rebooting AI  provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of how a new generation of AI can make our lives better. "

What robot and AI systems are being built and imagined right now? What do they say about us, their creators? Will they usher in a fantastic new future, or destroy us? What do some of our greatest thinkers, from physicist Brian Greene and futurist Kevin Kelly to inventor Dean Kamen, geneticist George Church, and filmmaker Tiffany Shlain, anticipate about our human-robot future? For even as robots and A.I. intrigue us and make us anxious about the future, our fascination with robots has always been about more than the potential of the technology\u2013it's also about what robots tell us about being human.

                "Science world luminary John Brockman assembles twenty-five of the most important scientific minds, people who have been thinking about the field artificial intelligence for most of their careers, for an unparalleled round-table examination about mind, thinking, intelligence and what it means to be human.\"Artificial intelligence is today's story\u2014the story behind all other stories. It is the Second Coming and the Apocalypse at the same time: Good AI versus evil AI.\" \u2014John BrockmanMore than sixty years ago, mathematician-philosopher Norbert Wiener published a book on the place of machines in society that ended with a warning: \"we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions.... The hour is very late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door.\" In the wake of advances in unsupervised, self-improving machine learning, a small but influential community of thinkers is considering Wiener's words again. In Possible Minds, John Brockman gathers their disparate visions of where AI might be taking us.The fruit of the long history of Brockman's profound engagement with the most important scientific minds who have been thinking about AI\u2014from Alison Gopnik and David Deutsch to Frank Wilczek and Stephen Wolfram\u2014Possible Minds is an ideal introduction to the landscape of crucial issues AI presents. The collision between opposing perspectives is salutary and exhilarating; some of these figures, such as computer scientist Stuart Russell, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and physicist Max Tegmark, are deeply concerned with the threat of AI, including the existential one, while others, notably robotics entrepreneur Rodney Brooks, philosopher Daniel Dennett, and bestselling author Steven Pinker, have a very different view. Serious, searching and authoritative, Possible Minds lays out the intellectual landscape of one of the most important topics of our time.Read by Jason Culp, Rob Shapiro, Vikas Adam, Will Damron, and Kathleen McInerney.

The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth.Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new \"behavioral futures markets,\" where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new \"means of behavioral modification.\"The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a \"Big Other\" operating in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff's comprehensive and moving analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled \"hive\" of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for maximum profit\u2014at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future.With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital future\u2014if we let it.

But you probably haven't yet realized the extent to which this technology will change the way we live. We used to be bound to a physical reality, but new immersive computer simulations allow us to escape our homes and bodies. Suddenly anyone can see what it's like to stand on the peak of Mount Everest. A person who can't walk can experience a marathon from the perspective of an Olympic champion. And why stop there? Become a dragon and fly through the universe. But it's not only about spectacle. Virtual and augmented reality will impact nearly every aspect of our lives\u2014commerce, medicine, politics\u2014the applications are infinite. It may sound like science fiction, but this vision of the future drives billions of dollars in business and is a top priority for such companies as Facebook, Google, and Sony. Yet little is known about the history of these technologies. In Defying Reality, David M. Ewalt traces the story from ancient amphitheaters to Cold War military laboratories, through decades of hype and failure, to a nineteen-year-old video game aficionado who made the impossible possible. Ewalt looks at how businesses are already using this tech to revolutionize the world around us, and what we can expect in the future. Writing for a mainstream audience as well as for technology enthusiasts, Ewalt offers a unique perspective on VR. With firsthand accounts and on-the-ground reporting, Defying Reality shows how virtual reality will change our work, our play, and the way we relate to one another. "

These machines, from smart phones to talking robots to self-driving cars, are remaking the world of the 21st century in the same way that the Industrial Revolution remade the world of the 19th century.AIQ, by Nick Polson and James Scott, is based on a simple premise: if you want to understand the modern world, then you have to know a little bit of the mathematical language spoken by intelligent machines. AIQ will teach listeners that language&amp;#8212;but in an unconventional way, anchored in stories rather than mathematics.Listeners will meet a fascinating cast of historical characters who have a lot to teach about data, probability, and better thinking. Along the way, listeners will see how these same ideas are playing out in the modern age of big data and intelligent machines&amp;#8212;and how these technologies will soon help them to overcome some of their built-in cognitive weaknesses, giving them a chance to lead happier, healthier, more fulfilled lives.

                "Virtual reality is able to effectively blur the line between reality and illusion, pushing the limits of our imagination and granting us access to any experience imaginable. With well-crafted simulations, these experiences, which are so immersive that the brain believes they're real, are already widely available with a VR headset and will only become more accessible and commonplace. But how does this new medium affect its users, and does it have a future beyond fantasy and escapism?In Experience on Demand, Jeremy Bailenson draws on two decades spent researching the psychological effects of VR and other mass media to help readers understand this powerful new tool. He offers expert guidelines for interacting with VR and describes the profound ways this technology can be put to use-not to distance ourselves from reality, but to enrich our lives and influence us to treat others, the environment, and even ourselves better. In the world of VR, a football quarterback plays a game against a competing team hundreds of times before even stepping onto the field; members of the United Nations embody a young girl in a refugee camp going through her day-to-day life; and veterans once again walk through the streets where they had experienced trauma.There are dangers and many unknowns in using VR, but it also can help us hone our performance, recover from trauma, improve our learning and communication abilities, and enhance our empathic and imaginative capacities. Like any new technology, its most incredible uses might be waiting just around the corner. Experience on Demand is the definitive look at the risks and potential of VR-a must-read for navigating both the virtual and the physical worlds ahead. "

Merchant forces us to dig deep, into the book and ourselves, and it goes beyond self-knowledge and self-empowerment, obliterating the fear of otherness with an understanding of the onlyness of us all.\" &#8212;Sally Haldorson, 800-CEO-READ An innovation expert illuminates why your power to make a difference is no longer bound by your statusIf you're like most people, you wish you had the ability to make a difference, but you don't have the credentials, or a seat at the table, can't get past the gatekeepers, and aren't high enough in any hierarchy to get your ideas heard.In The Power of Onlyness, Nilofer Merchant, one of the world's top-ranked business thinkers, reveals that, in fact, we have now reached an unprecedented moment of opportunity for your ideas to \"make a dent\" on the world. Now that the Internet has liberated ideas to spread through networks instead of hierarchies, power is no longer determined by your status, but by \"onlyness\"&#8212;that spot in the world only you stand in, a function of your distinct history and experiences, visions and hopes. If you build upon your signature ingredient of purpose and connect with those who are equally passionate, you have a lever by which to move the world. This new ability is already within your grasp, but to command it, you need to know how to meaningfully mobilize others around your ideas. Through inspirational and instructive stories, Merchant reveals proven strategies to unleash the centrifugal force of a new idea, no matter how weird or wild it may seem. Imagine how much better the world could be if every idea could have its shot, not just the ones that come from expected people and places. Which long-intractable problems would we solve, what new levels of creativity would be unlocked, and who might innovate a breakthrough that could benefit ourselves, our communities, and especially our economy. This limitless potential of onlyness has already been recognized by Thinkers 50, the Oscars of management, which cited it one of the five ideas that will shape business for next twenty years.Why do some individuals make scalable impact with their ideas, regardless of their power or status? The Power of Onlyness unravels this mystery for the first time so that anyone can make a dent. Even you. "

Technological advances have benefited our world in immeasurable ways--but there is an ominous flip side. Criminals are often the earliest, and most innovative, adopters of technology, and modern times have lead to modern crimes. Today's criminals are stealing identities, draining online bank accounts and wiping out computer servers. It's disturbingly easy to activate baby monitors to spy on families, pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt of electricity, and thieves are analyzing your social media in order to determine the best time for a home invasion.

They now influence developments and discoveries in chemistry, biology, and physics\u2014the study of genomes, extra-solar planets, even the intricacies of quantum systems.\u00a0And all this before large language models such as ChatGPT came on the scene. We are living through a revolution in machine learning-powered AI that shows no signs of slowing down. This technology is based on relatively simple mathematical ideas, some of which go back centuries, including linear algebra and calculus, the stuff of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century mathematics. It took the birth and advancement of computer science and the kindling of 1990s computer chips designed for video games to ignite the explosion of AI that we see today. In this enlightening book, Anil Ananthaswamy explains the fundamental math behind machine learning, while suggesting intriguing links between artifical and natural intelligence. Might the same math underpin them both? As Ananthaswamy resonantly concludes, to make safe and effective use of artificial intelligence, we need to understand its profound capabilities and limitations, the clues to which lie in the math that makes machine learning possible.  *This audiobook contains a PDF of equations, graphs, and illustrations.

                "The global battle among the three dominant digital powers\u2014the United States, China, and the European Union\u2014is intensifying. All three regimes are racing to regulate tech companies, with each advancing a competing vision for the digital economy while attempting to expand its sphere of influence in the digital world. In  Digital Empires , her provocative follow-up to  The Brussels Effect , Anu Bradford explores a rivalry that will shape the world in the decades to come. Across the globe, people dependent on digital technologies have become increasingly alarmed that their rapid adoption and transformation have ushered in an exceedingly concentrated economy where a few powerful companies control vast economic wealth and political power, undermine data privacy, and widen the gap between economic winners and losers. Bradford examines three competing regulatory approaches\u2014the American market-driven model, the Chinese state-driven model, and the European rights-driven regulatory model\u2014and discusses how governments and tech companies navigate the inevitable conflicts that arise when these regulatory approaches collide.  Digital Empires  lays bare the choices we face as societies and individuals, explains the forces that shape those choices, and illuminates the immense stakes involved for everyone who uses digital technologies.

                "A  Fortune  magazine journalist draws on his expertise and extensive contacts among the companies and scientists at the forefront of artificial intelligence to offer dramatic predictions of AI's impact over the next decade, from reshaping our economy and the way we work, learn, and create to unknitting our social fabric, jeopardizing our democracy, and fundamentally altering the way we think.  Within the next five years, Jeremy Kahn predicts, AI will disrupt almost every industry and enterprise, with vastly increased efficiency and productivity. It will restructure the workforce, making AI copilots a must for every knowledge worker. It will revamp education, meaning children around the world can have personal, portable tutors. It will revolutionize health care, making individualized, targeted pharmaceuticals more affordable. It will compel us to reimagine how we make art, compose music, and write and publish books. The potential of generative AI to extend our skills, talents, and creativity as humans is undeniably exciting and promising.   But while this new technology has a bright future, it also casts a dark and fearful shadow. AI will provoke pervasive, disruptive, potentially devastating knock-on effects. Leveraging his unrivaled access to the leaders, scientists, futurists, and others who are making AI a reality, Kahn will argue that if not carefully designed and vigilantly regulated AI will deepen income inequality, depressing wages while imposing winner-take-all markets across much of the economy. AI risks undermining democracy, as truth is overtaken by misinformation, racial bias, and harmful stereotypes. Continuing a process begun by the internet, AI will rewire our brains, likely inhibiting our ability to think critically, to remember, and even to get along with one another\u2014unless we all take decisive action to prevent this from happening.   Much as Michael Lewis's classic  The New New Thing  offered a prescient, insightful, and eminently readable account of life inside the dot-com bubble,  Mastering AI  delivers much-needed guidance for anyone eager to understand the AI boom\u2014and what comes next.

                "Hope for the future lies with a new generation of regenerative farmers.  Within a decade, nearly half of all American farmland will change hands as an older generation of farmers steps aside. In their place, a groundswell of new growers will face numerous challenges, including soil degradation, insufficient income, and investors devouring farmland at a staggering pace. These new farmers are embracing regenerative agriculture\u2014the holistic approach to growing food that restores the soil and biodiversity\u2014in the movement to reclaim our health and the planet's. But can their efforts help reverse an epidemic of diet-related disease, food inequality, and even climate change? To answer that question and more, award-winning journalist Jennifer Grayson embedded herself in a groundbreaking farmer training program, then embarked on this investigative journey. The diverse array of farmers, graziers, and food activists whom she profiles here are working toward better, more sustainable foodways for all. From a one-acre market garden in Oregon to activists reviving food sovereignty in South Carolina,  A Call to Farms  tells the captivating story of these new agrarians finding hope and purpose in reconnecting to the land and striving to improve the future of American food.

The company had been humiliated by headlines, painted as complicit in the manipulation of democratic voting and an assault on the global social fabric. Their stated mission was to connect people, but they couldn't afford to destroy society in the process. And so they hired a small team to make sure they didn't repeat the same mistakes. From the Wall Street Journal reporter whose explosive stories have rocked Facebook and its leadership, this is the story of the Civic Integrity Team: a select band of engineers, coders, economists, and experts hired to peer inside the company's secretive algorithms for the first time and find out what exactly was going wrong. They were successful. Too successful. The Integrity unit discovered proof that Facebook distorted and amplified the basest of human impulses. The company was not merely providing a platform for bad actors but amplifying their power for profit. Enduring personal trauma and professional resistance in their often lonely and dark investigations, the Integrity team nevertheless isolated many of Facebook's worst problems, complete with tentative and hopeful steps to solve them - only to discover that they were set up to fail, and would have to take matters into their own hands. \u00a92023 Jeff Horwitz (P)2023 Penguin Audio.

Interrogating the historical currents that have brought us here, Harkness envisages a messier, riskier and less comfortable world than the one into which we're sliding.

Challenger  is a remarkable book.\" \u2014 The Atlantic     \"Superb...Compelling and exhaustively researched.\" \u2014 The Washington Post    \"Devastating...A universal story that transcends time.\" \u2014 The New York Times    \"Gripping history.\" \u2014 Publishers Weekly  (starred review)      From the  New York Times  bestselling author of  Midnight in Chernobyl  comes the definitive, dramatic, minute-by-minute story of the  Challenger  disaster, based on fascinating in-depth reporting and new archival research\u2014a riveting history that reads like a thriller.   On January 28, 1986, just seventy-three seconds into flight, the space shuttle  Challenger  broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, killing all seven people on board. Millions of Americans witnessed the tragic deaths of the crew, which included New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. Like the assassination of JFK, the  Challenger  disaster is a defining moment in twentieth-century history\u2014one that forever changed the way America thought of itself and its optimistic view of the future. Yet the full story of what happened, and why, has never been told.   Based on extensive archival research and metic\u00adulous, original reporting,  Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space  follows a handful of central protagonists\u2014including each of the seven members of the doomed crew\u2014through the years leading up to the accident, and offers a detailed account of the tragedy itself and the inves\u00adtigation afterward. It's a compelling tale of ambition and ingenuity undermined by political cynicism and cost-cutting in the interests of burnishing national prestige; of hubris and heroism; and of an investigation driven by leakers and whistleblowers determined to bring the truth to light. Throughout, there are the ominous warning signs of a tragedy to come, recognized but then ignored, and later hidden from the public.   Higginbotham reveals the history of the shuttle program and the lives of men and women whose stories have been overshadowed by the disaster, as well as the designers, engineers, and test pilots who struggled against the odds to get the first shuttle into space. A masterful blend of riveting human drama and fascinating and absorbing science,  Challenger  identifies a turning point in history\u2014and brings to life an even more complex and astonishing story than we remember.

                "\"The guerrilla fights the war of the flea, and his military enemy suffers the dog's disadvantages: too much to defend; too small, ubiquitous, and agile an enemy to come to grips with.\" With these words, Robert Taber began a revolution in conventional military thought that has dramatically impacted the way armed conflicts have been fought since the book's initial publication in 1965.  Whether ideological, nationalistic, or religious, all guerrilla insurgencies use similar tactics to advance their cause.   War of the Flea's   timeless analysis of the guerrilla fighter's means and methods provides a fundamental resource for any reader seeking to understand this distinct form of warfare and the challenge it continues to present to today's armed forces in the Philippines, Colombia, and elsewhere.

How have we allowed the proliferation of alternative facts,\u00a0hoaxes,\u00a0even conspiracy theories, to destroy our trust in institutions, leaders, and legitimate experts?\u00a0Best-selling journalist\u00a0Steven Brill documents the forces and people, from Silicon Valley to Madison Avenue to Moscow\u00a0to Washington, that have created\u00a0and exploited\u00a0this world of chaos and division\u2014and\u00a0offers\u00a0practical\u00a0solutions for\u00a0what we can do about it. \"A precise description of the punishment cell we have built around our minds and the first few steps back towards light and air.\"\u00a0\u2013Timothy Snyder, Author of  On Tyranny  and Professor of History, Yale University \u201cA seminal, ground-breaking, documented and honest examination of two of the central dilemmas of our time\u2014what is truth and where to find it.\u201d\u00a0\u2014Bob Woodward,\u00a0associate editor at  The Washington Post   As the cofounder of NewsGuard, a company that tracks\u00a0online misinformation, Steven Brill has observed the rise of fake news from a front-row seat.

None of this\u2014conspiracy theories embraced, expertise ridiculed, empirical evidence ignored\u2014has happened by accident. Brill takes us inside the decisions made by executives in Silicon Valley to code the algorithms embedded in their social media platforms to\u00a0maximize profits by pushing divisive content. He unravels the ingenious creation of automated advertising buying systems that reward that click-baiting content and\u00a0penalize reliable news publishers, and describes how the use of these\u00a0ad-financed,\u00a0misinformation platforms\u00a0by politicians, hucksters, and conspiracy theorists deceives\u00a0ordinary\u00a0citizens.\u00a0He documents\u00a0how the most powerful adversaries of America have used American-made social media and advertising tools against us with massive disinformation campaigns\u2014and\u00a0how, with the development of\u00a0generative artificial intelligence, everything could get exponentially worse unless\u00a0we act. The stakes are high for all of us, including Brill himself, whose company's role in exposing Russian disinformation operations resulted in a Russian agent targeting him and his family.

In Barefoot Biodynamics, organic grower Jeff Poppen\u2014\"The Barefoot Farmer\"\u2014combines tales from his personal history in rural Tennessee with the practical applications of biodynamic principles and the deep aspects of the biodynamic methods that continue to make his farm a success today.       Jeff's friendly, direct, and humorous writing will appeal not only to the biodynamic-curious, but also to farmers and gardeners who have experimented with the biodynamic approach and are looking for a deeper understanding of the practice.       Rooted in the teachings of biodynamic pioneer Rudolf Steiner, Jeff's unique insights and deep reflections on \"guiding lines\" of biodynamic growing are an invaluable resource. Those \"guiding lines\" include:       producing a farm's fertility using cover crops, compost, and other on-farm inputs   enjoying the renewing power of farm festivals   augmenting scientific knowledge with the power of observation and intuition   avoiding chemical fertilizers   understanding that carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen make up 95 percent of the physical structure of plants and are freely available in the air around us   enhancing the availability of critical minerals such as silica and lime through good farming practices   building humus-rich soil teeming with microbial life   using homeopathic preparations to heal and enrich the soil       In addition, Jeff walks the reader through the eight lectures on farming given by Steiner in 1924, summarizing important points from each lecture and \"translating\" them from Steiner's profound yet sometimes impenetrable vocabulary into plain language. In Barefoot Biodynamics, Jeff provides new insight into these enigmatic lectures, revealing an often overlooked yet cost-effective farming method rooted in common sense. "

                "In this joyous journey around the wild edges of Britain, Christopher Hart takes us through the life, ecology and history of the humble British hedge, showing us how this much-loved (but somewhat overlooked) feature is inextricably woven into our language, history and culture.  Hedges \u2013 or hedgerows \u2013 have long been an integral part of the British landscape; a bastion of privacy for our gardens, a protective presence on winding country lanes and a vital hiding place for birds and beasts on farmland. This man-made marvel is finally getting its time in the sun. Recognised as an environmental hero and a powerful climate ally, hedgerow is now considered the greatest edge habitat on earth, offering thorny scrub, mature woodland, grassland and even wetland. It plays a critical role in carbon sequestration and provides essential protection against the elements.  Hedgelands \u00a0highlights the hawthorn and hazel of ancient hedges; the abundance of wildlife, from the elusive dunnock to the striking nightingale, the industrious hedgehog to the little harvest mouse; and the free pickings that the hedgerow offers, making it an essential \u2013 and delicious \u2013 element of any countryside ramble.  Hedgelands \u00a0will tell you everything you never thought you needed to know about this wild, diverse and rich habitat \u2013 and you might even look at your humble hedge in a whole new way. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin. A reassuring and thought-provoking guide to all the big questions about AI and ethics    Should robots ever be considered free? Will computers transcend human intelligence? And what can we do to make sure AI is safe?  The artificial intelligence revolution has begun. Today, there are self-driving cars on our streets, autonomous weapons in our armies, robot surgeons in our hospitals - and AI's presence in our lives will only increase. Some see this as the dawn of new era in innovation and ease; others are alarmed by its destructive potential. But one thing is clear: this is a technology like no other, one that raises profound questions about freedom, justice and the very definition of human agency. In  Moral AI , world-renowned researchers in artificial intelligence and philosophy, Jana Schaich Borg, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Vince Conitzer tackle these thorny issues head-on. Writing lucidly and calmly, they lay out the recent advances in this still nascent field, peeling away the exaggeration and alarm, and offer clear examinations of the moral concerns at the heart of AI programmes. Ultimately, they argue that artificial intelligence can be built and used safely and ethically, but that its potential cannot be achieved without careful reflection on the values we wish to imbue it with. This is an essential primer for any thinking person. \u00a92024 Jana Schaich Borg, Vincent Conitzer, and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong (P)2024 Penguin Audio. "

Counterinsurgency, guerrilla warfare, terrorism, peace enforcement, policing. All these forms, like conventional warfare, are as old as mankind. Modern militaries claim to be professional bodies, responsible for the education, control, and discipline of their members. But at least one aspect of this claim is poorly executed: tactics are not taught to junior leaders, which is why this guide is essential for all junior leaders, officers, and NCOs alike. There is a military adage that there is no teacher like the enemy. True; but the wise commander prepares to meet that enemy and become their teacher instead. This is your essential study guide. "

In  Over the Influence , communication professor and CNN Opinion contributor Kara Alaimo reveals how social media is affecting every aspect of the lives of women and girls\u2014from our relationships and our parenting to our physical and mental well-being.  Over the Influence  is an audiobook about what it means to live in the world social media has wrought\u2014whether you\u2019re constantly connected or have deleted your accounts forever. Alaimo shows why you\u2019re likely to get fewer followers if you\u2019re a woman. She explains how fake news is crafted to prey on women\u2019s vulnerabilities. She reveals why so much of the content we find in our feeds is specifically designed to hold us back. And she explains how social media has made the offline world an uglier place for women. But we can change this. Alaimo offers up brilliant advice for how to get over the influence\u2014how to handle our daughters\u2019 use of social media, use dating apps to find the partners we\u2019re looking for, use social networks to bolster our careers, and protect ourselves from sextortionists, catfishers, and trolls. She also explains what we need to demand from lawmakers and tech companies.  Over the Influence  calls on women to recognize and call out the subtle (and not-so-subtle) sexism and misogyny we find online, reject misinformation that is targeted to us because of our gender, and use our platforms to empower ourselves and other women.

                "A show about how to kick ass at work without losing your humanityThe Radical Candor\u00ae approach\u2014Caring Personally while Challenging Directly\u2014can move you from a command-and-control culture to one of collaboration. Developed by Kim Scott, Radically Candid guidance is feedback that's both kind and clear, specific and sincere.  The Radical Candor Get Stuff Done Wheel: Guide Your Team To Achieve ResultsThe Get Stuff Done Wheel has 7 steps: Listen, Clarify, Debate, Decide, Persuade, Implement, and Learn. When run effectively, the GSD Wheel will enable your team to achieve more collectively than anyone could ever dream of achieving individually.  Listen: Your team should know what the company is trying to achieve, and they likely have some of the best ideas for what your team should be achieving. First, listen to their ideas in trying to figure out which goals your team should be pursuing. If you can build a culture where people listen to one another, they will start to fix things you as the boss never even knew were broken.  Clarify: Remember that new ideas are fragile and therefore easily squished. A critical role a manager can play is to augment the voice of their team by helping the team clarify their ideas and by clarifying the manager's understanding of the ideas.  Debate: Allowing the team time and space to publicly debate the ideas is a critical step. Guidelines for good debate include making the discussion about the ideas and not about egos. It's about finding the best answer together, not about who won the debate.  Decide: The best bosses often do not decide themselves, but rather create a clear decision-making process that empowers people closest to the facts to make as many decisions as possible. Not only does that result in better decisions, but it also results in better morale.  Persuade: This isn't easy, and it's vital to get it right. Persuasion at this stage can feel unnecessary and make the decider resentful of people on the team who aren't fully in agreement. The decider has painstakingly gone through the listen, clarify, and debate steps and made a decision. Why doesn't everyone else get why it's obvious we should do this\u2014or at least be willing to fall in line? But expecting others to implement a decision without being persuaded that it's the right thing to do is a recipe for terrible results. And don't imagine that you can step in and simply tell everyone to get in line behind a decision, whether you have made it or somebody else has.  Implement: As the boss, part of your job is to take a lot of the \"collaboration tax\" on yourself so that your team can spend more time implementing. The responsibilities you have as a boss take up a tremendous amount of time. One of the hardest things about being a boss is balancing these responsibilities with the work you need to do personally in your area of expertise. Here are the four things I've learned about getting this balance right: Don't waste your team's time; keep the \"dirt under your fingernails;\" block time to implement and fight meeting proliferation.  Learn: By the time you've reached Learn\u2014the last spot on the Get Sh*t Done Wheel\u2014you and your team have put in a ton of work, you've achieved something, and you want it to be great. And it is human nature for us to become attached\u2014often unreasonably attached\u2014to projects we've invested a lot of time and energy into. It can take almost superhuman discipline to step back, acknowledge when our results could be a lot better or are simply no good, and learn from the experience. "

Here\u2019s how we can seize back control of our lives from the corporate algorithms and create a better internet\u2014before it\u2019s too late.   \u201cIn the spirit of Thomas Paine\u2019s Revolution-era  Common Sense , this manifesto challenges us to create new digital architectures to safeguard democracy.\u201d\u2014Walter Isaacson, #1  New York Times  bestselling author of  Elon Musk   It was once a utopian dream. But today\u2019s internet, despite its conveniences and connectivity, is the primary cause of a pervasive unease that has taken hold in the U.S. and other democratic societies. It\u2019s why youth suicide rates are rising, why politics has become toxic, and why our most important institutions are faltering. \u00a0 Information is the lifeblood of any society, and our current system for distributing it is corrupted at its heart. Everything comes down to our ability to communicate openly and trustfully with each other. But, thanks to the dominant digital platforms and the ways they distort human behavior, we have lost that ability\u2014while, at the same time, we\u2019ve been robbed of the data that is rightfully ours. The roots of this crisis, argue Frank McCourt and Michael Casey, lie in the prevailing order of the internet. In plain but forceful language,\u00a0the authors\u2014a civic entrepreneur and an acclaimed journalist\u2014show how a centralized system controlled by a small group of for-profit entities has set this catastrophe in motion and eroded our personhood. \u00a0 And then they describe a groundbreaking solution to reclaim it: rather than superficial, patchwork regulations, we must reimagine the very architecture of the internet. The resulting \u201cthird-generation internet\u201d would replace the status quo with a new model marked by digital property rights, autonomy, and ownership. Inspired by historical calls to action like Thomas Paine\u2019s  Common Sense ,  Our Biggest Fight  argues that we must act now to embed the core values of a free, democratic society in the internet of tomorrow. Do it right and we will finally, properly, unlock its immense potential. "

Understanding the deep uncertainty surrounding the climate change problem helps us to better assess the risks. This book shows how uncertainty and disagreement can be part of the decision-making process. It provides a road map for formulating pragmatic solutions. Climate Uncertainty and Risk is a must-listen for those concerned about the environment, professionals dealing with climate change, and our national leaders. "

In this indispensable follow up to his acclaimed  The End of the Line: How Overfishing is Changing the World,  Charles Clover chronicles how determined individuals are proving that the crisis in our oceans can be reversed, with benefits for both local communities and entire ecosystems.  Rewilding the Sea  celebrates what happens when we step aside and let nature repair the damage: whether it is the overfishing of bluefin tuna across the Atlantic, the destruction of coral gardens by dredgers in Lyme Bay or the restoration of oysters on the East Coast of America. The latest scientific research shows that trawling and dredging create more CO2 than the aviation industry and damage vast areas of our continental shelves, stopping them soaking up carbon. We need to fish in different ways, where we fish at all. We can store carbon and have more fish by stepping aside more often and trusting nature. Essential and revelatory,  Rewilding the Sea  propels us to rethink our relationship with nature and reveals that saving our oceans is easier than we think.

Over the last decade, blockchains and crypto have opened up a new terrain for political action. It is not surprising, however, that the crypto space has also become overrun by unscrupulous marketing, theft, and scams. The problem is real, but it isn't a new one. Capitalism has ruined crypto, but that shouldn't be the end of it. Blockchain Radicals shows us how this has happened, and how to fix crypto in a way that is understandable for those who have never owned a cryptocurrency as well as those who are building their own decentralized applications. Covering everything from how Bitcoin saved WikiLeaks to decentralized finance, worker cooperatives, the environmental impact of Bitcoin and NFTs, and the crypto commons, it shows how these new tools can be used to challenge capitalism and build a better world for all of us. While crypto is often thought of as being synonymous with unbridled capitalism, Blockchain Radicals shows how the technology can be used for more radical purposes, beyond individual profit and towards collective autonomy.

In this provocative reflection on the shared pasts of literature and computer science, former Microsoft engineer and professor of comparative literature Dennis Yi Tenen provides crucial context for recent developments in AI, which holds important lessons for the future of humans living with smart technology. Intelligence expressed through technology should not be mistaken for a magical genie, capable of self-directed thought or action. Rather, in highly original and effervescent prose with a generous dose of wit, Yi Tenen asks us to read past the artifice-to better perceive the mechanics of collaborative work. Something as simple as a spell-checker or a grammar-correction tool, embedded in every word-processor, represents the culmination of a shared human effort, spanning centuries. With its masterful blend of history, technology, and philosophy, Yi Tenen's work ultimately urges us to view AI as a matter of labor history, celebrating the long-standing cooperation between authors and engineers.

Here was a tough leader who could grab back power from Twitter\u2019s entitled workforce, motivate them to get \u201cextremely hardcore,\u201d and supercharge Twitter\u2019s profit and potential. And it was all out of the goodness of his own heart, rooted in his fervent belief in the necessity of making Twitter friendlier to free speech. \"I didn\u2019t do it to make more money,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI did it to try and help humanity, whom I love.\u201d\u202f\u00a0 Once Musk charged into the Twitter headquarters, the command-and-control playbook Musk honed at Tesla and SpaceX went off the rails immediately. Distilling hundreds of hours of interviews with more than sixty employees, thousands of pages of internal documents, Slack messages, presentations, as well as court filings and congressional testimony,  Extremely Hardcore  is the true story of how Musk reshaped the world\u2019s online public square into his own personal megaphone.\u00a0\u00a0 You\u2019ll hear from employees who witnessed the destruction of their workplace in real-time, seeing years of progress to fight disinformation and hate speech wiped out within a matter of months. There\u2019s the machine-learning savant who went all-in on Twitter 2.0 before getting betrayed by his new CEO, the father whose need for healthcare swept him into Musk\u2019s inner circle, the trust and safety expert who became the subject of a harassment campaign his former boss incited, and the many other employees who tried to save the company from their new boss\u2019s worst instincts. This is the story of Twitter, but it\u2019s also a chronicle of the post-pandemic labor movement, a war between executives and a workforce newly awakened to their rights and needs.\u00a0 Riveting, character-driven, and filled with jaw-dropping revelations,  Extremely Hardcore  is the definitive, fly-on-the-wall story of how Elon Musk lit $44 billion on fire and burned down Twitter. It\u2019s the next best thing to being there, and you won\u2019t have to sleep in the Twitter office to get the scoop. "

He takes to task the perception of urban youth of color as unteachable, and he challenges educators to embrace and respect each student\u2019s culture and to reimagine the classroom as a site where roles are reversed and students become the experts in their own learning.  Putting forth his theory of Reality Pedagogy, Emdin provides practical tools to unleash the brilliance and eagerness of youth and educators alike\u2014both of whom have been typecast and stymied by outdated modes of thinking about urban education. With this fresh and engaging new pedagogical vision, Emdin demonstrates the importance of creating a family structure and building communities within the classroom, using culturally relevant strategies like hip-hop music and call-and-response, and connecting the experiences of urban youth to indigenous populations globally. Merging real stories with theory, research, and practice, Emdin demonstrates how by implementing the \u201cSeven Cs\u201d of reality pedagogy in their own classrooms, urban youth of color benefit from truly transformative education.

                "Instant  New York Times  Bestseller     From award-winning journalist Kara Swisher comes a witty, scathing, but fair accounting of the tech industry and its founders who wanted to change the world but broke it instead.     \"Swisher, the bad-ass journalist and OG chronicler of Silicon Valley...takes no prisoners in this highly readable look at the evolution of the digital world...Bawdy, brash, and compulsively thought-provoking, just like its author,    Burn Book    sizzles\" ( Booklist , starred review).  Part memoir, part history,  Burn Book  is a necessary chronicle of tech's most powerful players. From \"the queen of all media\" (Walt Mossberg,  The   Wall Street Journal ), this is the inside story we've all been waiting for about modern Silicon Valley and the biggest boom in wealth creation in the history of the world.   When tech titans crowed that they would \"move fast and break things,\" Kara Swisher was moving faster and breaking news. While covering the explosion of the digital sector in the early 1990s, she developed a long track record of digging up and reporting the facts about this new world order. Her consistent scoops drove one CEO to accuse her of \"listening in the heating ducts\" and prompted Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg to once observe: \"It is a constant joke in the Valley when people write memos for them to say, 'I hope Kara never sees this.'\"    While still in college, Swisher got her start at  The   Washington Post , where she became one of the few people in journalism interested in covering the nascent Internet. She went on to work for  The   Wall   Street Journal , joining with Walt Mossberg to start the groundbreaking  D: All Things Digital  conference, as well as pioneering tech news sites.   Swisher has interviewed everyone who matters in tech over three decades, right when they presided over an explosion of world-changing innovation that has both helped and hurt our world. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Bob Iger, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Meg Whitman, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg are just a few whom Swisher made sweat\u2014figuratively and, in Zuckerberg's case, literally.   Despite the damage she chronicles, Swisher remains optimistic about tech's potential to help solve problems and not just create them. She calls upon the industry to make better, more thoughtful choices, even as a new set of powerful AI tools are poised to change the world yet again. At its heart, this book is a love story to, for, and about tech from someone who knows it better than anyone. "

In The Security Culture Playbook, Perry Carpenter and Kai Roer deliver experience-driven, actionable insights into how to transform your organization's security culture and reduce human risk at every level.

The book offers: an expose of what security culture really is and how it can be measured; a careful exploration of the seven dimensions that comprise security culture; practical tools for managing your security culture program, such as the Security Culture Framework and the Security Culture Maturity Model; and insights into building support within the executive team and Board of Directors for your culture management program. Also including several revealing interviews from security culture thought leaders in a variety of industries, The Security Culture Playbook is an essential resource for cybersecurity professionals, risk and compliance managers, executives, board members, and other business leaders seeking to proactively manage and reduce risk.

                "In Step into the Metaverse, Dr. Mark van Rijmenam delivers a startlingly insightful discussion about how the world as we know it will fundamentally change as the physical and the digital worlds merge into the metaverse, impacting the everyday experiences of people, companies, and societies. The author maps out the extraordinary opportunities and challenges facing business leaders, consumers, regulators, policymakers, and other metaverse stakeholders trying to navigate the future of the Internet. In the metaverse, you can be who you want to be, where you want to be, and companies and consumers are only restricted by their own creativity how they can benefit from the immersive internet. With engaging commentary on issues ranging from avatars, identity, and digital fashion to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain, and the economics of the metaverse, this book also offers: discussions on the importance of an open and interoperable metaverse build on the web 3.0 paradigm if we want to reign in the control of Big Tech over our identity, data, and lives; explorations of the enormous-and largely untapped-potential for metaverse entertainment; and considerations related to the dangers of an always-on, immersive internet, including data breaches, avatar imposters, mental health issues, corporate and state surveillance, and the need for metaverse law.

                "Apple Books: Most Anticipated Books of Summer 2022 Amazon: Editors' Choice in Nonfiction Fast Company: Selected Among 11 Best Technology Books of Summer 2022 Tim Sweeney (CEO of Fortnite-maker Epic Games): \"Matthew Ball's essays have defined, analyzed, and inspired the Metaverse for years. His book is an approachable and essential guide to the strategic, technical, and philosophical foundations of this new medium.\" \"This book feels like a rare achievement?a definitive statement about an emerging phenomenon that could shape the digital world, the global economy, and the very experience of human consciousness.\" ?Derek Thompson, Atlantic staff writer and national best-selling author of Hit Makers From the leading theorist of the Metaverse comes the definitive account of the next internet: what the Metaverse is, what it will take to build it, and what it means for all of us. The term \"Metaverse\" is suddenly everywhere, from the front pages of national newspapers and the latest fashion trends to the plans of the most powerful companies in history. It is already shaping the policy platforms of the US government, the European Union, and the Chinese Communist Party. But what, exactly, is the Metaverse? As pioneering theorist and venture capitalist Matthew Ball explains, it is a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences, and also underpin much of the physical world. For decades, these ideas have been limited to science fiction and video games, but they are now poised to revolutionize every industry and function, from finance and healthcare to education, consumer products, city planning, dating, and well beyond. Taking us on an expansive tour of the \"next internet,\" Ball demonstrates that many proto-Metaverses are already here, such as Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox. Yet these offer only a glimpse of what is to come. Ball presents a comprehensive definition of the Metaverse before explaining the technologies that will power it?and the breakthroughs that will be necessary to fully realize it. He addresses the governance challenges the Metaverse entails; investigates the role of Web3, blockchains, and NFTs; and predicts Metaverse winners and losers. Most importantly, he examines many of the Metaverse's almost unlimited applications. The internet will no longer be at arm's length; instead, it will surround us, with much of our lives, labor, and leisure taking place inside the Metaverse. Bringing clarity and authority to a frequently misunderstood concept, Ball foresees trillions of dollars in new value?and the radical reshaping of society. "

                "In Draining New Orleans, renowned geographer Richard Campanella recounts the epic challenges and ingenious efforts to dewater the Crescent City. With forays into geography, public health, engineering, architecture, politics, sociology, race relations, and disaster response, he chronicles the herculean attempts to \"reclaim\" the city's swamps and marshes and install subsurface drainage for massive urban expansion. The study begins with a vivid description of a festive event on Mardi Gras weekend 1915, which attracted an entourage of elite New Orleanians to the edge of Bayou Barataria to witness the christening of giant water pumps. What transpired in the years and decades that followed can only be understood by examining the large swath of history dating back two centuries earlier and extending through the colonial, antebellum, postbellum, and Progressive eras to modern times. The consequences of dewatering New Orleans proved both triumphant and tragic. The city's engineering prowess transformed it into a world leader in drainage technology, yet the municipality also fell victim to its own success. Campanella emphasizes the role of determined and sometimes unsavory individuals who spearheaded projects to separate water from dirt, creating lucrative opportunities in the process not only for the community but also for themselves.

Hilke Schellmann, is an Emmy\u2011award winning investigative reporter,  Wall Street Journal and Guardian contributor  and Journalism Professor at NYU. In  The Algorithm , she investigates the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world of work. AI is now being used to decide who has access to an education, who gets hired, who gets fired, and who receives a promotion. Drawing on exclusive information from whistleblowers, internal documents and real\u2011world tests, Schellmann discovers that many of the algorithms making high\u2011stakes decisions are biased, racist, and do more harm than good. Algorithms are on the brink of dominating our lives and threaten our human future\u2014if we don't fight back.     Schellmann takes readers on a journalistic detective story testing algorithms that have secretly analyzed job candidates' facial expressions and tone of voice. She investigates algorithms that scan our online activity including Twitter and LinkedIn to construct personality profiles \u00e0 la Cambridge Analytica. Her reporting reveals how employers track the location of their employees, the keystrokes they make, access everything on their screens and, during meetings, analyze group discussions to diagnose problems in a team. Even universities are now using predictive analytics for admission offers and financial aid. "

Through original research and industry experience, Kominers and Kaczynski describe the possibilities of this new digital frontier with clarity and rigor.

                "A bestselling author and AI team up to write a novel. Chaos ensues. AI is changing the world at frightening speed. A bestselling author decides to find out more... Is ChatGPT the end of creative industries as we know them? An ethical quagmire from which there is no return? A threat to all our jobs, as we keep hearing on the news? Bestselling children's author Andy Stanton has made a career out of writing differently \u2013 from the unconventional 'hero' of his bestselling Mr Gum series to his penchant for absurdist plots, his children's books are anything but formulaic. When a friend introduces him to ChatGPT, the new large language chatbot, Andy is as sceptical as he is curious. Can this jumble of algorithms really mimic the spontaneity of human thought? Could it one day replace human authors like him for good? And are we soon to be ruled over by despotic robot overlords. He decides there's only one thing for it \u2013 he must test this bot's capabilities. Eventually, he settles on a prompt that will push the algorithm to its creative limits: 'tell me a story about a blue whale with a tiny penis.' Chaos ensues. What follows is a surprising and illuminating battle between Andy and ChatGPT that maybe, just maybe, might help us all understand AI a little bit better. Join Andy and his beleaguered AI lackey on a rollicking metafictional journey through the art of storytelling. Presenting his prompts and the AI-generated narrative alongside extensive commentary, Stanton provides a startling paean to the art of a good story and boundless human creativity. Hopeful and hilarious, Benny the Blue Whale provides a joyfully anarchic meditation on AI, literature and why we write. "

With three hundred hives, Hubbell stays busy year-round tending to the bees and harvesting their honey, a process that is as personally demanding as it is rewarding. Exploring the progression of both the author and the hive through the seasons, this is \"a book about bees to be sure, but it is also about other things: the important difference between loneliness and solitude; the seasonal rhythms inherent in rural living; the achievement of independence; the accommodating of oneself to nature\" (Philadelphia Inquirer). Beautifully written and full of exquisitely rendered details, it is a tribute to Hubbell's wild hilltop in the Ozarks and of the joys of living a complex life in a simple place. "

Targets are set, governments vow to do their bit and on a societal level we are encouraged to do ours by choosing to forego all things plastic. The question is whether this is the right decision or are we inadvertently at risk of doing more harm than good? Are there other factors in play needing equal consideration? The book will follow the story of plastic, and to an extent rubber (known collectively as polymers), and all with an eye to the overarching theme of the environment. It will ask some challenging questions but also sets out to inform. It begins by building a picture. Just what exactly is a plastic, how did it gain such a dominant role in our lives? Are recent denouncements fully justified? By better understanding plastics, a clearer opinion can be formed of their usefulness and their potential to alleviate serious environmental concerns. "
