                "Are you ready to reconnect with family in a meaningful way, but unsure where or how to begin?     This beloved classic poignantly explains how constructing the genogram, or a basic family tree, can help us to better understand and mend family relationships and dynamics. Readers learn how genograms can reveal a family's history of estrangement, alliance, divorce, or suicide, exposing intergenerational patterns that prove more than coincidental. The book sheds light on a range of complex issues such as birth order and sibling rivalry, family myths and secrets, cultural differences, couple relationships, and the pivotal role of loss.    In the third edition of this revelatory book, \"godmother of genograms\" Monica McGoldrick and family therapist Tracey Laszloffy focus on aiding readers in their own work to understand their family history and change their role in relationships where there is distance, conflict, or cutoff. Readers will also find new and updated material on the intergenerational transmission of trauma, the ramifications of uncovering family secrets via DNA testing, and more. If you've ever struggled to understand the complex dynamics of your family\u2014and your place within it\u2014this book is for you. "

She did not expect that her father, Nick, would choose not to open it. A few years later, she and her brother finally did. Nick, an absent father, was a would-be writer and back-to-the-lander who lived off the grid in Northern California. Nick\u2019s own father, Gawen\u2014also absent\u2014had been a wellborn Englishman who wrote a Bloomsbury-like novel about lesbian lovers, before moving to Kenya and ultimately dying a mysterious death at age twenty-seven. Brownrigg was told Gawen had likely died by suicide. Reconstructing Gawen\u2019s short, colorful life from revelations in the package takes her through glamorous 1930s London and staid Pasadena, toward the last gasp of the British Empire in Kenya, and from there, deep into the California redwoods, where Nick later carved out a rugged path in the wilderness, keeping his English past at bay. Vividly weaving together the lives of her father and grandfather, through memory and imagination, Brownrigg explores issues of sexuality and silences, and childhoods fractured by divorce. In her uncovering of this lost family, she writes movingly of daughterhood and of parenthood, gradually making her own story whole. "

In Mother Island, Figueroa traces her search for identity as shaped by and against a mother who settled into the safety of assimilation.\u00a0In lyrical, blistering prose,\u00a0Figueroa\u00a0recalls a childhood in Ohio\u00a0in which\u00a0she was relegated\u00a0to the background of her mother\u2019s string of failed marriages; her own marriage in her early twenties to a man twice her age; how her work as a licensed massage therapist helped her heal her body trauma; and how\u00a0becoming a mother has reshaped her relationship to her family and herself. Only\u00a0as\u00a0an adult in New Mexico was Figueroa able to forge her own path, using writing to recast her origin story.\u00a0In a journey that takes her to Puerto Rico and back, Figueroa looks to her ancestors to reimagine her relationship to the past and to her mother\u2019s native island,\u00a0reaching beyond her own mother into a greater experience of mothering and claiming herself.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drawing from Puerto Rican folklore and mythology, a literary lineage of women writers\u00a0of color, and narratives of identity, Figueroa presents a cultural coming-of-age story. Candid and raw, Mother Island gets to the heart of the question: Who do we become when we are no longer trying to be someone else?. "

One story in particular captures his attention: that of his great-grandfather, a Syrian-born, Arabic-speaking Jewish immigrant to Argentina who in the 1920s worked as a traveling salesman in the Andes\u2014and may have left behind forgotten descendants along the way. Encouraged by his grandfather, Jordan goes in search of these \u201cLost Salamas,\u201d traveling more than a thousand miles up the spine of South America\u2019s greatest mountain range. Combining travelog, history, memoir, and reportage,  Stranger in the Desert  transports readers from the lonely plains of Patagonia to the breathtaking altiplano of the high Andes; from the old Jewish quarter of Damascus to today\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. It is also a fervent journey of self-discovery as Salama grapples with his own Jewish, Arab, and Latin American identities, interrogating the stories families tell themselves, and to what end. "

                "On his deathbed, Dr. Joanne Intrator's father poses two unsettling questions:   \"Are you tough enough? Do they know who you are?\"  Joanne soon realizes that these haunting questions relate to a center-city Berlin building at 16 Wallstrasse that the Nazis ripped away from her family in 1938. But a decade is to pass before she will fully come to grasp why her father threw down the gauntlet as he did.  Repeatedly, Joanne's restitution quest brings her into confrontation with yet another of her profound fears surrounding Germany and the Holocaust. Having to call on reserves of strength she's unsure she possesses, the author leans into her professional command of psychiatry, often overcoming flabbergasting obstacles perniciously dumped in her path.  The depth and lucidity of psychological insight threaded throughout Summons to Berlin makes it an attention-grabbing standout among books on like topics. As a reader, you'll come away delighted to know just who Dr. Joanne Intrator is. You'll also finish the book cheering for her, because in the end, she proves far more than tough enough to satisfy her father's unnerving final demands. "

                "Birth, marriage and death records are an essential resource for family historians, and this handbook is an authoritative introduction to them. It explains the original motives for registering these milestones in individual lives, describes how these record-keeping systems evolved, and shows how they can be explored and interpreted. Authors David Annal and Audrey Collins guide researchers through the difficulties they may encounter in understanding the documentation. They recount the history of parish registers from their origin in Tudor times, they look at how civil registration was organized in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and explain how the system in England and Wales differs from those in Scotland and Ireland. The record-keeping practiced by nonconformist and foreign churches, in communities overseas and in the military is also explained, as are the systems of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Other useful sources of evidence for births, marriages and deaths are explored and, of course, the authors assess the online sites that researchers can turn to for help in this crucial area of family history research.

Nick's only connection to his ancestor is his great grandmother Agnes' patchy memories, and a mysterious old manuscript written in French. "
