'Your friends would probably describe me as nice. But guess what? I can't stand your friends. I'm a liar. I'm a thief. I'm highly manipulative. I don't care what other people think. I'm capable of almost anything.'   Ever since she was a small child, Patric Gagne knew she was different. Although she felt intense love for her family and her best friend, David, these connections were never enough to make her be 'good', or to reduce her feelings of apathy and frustration. As she grew older, her behaviour escalated from petty theft through to breaking and entering, stalking, and worse . . . As an adult, Patric realized that she was a sociopath. Although she instantly connected with the official descriptions of sociopathy, she also knew they didn't tell the full story: she had a plan for her life, had nurtured close relationships and was doing her best (most of the time) to avoid harming others. While her darker impulses warred against her attempts to live a settled, loving life with her partner, Patric began to wonder - was there a way for sociopaths to integrate happily into society? And could she find it before her own behaviour went a step too far?  'She is compelling, like a movie character \u2013 a sociopath who's beautiful, warm and funny, articulate and charming' -  The Guardian  'A heart-rending account of a lonely child growing up into a lonely adult, misunderstood and unable to connect with people '  -  iNews.

'A comprehensive toolkit for anyone looking to elevate their communication and improve themselves' \u2013 Matt Abrahams, author of  Think Faster, Talk Smarter   We have hundreds of conversations every week, offline, online and even in our heads. But have you ever stopped to think about  the words you use ? The way we describe ourselves and the world around us shapes our decisions, emotions and actions. Mariano Sigman, the world-leading neuroscientist and bestselling author, shows that conversation is one of the most important tools for positive change, better relationships and improved critical thinking. Drawing on extensive research, he demonstrates that our minds are much more malleable than we think, and even the smallest shifts in our language can transform our habits and our perceptions. By understanding this, we can break free from patterns of limiting beliefs and tackle the disinformation we all face daily. Offering practical guidance based on the latest psychology and neuroscience, this witty and intelligent book urges us to be open to the possibility of our own fallibility. By embracing conversations as a tool for growth, we can learn to communicate better with others and, most crucially, ourselves, giving us a more rewarding and successful life.  'Bursting with absorbing ideas and practical guidance. A must-read for anyone keen to understand the profound impact of language on ourselves and society' \u2013 Erica Dhawan, author of  Digital Body Language. "

                "'Absorbing' -  Guardian  'Arnold-Forster is a shrewd critic and delightful guide . . . She carries weighty learning lightly \u2013 embracing everything relevant, from dubious neuroscience to cod sociology.' -  The Telegraph   In  Nostalgia: A History of a Dangerous Emotion , Agnes Arnold-Forster blends neuroscience and psychology with the history of medicine and emotions to explore the evolution of nostalgia from its first identification in seventeenth-century Switzerland (when it was held to be an illness that could, quite literally, kill you) to the present day (when it is co-opted by advertising agencies and politicians alike to sell us goods and policies). Nostalgia is a social and political emotion, vulnerable to misuse, and one that reflects the anxieties of the age. It is one of the many ways we communicate a desire for the past, dissatisfaction with the present and our visions for the future. Arnold-Forster's fascinating history of this complex, slippery emotion is a lens through which to consider the changing pace of society, our collective feelings of regret, dislocation and belonging, the conditions of modern and contemporary work, and the politics of fear and anxiety. It is also a clear-eyed analysis of what we are doing now, how we feel about it and what we might want to change about the world we live in.  'Arnold-Forster belongs to that valuable non-jargon-spouting breed of academic who is capable of explaining complex ideas in simple language.' -  The Times. "

This is the first model of coaching culture development that goes beyond the listing of stages and strategies in the academic literature based on pracademic experience. It is a dynamic, process model which informs practitioners of how to develop a coaching culture in organisations. Each stage is explained in terms of how coaching is conceptualised by organisational leaders, the motivation for introducing coaching into the organisation, the organisational members who are the recipients of coaching, and those who are involved in delivering the coaching at each stage. The model contributes to the academic literature and the growing calls for coaching to become a discipline in its own right. "

                "Cranes are enigmatic birds. Only very little is known about the behaviour of these graceful dancers. The renowned naturalist and crane expert Bernhard Wessling takes us on exciting and adventurous expeditions into their hidden world and gets to the bottom of the myths surrounding these birds of happiness. With the help of a specially developed bioacoustic method, Dr. Wessling studied Eurasian, Red-Crowned, Sandhill and Whooping Cranes, all in the wild. He has researched their intelligence, social dynamics and communication and engaged in their protection. Impressively illustrated and lively narrated, this book presents his findings on their individually unique lives and relationships, their ability to adapt and solve problems, and their emotions. His observations allow us to delve deeply into the cranes' way of life and consciousness, often demonstrating the surprising similarities between humans and animals. An amazing work about the spirit of discovery, humility and respect for nature in the tradition of Alexander von Humboldt.  Cranes are among the most captivating birds on this planet. Dr. Wessling knows these birds, has accumulated a lifetime of observations on them, and has thought deeply about their abilities. In this book, he seeks to overturn old ideas about how these birds live, communicate, and think. His revelations surprise and delight and shed new light on an ancient avian family. \u00a0 Jennifer Ackerman, author of the New York Times bestseller\u00a0 The Genius of Birds\u00a0 and \u00a0The Bird Way    The Call of the Cranes is a mesmerizing, vivid, lyrical and revelatory book. It truly is a spectacular book and a treasure! \u00a0\u00a0 Sy Montgomery, naturalist and author of 31 books (incl. the New York Times bestseller\u00a0 The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness )   In this book, Bernhard Wessling shares his fascinating stories about cranes through patient observations and thoughtful conclusions.\u00a0  George Archibald, Co-Founder of the International Crane Foundation, Senior Conservationist.

Interest in the brain bases of language goes back to the birth of the modern neurosciences in the late nineteenth century. Today, tools such as fMRI and EEG allow us to study brain activity non-invasively as people perform complex cognitive tasks like talking or reading. In this book, Jonathan Brennan shows how brain signals are connected with the intricate cognitive structures that underlie human language. Each chapter focuses on specific insights including the neural codes for speech perception, meaning, and sentence structure. The book also explores larger themes such as how to connect abstract notions like \"knowing a language\" to concrete signals that are measured in a laboratory, and how to reconcile apparently conflicting pieces of data that arise from different experiments. Written in an accessible, conversational style, and featuring a glossary of key terms, this slim guide will appeal to a wide range of readers interested in how the human brain allows us to use language.

                "This book\u00a0presents a journey into how language is put together for speaking and understanding and how it can come apart when there is injury to the brain. The goal is to provide a window into language and the brain through the lens of aphasia, a speech and language disorder resulting from brain injury in adults. This book answers the question of how the brain analyzes the pieces of language, its sounds, words, meaning, and ultimately puts them together into a unitary whole.\u00a0 While its major focus is on clinical, experimental, and theoretical approaches to language deficits in aphasia, it integrates this work with recent technological advances in neuroimaging to provide a state-of-the-art portrayal of language and brain function. It also shows how current computational models that share properties with those of neurons allow for a common framework to explain how the brain processes language and its parts and how it breaks down according to these principles. Consideration will also be given to whether language can recover after brain injury or when areas of the brain recruited for speaking, understanding, or reading are deprived of input, as seen with people who are deaf or blind. No prior knowledge of linguistics, psychology, computer science, or neuroscience is assumed. The informal style of this book makes it accessible to anyone with an interest in the complexity and beauty of language and who wants to understand how it is put together, how it comes apart, and how language maps on to the brain.

It's not just the noise in our ears, but also the noise on our screens and in our heads. 'Silence is golden,' the adage goes. But how do we find it in times like these? Justin Zorn and Leigh Marz take us on an unlikely journey exploring why silence is essential for physical health, mental clarity, professional fulfilment, nourishing relationships, ecological sustainability, and vibrant community. Drawing on lessons from neuroscience, philosophy, business, politics, activism, and the arts,  Golden  teaches us how to go beyond the ordinary rules and offers tools of mindfulness to help individuals, organisations and whole societies dial down the noise and reclaim pristine quiet. Quietly profound and constantly surprising,  Golden  is a field guide to finding silence. "

                "A forensic psychiatrist's second opinion on the conditions that led to Ernest Hemingway's suicide, \"mixing biography, literature and medical analysis\" ( The Washington Post ).   Hemingway's Brain  is an innovative biography and the first forensic psychiatric examination of Nobel Prize\u2013winning author Ernest Hemingway. After seventeen years researching Hemingway's life and medical history, Andrew Farah, a forensic psychiatrist, has concluded that the writer's diagnoses were incorrect. Contrary to the commonly accepted diagnoses of bipolar disorder and alcoholism, he provides a comprehensive explanation of the medical conditions that led to Hemingway's suicide. Hemingway received state-of-the-art psychiatric treatment at one of the nation's finest medical institutes, but according to Farah it was for the wrong illness, and his death was not the result of medical mismanagement but medical misunderstanding. Farah argues that despite popular mythology Hemingway was not manic-depressive and his alcohol abuse and characteristic narcissism were simply pieces of a much larger puzzle. Through a thorough examination of biographies, letters, memoirs of friends and family, and even Hemingway's FBI file, combined with recent insights on the effects of trauma on the brain, Farah pieces together this compelling alternative narrative of Hemingway's illness, one missing from the scholarship for too long. Though Hemingway's life has been researched extensively and many biographies written, those authors relied on the original diagnoses and turned to psychoanalysis and conjecture regarding Hemingway's mental state. Farah has sought to understand why Hemingway's decline accelerated after two courses of electroconvulsive therapy, and in this volume explains which current options might benefit a similar patient today.  Hemingway's Brain  provides a full and accurate accounting of this psychiatric diagnosis by exploring the genetic influences, traumatic brain injuries, and neurological and psychological forces that resulted in what many have described as his tortured final years. It aims to eliminate the confusion and define for all future scholarship the specifics of the mental illnesses that shaped legendary literary works and destroyed the life of a master. "

But do dogs also understand our emotions? Can they grasp cause and effect relationships? What fascinates us humans about dogs? Is it only the proverbial 'puppy dog eyes' that make dogs look sympathetic? Or is it the fact that these animals have grown very well-attuned to humans and are willing to cooperate with them?  In a total of ten chapters, Juliane Br\u00e4uer and Juliane Kaminski present the results of the most important scientific studies of the last twenty years on dog cognition. "

We are all marketers, whether you are a manager motivating your team, an employee making a big presentation, an activist staging a protest or a company executive selling the next big thing. In  For the Culture , Marcus Collins argues that the most powerful vehicle for influencing behaviour is true cultural engagement. To inspire communities, we first need to think hard about how we appeal to their values and what we will contribute to their culture. With a deep perspective based on a century's worth of data, Collins breaks down the many ways in which culture influences behaviour. Using captivating stories from his own life as a top marketer \u2013 including spearheading digital strategy for Beyonc\u00e9, working with iTunes and Nike+ on their collaboration, and designing ads for McDonalds \u2013 he shows readers how they can do the same. Full of memorable examples, from 1960s hippy culture to the enduring success of Patagonia,  For the Culture  offers the essential tools for creating lasting engagement and influence.  'Some people seem to intuitively 'get it.' Most do not. Collins articulates 'it' for the rest of us and provides not just an understanding, but a guide for how to actually engage and influence culture' \u2013 Steve Huffman, co-founder and CEO, Reddit. "

I learned a lot from this wonderful book' Rick Hanson  We've been told we need to master our emotions and think rationally to succeed. But cutting-edge science shows that feelings are every bit as important to our success as thinking. You make hundreds of decisions every day, from what to eat for breakfast to how to influence people, and not one of them could be made without the essential component of emotion. It has long been held that thinking and feeling are separate and opposing forces in our behaviour. But as best-selling author Leonard Mlodinow tells us, extraordinary advances in psychology and neuroscience have proven that emotions are as critical to our well-being as thinking. How can you connect better with others? How can you improve your relationship to frustration, fear, and anxiety? What can you do to live a happier life? The answers lie in understanding emotions. Taking us on a journey from the labs of pioneering scientists to real-world scenarios that have flirted with disaster, Mlodinow shows us how our emotions help, why they sometimes hurt, and what we can make of the difference. Cutting-edge research and deep insights into our evolution, biology, and neuroscience promise to help us understand our emotions better and maximize their benefits. Told with characteristic clarity and fascinating stories, Mlodinow's exploration of the new science of feelings is an essential guide to making the most of one of nature's greatest gifts to us. "

                "The acclaimed author of  An Unquiet Mind  considers the age-old quest for relief from psychological pain and the role of the exceptional healer in the journey back to health.  \u201cTo treat, even to cure, is not always to heal.\u201d In this expansive cultural history of the treatment and healing of mental suffering, Kay Jamison writes about psychotherapy, what makes a great healer, and the role of imagination and memory in regenerating the mind. From the trauma of the battlefields of the twentieth century, to those who are grieving, depressed, or with otherwise unquiet minds, to her own experience with bipolar illness, Jamison demonstrates how remarkable psychotherapy and other treatments can be when done well. She argues that not only patients but doctors must be healed. She draws on the example of W.H.R. Rivers, the renowned psychiatrist who treated poet Siegfried Sassoon and other World War I soldiers, and discusses the long history of physical treatments for mental illness, as well as the ancient and modern importance of religion, ritual, and myth in healing the mind. She looks at the vital role of artists and writers, as well as exemplary figures, such as Paul Robeson, who have helped to heal us as a people.  Fires in the Dark  is a beautiful meditation on the quest and adventure of healing the mind, on the power of accompaniment, and the necessity for knowledge. "

Part behavioural study, part entertainment, at its heart,  Fans  is a story of collectives, of what happens to us when we interact with people who share our passions. The human brain is wired to reach out, and while our groupish tendencies can bring much strife (religious intolerance, racism, war, etc.), they are also the source of some of our greatest satisfactions. Fandoms offer much of the pleasure of tribalism with little of the harm: a feeling of belonging and of shared culture, a sense of meaning and purpose, improved mental well-being, reassurance that our most outlandish convictions will be taken seriously, and the freedom to try to emulate (and dress like) our hero. In  Fans , Michael Bond explores the subject through the lens of social identity theory, a set of ideas used by social psychologists and anthropologists to understand how people behave in groups and why groups have such a profound effect on human culture.

This volume comprehensively examines the nature of psychosocial stress and the implications of different coping strategies for adaptation and health across the lifespan. Carolyn M. Aldwin synthesizes a vast body of knowledge within a conceptual framework that emphasizes the transactions between mind and body and between persons and environments. She analyzes different kinds of stressors and their psychological and physiological effects, both negative and positive. Ways in which coping is influenced by personality, relationships, situational factors, and culture are explored. The book also provides a methodological primer for stress and coping research, critically reviewing available measures and data analysis techniques. "

That's the easy bit. The harder part, and what this book is really about, is how to make your thinking original and effective. And here the problem is that too often we don't really engage the gears of our brain, don't really look at issues in an original or active way, we just respond. Like computers, inputs are processed according to established rules and outputs are thus largely predetermined. Yet that's not what makes us human and that's not where the big prizes in life are to be found.In the third millennium, we need to think a bit more\u2014not less! And so the focus in this book is on practical suggestions about ways to think better... on thinking strategies that each have their own style, applications and benefits. "

With the recent licensing of memantine, clinicians finally have a drug option that will delay disease progression.    Severe Dementia   is the first book to focus exclusively on severe dementia. It addresses both the clinical features of the disease and the social aspects of care. Introductory chapters on the differential diagnosis, neurochemistry and molecular pathology of severe dementia set the scene for the clinical discussion. Detailed clinical chapters on cognitive function, depression, physical effects, staging and function follow.\u00a0All therapeutic interventions are then discussed, including memantine, anticholinesterases, neuroleptics and non-pharmacological treatment. The final chapters review the social and economic aspects of dementia care, including family involvement, person-centered care, palliative care, ethics and health economics.   Written and edited by experts in geriatric psychiatry and geriatrics,   Severe Dementia   is of value to all clinicians involved in the management of this complex and vulnerable group of patients.\u00a0It is also of interest to general practitioners and carers in nursing homes.

After losing his dad to Covid-19, Dean Burnett found himself wondering what life would be like without them. And so, he decided to put his feelings under the microscope - for science. In  Emotional Ignorance , Dean takes us on an incredible journey of discovery, stretching from the origins of life to the end of the universe. Along the way he reveals: - why we would ever follow our gut; - whether things really were better in the old days; - why it's so hard to stop doomscrolling; - and how sad music can make us happier. Combining expert analysis, brilliant humour and powerful insights into the grieving process, Dean uncovers how, far from holding us back, our emotions make us who we are. "

And this is also the first time that a book has brought together the most important and transcendent (for its applicability to the advertising market) strategic advertising mechanisms.   The text explains from classic mechanisms such as Rosser Reeves's USP or Procter & Gamble's copy strategy to modern mechanisms such as Kevin Roberts's Lovemarks or Douglas Holt's iconic brands. It also considers European mechanisms such as Jacques S\u00e9gu\u00e9la's star strategy or Henri Joannis's psychological axis. The book has the most complete academic review.   Strategic Advertising Mechanisms: From Copy Strategy to Iconic Brands, integrates the most important strategic advertising mechanisms developed throughout the time: USP, brand image, positioning, Lovemarks... This is the first and only book to date that compiles the most consolidated methods by advertisers or advertising agencies (P&G, Bates, Ogilvy or Euro) in the history of modern advertising.   Primary readership will be among practitioners, researchers, scholars and students in a range of disciplines, including communication, advertising, business and economic, information and communication, sociology, psychology and humanities. There may also be appeal to the more general reader with an interest in how advertising strategic planning works. "

The racial fault lines of our country have been revealed in stark detail as our national news cycle is flooded with stories about the past. If you are just now learning about the massacre in Tulsa, the killing of Native American children in compulsory \"residential schools\" designed to destroy their culture, and the incarceration of Japanese Americans, you are not alone. The seeds of today's inequalities were sown in past events like these. The time to unlearn the whitewashed history we believed was true is now.    If we close our eyes to our history, we cannot make the systemic changes needed to mend our country. Today's challenges began centuries ago and have deepened and widened over time. To take the path to a more just future, we must not ignore the damage but see it through others' eyes, bear witness to it, and uncover its origins. As historians share these truths, we will need psychologists to help us navigate the shame, guilt, disbelief, and resistance many of us feel.    Dolly Chugh, award-winning professor of social psychology and author of the acclaimed  The Person You Mean to Be , gives us the psychological tools we need to grapple with the truth of our country. Through heartrending personal histories and practical advice, Chugh invites us to dismantle the systems built by our forbearers and work toward a more just future. "

In  Poles Apart,  an expert on polarisation, a behavioural scientist and a professional communicator explain why we are so prone to be drawn into rival, often deeply antagonistic factions. They explore the shaping force of our genetic make-up on our fundamental views and the nature of the influences that family, friends and peers exert. They pinpoint the economic and political triggers that tip people from healthy disagreement to dangerous hostility, and the part played by social media in spreading entrenched opinions. And they help us to understand why outlooks that can seem so bizarre and extreme to us seem so eminently sensible to those who hold them. Above all, they show what practical and effective steps we can all take to narrow divisions, build respect for others, and create a greater degree of common understanding. ____________________________________________________ '  Poles Apart    is an extraordinary achievement: fresh, deeply authoritative, and entertaining on every page.  Everyone talks about polarisation, but no one does it like Goldsworthy, Osborne, and Chesterfield.  You'll finish this book wiser, kinder, and more hopeful  than when you started it.'

Why do we over think when something bad happens to us? Renowned psychologist Professor Woo-kyoung Ahn devised a course at Yale called 'Thinking' to help students examine the biases that cause people so many problems in their daily lives. It quickly became one of the university's most popular courses. Now, for the first time, she presents key insights from her years of teaching and research. It's well known that our minds are tripped up by error, cognitive bias and prejudice. But knowing that isn't enough: the thinking problems still exist. In this clear guide, Professor Woo-kyoung Ahn gives clear and practical steps to actually change our thinking. The natural follow-up to Daniel Kahneman's  Thinking, Fast and Slow ,  Thinking 101  shows how we can improve not just our own daily lives through better awareness of our biases, but the lives of everyone around us. It is required reading for everyone who wants to think - and live - better. "

                "'Heady, exhilarating, often astonishing'  New York Times     'Iridescently original, deeply disorientating and yet somehow radically hopeful ... worth reading and rereading' Brian Eno   'Be prepared to re-evaluate your relationship with the amazing life forms with whom we share the planet. Fascinating, innovative and thought provoking: I thoroughly recommend  Ways of Being ' Dr Jane Goodall, DBE, Founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and UN Messenger of Peace   Recent years have seen rapid advances in 'artificial' intelligence, which increasingly appears to be something stranger than we ever imagined. At the same time, we are becoming more aware of the other intelligences which have been with us all along, unrecognized. These other beings are the animals, plants, and natural systems that surround us, and are slowly revealing their complexity and knowledge - just as the new technologies we've built are threatening to cause their extinction, and ours.  In  Ways of Being , writer and artist James Bridle considers the fascinating, uncanny and multiple ways of existing on earth. What can we learn from these other forms of intelligence and personhood, and how can we change our societies to live more equitably with one another and the non-human world? From Greek oracles to octopuses, forests to satellites, Bridle tells a radical new story about ecology, technology and intelligence. We must, they argue, expand our definition of these terms to build a meaningful and free relationship with the non-human, one based on solidarity and cognitive diversity. We have so much to learn, and many worlds to gain.  'Brilliant ... Bridle shows the importance of listening to one another and our surroundings, and of creating new forms of community' Hans Ulrich Obrist. "

                "ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) is now recognised as one of the most common causes of learning and behavioural difficulties in school-aged children. Symptoms include poor concentration, forgetfulness, poor organisation, impulsivity, restlessness, poor social skills, learning difficulties, low selfesteem, and defiant behaviour. Despite growing awareness of ADHD among parents and health professionals, it is still widely misunderstood. This third edition of ADHD: The Facts provides information on how ADHD is diagnosed, on conventional medical and alternative therapies, and on ways of helping children to improve their own behaviour, selfesteem, and academic results. Written by an experienced paediatrician, the book provides practical advice to help parents understand their child's difficulties and how to overcome them. With detailed explanations of the cause of ADHD, its nature, and treatments of the condition that have proved effective over time, this new edition includes developments in the understanding of conditions that often coexist with it, as well as problems experienced by adults with ADHD. ADHD: The Facts will be of invaluable assistance to parents of children with ADHD and to teachers, psychologists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, and doctors wanting an authoritative, up-to-date, and practical review of the condition.

                "'A riveting chronicle of faulty science, false promises, arrogance, greed, and shocking disregard for the wellbeing of patients suffering from mental disorders. An eloquent, meticulously documented, clear-eyed call for change' Dirk Wittenborn   In this masterful work, Andrew Scull, one of the most provocative thinkers writing about psychiatry, sheds light on its troubled history  For more than two hundred years, disturbances of reason, cognition and emotion - the sort of things that were once called 'madness' - have been described and treated by the medical profession. Mental illness, it is said, is an illness like any other - a disorder that can treated by doctors, whose suffering can be eased, and from which patients can return. And yet serious mental illness remains a profound mystery that is in some ways no closer to being solved than it was at the start of the twentieth century. In this clear-sighted and provocative exploration of psychiatry, acclaimed sociologist Andrew Scull traces the history of its attempts to understand and mitigate mental illness: from the age of the asylum and surgical and chemical interventions, through the rise and fall of Freud and the talking cure, and on to our own time of drug companies and antidepressants. Through it all, Scull argues, the often vain and rash attempts to come to terms with the enigma of mental disorder have frequently resulted in dire consequences for the patient. Deeply researched and lucidly conveyed,  Desperate Remedies  masterfully illustrates the assumptions and theory behind the therapy, providing a definitive new account of psychiatry's and society's battle with mental illness.

Whether it's at work, at home or in public, confronting our differences is the only way to make the most out of them.  How to Disagree  is about how to do that successfully. Drawing on essential lessons from world-class experts on how to disagree well and combining them with inspiring stories of productive disagreements from science, technology and the arts, Ian Leslie reveals how we can reap the benefits of diverse viewpoints in an era that feels more divided than ever. 'I nodded and underlined my way through the book's nearly 300 pages of eloquent, thoughtful advice . . . If you want to argue better, Leslie's manual will be invaluable.'

                "\"A profound and powerful work of essential reporting.\" \u2014The New York Times Book Review    An important\u2014and intimate\u2014interrogation of how we treat mental illness and how we understand ourselves   In the early 1960s, JFK declared that science would take us to the moon. He also declared that science would make the \"remote reaches of the mind accessible\" and cure psychiatric illness with breakthrough medications. We were walking on the moon within the decade. But today, psychiatric cures continue to elude us\u2014as does the mind itself. Why is it that we still don't understand how the mind works? What is the difference between the mind and the brain? And given all that we still don't know, how can we make insightful, transformative choices about our psychiatric conditions?  When Daniel Bergner's younger brother was diagnosed as bipolar and put on a locked ward in the 1980s, psychiatry seemed to have achieved what JFK promised: a revolution of chemical solutions to treat mental illness. Yet as Bergner's brother was deemed a dire risk for suicide and he and his family were told his disorder would be lifelong, he found himself taking heavy doses of medications with devastating side effects.  Now, in recounting his brother's journey alongside the gripping, illuminating stories of Caroline, who is beset by the hallucinations of psychosis, and David, who is overtaken by depression, Bergner examines the evolution of how we treat our psyches. He reveals how the pharmaceutical industry has perpetuated our biological view of the mind and our drug-based assumptions about treatment\u2014despite the shocking price paid by many patients and the problematic evidence of drug efficacy. And he takes us into the pioneering labs of today's preeminent neuroscientists, sharing their remarkably candid reflections and fascinating new theories of treatment.  The Mind and the Moon raises profound questions about how we understand ourselves and the essential human divide between our brains and our minds. This is a book of thought-provoking reframings, delving into the science\u2014and spirit\u2014of our psyches. It is about vulnerability and personal dignity, the terrifying choices confronted by families and patients, and the prospect of alternatives. In The Mind and the Moon, Bergner beautifully explores how to seek a deeper engagement with ourselves and one another\u2014and how to find a better path toward caring for our minds. "

FRANK TURNER  Money, freedom, adoring fans: professional musicians seem to have it all. But beneath the surface lies a frightening truth: for years the music industry has tolerated death, addiction and exploitation in the name of entertainment. In  Bodies , Ian Winwood explores the industry's reluctance to confront its many failures in a far-reaching story which features first-hand access to artists such as Foo Fighters, Green Day, Trent Reznor, Biffy Clyro, Kings of Leon, Chris Cornell, Mark Lanegan, Pearl Jam. Much more than a touchline reporter, Winwood also tells the tale of his own mental-health collapse following the shocking death of his father. Written with warmth, humour and bracing honesty,  Bodies  is a deeply personal story and essential reading for musicians and fans alike. "

                "Very Short Introductions : Brilliant, Sharp, Inspiring   Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological therapy. It is not a unitary approach, but instead has evolved through a range of approaches that share a common underpinning model of cognition (thought) and behaviour being important in understanding and alleviating psychological distress. While the earliest approaches focused on modifying observable behaviour, later versions emphasized cognitive processes. Most recently, the third wave approaches in CBT have moved the focus away from the content of an individual's thoughts to their relationship with their thoughts, and the processes underlying thinking. This Very Short Introduction gives an overview of what CBT is, where it came from, what it does, and when it can be used. It explores how one of the driving forces behind CBT's success and continued adaptation has been its basis in empiricism, and analyses how it must continue to evolve to meet future challenges. Looking to the future, Freda McManus also discusses how the scale of mental health problems and relative costs of traditional therapy formats have prompted investigations into alternative formats of CBT that have the potential to reach broader audiences, globally. She also considers the challenges of scale in training the workforce required to roll out such interventions, as well as those of determining the best ways of monitoring their competence and effectiveness. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable. "

                "'Vivid, unforgettable . . . a fascinating, instructive, wise and compassionate book' John Banville     A leading psychiatrist shows how the mysteries of the brain are illuminated at the extremes of human experience   A twinge of sadness, a rush of love, a knot of loss, a whiff of regret. Memories have the power to move us, often when we least expect it, a sign of the complex neural process that continues in the background of our everyday lives. A process that shapes us: filtering the world around us, informing our behaviour and feeding our imagination.  As a practising psychiatrist, Veronica O'Keane has spent many years observing how memory and experience are interwoven. In this rich, fascinating exploration, she asks, among other things, why can memories feel  so  real? How are our sensations and perceptions connected with them? Why is place so important in memory? Are there such things as 'true' and 'false' memories? And, above all, what happens when the process of memory is disrupted by mental illness? Here O' Keane uses the broken memories of psychosis to illuminate the integrated human brain, offering a new way of thinking about our own personal experiences. Drawing on the poignant stories of her patients and much more, from literature and fairy tales, O'Keane uses the latest neuroscientific research to reframe our understanding of the extraordinary puzzle that is the human brain; from birth through to adolescence and old age. This book is a testament to the courage - and suffering - of those who live with serious mental illness, showing how their experiences unlock everything we know and feel. "

Oddly, the flood never came. In  The End of Trauma , pioneering psychologist George A. Bonanno argues that we failed to predict the psychological response to 9/11 because most of what we understand about trauma is wrong. For starters, it's not nearly as common as we think. In fact, people are overwhelmingly resilient to adversity. What we often interpret as PTSD are signs of a natural process of learning how to deal with a specific situation. We can cope far more effectively if we understand how this process works. Drawing on four decades of research, Bonanno explains what makes us resilient, why we sometimes aren't, and how we can better handle traumatic stress. Hopeful and humane,  The End of Trauma  overturns everything we thought we knew about how people respond to hardship. "

                "How do great leaders thrive in uncertain times? By changing their mindsets about power. If you let go of hierarchy, chaos will reign...or so many leaders believe. But when leaders find the courage to distribute rather than hoard power, creativity multiplies, trust deepens, and inclusivity expands...and a new kind of order emerges. For decades, leaders forced their organizations to look like a pyramid, with all authority flowing from the top. That didn't work. Next, experts told leaders to adopt \"bottom-up\" leadership. But that's not working either. Top-down and bottom-up are the same organizational shape. And neither approach really enables innovation, collaboration, or enthusiasm. The problem is the Pyramid. A few rare leaders have seen the pyramid for the trap that it is and have learned to embrace a new shape and mindset: Constellations. Organizations designed as constellations are dynamic and flexible networks of distinct yet interwoven individuals. Each member of the team feels like a singular star and is also connected to others to form something greater. That is how Visa reimagined how we pay for things, how Wikipedia beat the richest company in the world and how Barack Obama and his grassroots team revolutionized political campaigning. These leaders did what most leaders dread \u2013 they gave away power. In this practical and personal journey, Barzun brilliantly layers lessons across history and industries with his own experiences as an internet entrepreneur, political organizer, and US ambassador to the United Kingdom and Sweden. With lessons for leaders of all types, The Power of Giving Away Power shows how the Constellation mindset shines in some of the most impactful organizations and innovations the world has ever known. And it encourages us all to recognize, as Barzun writes, \"the power we can create by seeing the power in others\" \u2014 and making the leap to lead. Together. "

What if there were parts of our minds which we never use, but if awakened, could make us so much happier, connected and alive? What if awakening those parts could finally solve the conflicts and sufferings we all go through? From the cutting edge, where therapy meets neuroscience, world-renowned author, psychotherapist and educator Steve Biddulph shows us how to reach into the deep feelings beneath our feelings, and how doing so can guide us to a more awake and free way of living every minute of our lives. In  Fully Human , Steve Biddulph guides us through the four-storey mansion of our unexplored mind, with tips on how to open each level up to the sunlight, allowing us to live equally in all its beautiful rooms. Drawing on deeply personal stories from his own life, as well as those of his clients, and from the frontiers of thinking about how the brain works with the body, this culmination of a life's work uncovers how we can all be more alive, more connected.

OBSERVER   'Compulsive reading.'   MIRROR   Serial homicide. Stalking. Arson. Gang crime. Who are the people behind these acts of terrible violence? What are their stories? And what is it like to sit opposite them? Dr Gwen Adshead is one of Britain's leading forensic psychiatrists, and she has spent thirty years providing therapy inside secure hospitals and prisons. Whatever her patient's crime she aims to help them to better know their minds by helping them to articulate their life experience.  Through a collaboration with co-author Eileen Horne, Adshead brings her work to life in these fascinating, unflinching portraits of individuals who newspaper headlines, TV dramas and crime fiction label 'monsters'. Case by case, Adshead takes us into the treatment room and reveals these men and women in all their complexity and vulnerability. She sheds new light on the unpredictable nature of the therapeutic process as doctor and patient try to find words for the unspeakable. These are stories of cruelty and despair but also of change and recovery. In a time of increasing polarisation, in the face of overcrowded prisons and devastating cuts to mental health care, Adshead speaks to our shared humanity and makes the case for compassion over condemnation, empathy over fear.  The Devil You Know  challenges what we think we know about evil. It is a rare book that has the power to change minds. 'Urgent and invaluable.'

In the last hundred years, most of the medical sciences have progressed in immense and unforeseeable ways\u2014except for psychiatry, which has somehow remained immune to this progress. Daniel Barron, a psychiatrist who trained at the Yale School of Medicine, asks an important question: What's holding psychiatry back?  Reading Our Minds  takes us to a psychiatric hospital, where Barron evaluates a young woman with psychosis, and shows how his exam is limited by his own ability to ask questions and observe, and by his patient's ability to sense, interpret, and report her experience. Barron shows why psychiatry must move beyond conversation\u2014and how sensors, measurements, and algorithms might progress psychiatric practice. At once pioneering and engaging,  Reading Our Minds  introduces readers to the Big Data technologies that might revolutionize the way we evaluate, diagnose, and treat mental illness and bring psychiatry firmly into the fold of 21st-century medical science.

Wherever there is human judgment, there is noise. 'A MONUMENTAL, GRIPPING book... OUTSTANDING.' Bryan Appleyard, Sunday Times 'A tour de force of scholarship and clear writing' New York Times 'Noise may be the most important book I've read in more than a decade. A genuinely new idea so\u00a0exceedingly important you will immediately put it into practice. A masterpiece' Angela Duckworth, author of Grit 'An absolutely brilliant investigation of a massive societal problem that has been hiding in plain sight' Steven Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics 'Brilliant. Absolutely terrific' GILLIAN TETT, FINANCIAL TIMES Imagine that two doctors in the same city give different diagnoses to identical patients \u2013 or that two judges in the same court give different sentences to people who have committed matching crimes. Now imagine that the same doctor and the same judge make different decisions depending on whether it is morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday, or they haven't yet had lunch. These are examples of noise: variability in judgments that should be identical. In Noise, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R. Sunstein show how noise produces errors in many fields, including in medicine, law, public health, economic forecasting, forensic science, child protection, creative strategy, performance review and hiring. And although noise can be found wherever people are making judgments and decisions, individuals and organizations alike commonly ignore its impact, at great cost. Packed with new ideas, and drawing on the same kind of sharp analysis and breadth of case study that made Thinking, Fast and Slow and Nudge international bestsellers, Noise explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise and bias in decision-making. We all make bad judgments more than we think. With a few simple remedies, this groundbreaking book explores what we can do to make better ones. "

                "Glial cells play an essential role in initiating and controlling our behaviours, playing a major role in communication between brain cells. They share certain properties with neurons, including the ability to use information from the environment to formulate behaviors. Understanding these cells is key to explaining human movement, emotion, and thoughts. Moreover, glial cells provide a panoply of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This book is the 'brain' child of two scientist physicians: Pierre Magistretti, a leading expert in cerebral metabolism and glial cell biology, and Yves Agid, an expert in the treatment of nervous system diseases and a researcher in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. This book provides many examples of the decisive role glial cells play in the functioning of the human brain, as well as in neurological and psychiatric pathologies. The result is a revolution in our understanding of the brain and a beacon of hope in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. "

Modern medicine treats sick patients like broken machines \u2014 figure out what is physically wrong, fix it, and send the patient on their way. But humans are not machines. When we are ill, we experience our illness: we become scared, distressed, tired, weary. Our illnesses are not just biological conditions, but human ones.  It was Arthur Kleinman, a Harvard psychiatrist and anthropologist, who saw this truth when most of his fellow doctors did not. Based on decades of clinical experience studying and treating chronic illness,  The Illness Narratives  makes a case for interpreting the illness experience of patients as a core feature of doctoring. Before  Being Mortal , there was  The Illness Narratives . It remains today a prescient and passionate case for bridging the gap between patient and practitioner. "

                "When we are baffled by the insanity of the \"other side\"\u2014in our politics, at work, or at home\u2014it's because we aren't seeing how the conflict itself has taken over.  That's what \"high conflict\" does. It's the invisible hand of our time. And it's different from the useful friction of healthy conflict. That's  good  conflict, and it's a necessary force that pushes us to be better people.   High conflict, by contrast, is what happens when discord distills into a good-versus-evil kind of feud, the kind with an  us  and a  them . In this state, the normal rules of engagement no longer apply. The brain behaves differently. We feel increasingly certain of our own superiority and, at the same time, more and more mystified by the other side.    New York Times  bestselling author and award-winning journalist Amanda Ripley investigates how good people get captured by high conflict\u2014and how they break free.   Our journey begins in California, where a world-renowned conflict expert struggles to extract himself from a political feud. Then we meet a Chicago gang leader who dedicates his life to a vendetta\u2014only to find himself working beside the man who killed his childhood idol. Next, we travel to Colombia, to find out whether thousands of people can be nudged out of high conflict at scale. Finally, we return to America to see what happens when a group of liberal Manhattan Jews and conservative Michigan corrections officers choose to stay in each other's homes in order to understand one another better.   All these people, in dramatically different situations, were drawn into high conflict by similar forces, including conflict entrepreneurs, humiliation, and false binaries. But ultimately, all of them found ways to transform high conflict into something good, something that made them better people. They rehumanized and recatego\u00adrized their opponents, and they revived curiosity and wonder, even as they  continued  to fight for what they knew was right.   People  do  escape high conflict. Individuals\u2014even entire communities\u2014can short-circuit the feedback loops of outrage and blame, if they want to. This is a mind-opening new way to think about conflict that will transform how we move through the world. "

Do you cultivate your unique attributes and goals? If so, perhaps you are  WEIRD : raised in a society that is Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic.  Unlike most who have ever lived,  WEIRD  people are highly individualistic, nonconformist, analytical and control-oriented. How did WEIRD populations become so psychologically peculiar? What part did these differences play in our history, and what do they mean for our collective identity?   Joseph Henrich, who developed the game-changing concept of WEIRD , uses leading-edge research in anthropology, psychology, economics and evolutionary biology to explore how changing family structures, marriage practices and religious beliefs in the Middle Ages shaped the Western mind, laying the foundations for the world we know today.  Brilliant, provocative, engaging and surprising, this landmark study will revolutionize your understanding of who - and how - we are now.    'Phenomenal ...

                "A  New York Times  bestselling writer explores what our unique sonic signature reveals about our species, our culture, and each one of us. Finally, a vital topic that has never had its own book gets its due.  There's no shortage of books about public speaking or language or song. But until now, there has been no book about the miracle that underlies them all\u2014the human voice itself. And there are few writers who could take on this surprisingly vast topic with more artistry and expertise than John Colapinto. Beginning with the novel\u2014and compelling\u2014argument that our ability to speak is what made us the planet's dominant species, he guides us from the voice's beginnings in lungfish millions of years ago to its culmination in the talent of Pavoratti, Martin Luther King Jr., and Beyonc\u00e9\u2014and each of us, every day.   Along the way, he shows us why the voice is the most efficient, effective means of communication ever devised: it works in all directions, in all weathers, even in the dark, and it can be calibrated to reach one other person or thousands. He reveals why speech is the single most complex and intricate activity humans can perform. He travels up the Amazon to meet the Piraha, a reclusive tribe whose singular language, more musical than any other, can help us hear how melodic principles underpin every word we utter. He heads up to Harvard to see how professional voices are helped and healed, and he ventures out on the campaign trail to see how demagogues wield their voices as weapons.   As far-reaching as this book is, much of the delight of reading it lies in how intimate it feels. Everything Colapinto tells us can be tested by our own lungs and mouths and ears and brains. He shows us that, for those who pay attention, the voice is an eloquent means of communicating not only what the speaker means, but also their mood, sexual preference, age, income, even psychological and physical illness.   It overstates the case only slightly to say that anyone who talks, or sings, or listens will find a rich trove of thrills in  This Is the Voice . "

                "A groundbreaking new behavioral model that explains what drives us, and  why .  From tireless marketers to pandering politicians, the forces of modernity have lulled us into lazy categorizations of people, erasing the natural nuances of being human. We are all now accustomed to being reduced to a demographic\u2014man, woman, black, white, old, young. But while these factors may inform our lived experience, what if there is something more fundamentally important that determines our behavior?   Bob Raleigh, founder of PathSight Predictive Science, argues that biological  instincts  are the most foundational determinants of our behavior. PathSight has pioneered a new model that draws on the latest findings in neuroscience, data science, and behavioral science to classify people in five distinct groups, depending on what they instinctively care about most: nurturing, fairness, loyalty, authority, or purity. Their data, drawn from large-scale studies with over 50,000 participants, show that people who share the same instinctual patterns will engage the world in extremely predictable ways, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, income, and education.   Knowing the impact that instinct has on behavior has all kinds of advantages. You can tailor any communication to make it maximally effective for a particular audience. You can strive to empathize with a person you've always found mystifying. And of course, understanding what truly makes  you  tick is an invaluable step on your journey to self-discovery. In  The Search for Why,  Bob Raleigh offers the missing link that all the big data in the world can't deliver. "

Should I worry about binge-watching TV? What time should I go to bed?  We make, and worry about, a thousand big and little decisions during our waking hours.
