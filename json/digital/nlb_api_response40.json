                "Storytelling and singing continue to be a vital part of community life for Native peoples today. Voices from Four Directions gathers stories and songs from thirty-one Native groups in North America-including the In\u0303upiaqs in the frigid North, the Lushootseeds along the forested coastline of the far West, the Catawbas in the humid South, and the Maliseets of the rugged woods of the East. Vivid stories of cosmological origins and transformation, historical events remembered and retold, as well as legendary fables can be found in these pages. Well-known Trickster figures like Raven, Rabbit, and Coyote figure prominently in several tales as do heroes of local fame such as Tom Laporte of the Maliseets. The stories and songs entertain, instruct, and recall rich legacies as well as obligations. Many are retellings and reinventions of classic narratives, while others are more recent creations. "

How will she know where to find the tooth? What if she goes to the wrong room? To help the Tooth Fairy remember her training, the children devise a plan that will guarantee her success!  With the right supplies\u2014colored paper, crayons or pens, scissors, stickers and glitter, and ribbon\u2014young readers who have a wiggly tooth or have recently lost a baby tooth can also help train their Tooth Fairy by making a sign for their bedroom doors similar to the ones the children make in the book.  Fliess's bouncy read-aloud rhyming text and Sanfilippo's energetic, whimsical illustrations will bring joy to young readers as they watch the children create a scene that will direct the little Tooth Fairy to the tooth she seeks.

England, 1388: All her life, Louisa has dreamed of finding the rumored \"Giant's Treasure,\" a collection of ancient, lost riches said to be hidden on a mountaintop in Scotland, guarded by a fierce monster. It's a story her father used to tell her, and when he dies and she and her younger sister have to go live with their shiftless, greedy uncle, Louisa is determined to find that treasure. It's the hope that has kept her defying her uncle's efforts to marry her off to the highest bidder.  After her uncle starts to parade Louisa's twelve-year-old sister Margaret in front of potential husbands, Louisa realizes she has no time to waste. She disguises herself as a boy and takes off for Scotland. But the road is a harsher place than she'd imagined, and she is relieved to find a friend in the knight, Sir Charles, who goes along with her on her journey.  Charles is intrigued by this young woman who claims her name is \"Jack\" and is set on going to Scotland. He goes along, pretending to believe she is a boy, in order to make sure nothing bad happens to her. As they meet new friends along the road, and as Louisa comes clean about her identity, the pair find themselves falling in love. But what will happen when they reach Scotland? Will they find their independence and the freedom to marry in the form of a buried treasure, or will the monster from Louisa's own past keep the young couple apart?  A delightfully charming reimagining of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" from New York Times bestselling author Melanie Dickerson.

Rosamund has found the Princess Protection Program, where fugitive fairy-tale princesses escape unwanted affections, untimely ends, and all the other perils of their stories.  But the longer Rosamund lives in the real world, the more questions she has. Does anyone ever graduate from the HEA? Why doesn't anyone seem to remember the former students? Is the kindly fairy headmistress all she appears to be? Is anyone? And the most important question of all: Can Rosamund change her story?  Acclaimed and bestselling author Alex London weaves together several beloved fairy tales in this fast-paced, funny, and slyly subversive adventure about finding your place in the world. "
