Archie's life\u2014and the whole world\u2014is turned upside down by Covid-19. Suddenly there are no more Friday night dinners out, no more going to school, no more hanging out with friends . . . no leaving the house  at all.   Even though he's inside with his family all day every day, Archie can't help but feel more alone than ever before. While everyone else seems to be adapting to their new normal just fine, it's like Archie is permanently on mute, unable to find the words to describe how he feels\u2014and sometimes, unable to find someone who will listen. The bright spot of Archie's days at home is watching and learning about the hummingbirds that feed outside his windows. But just when it seems like this could be what brings his family together again, California experiences its worst wildfire in history, and Archie's favorite hummingbird disappears. In a time when hope is hard to hold on to, Archie must find his voice and find hope once again.  Hummingbird Season  is an honest and healing novel in verse documenting the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic and the things that bring us together when circumstances keep us apart. "

I call their names:    Abram Alice Amey Arianna Antiqua   I call their names:    Isaac Jake James Jenny Jim   Every last one, property of the Lloyds,     the state's preeminent enslavers.     Every last one, with a mind of their own     and a story that ain't yet been told.     Till now.    Carole and Jeffery Boston Weatherford's ancestors are among the founders of Maryland. Their family history there extends more than three hundred years, but as with the genealogical searches of many African Americans with roots in slavery, their family tree can only be traced back five generations before going dark. And so from scraps of history, Carole and Jeffery have conjured the voices of their kin, creating an often painful but ultimately empowering story of who their people were in a breathtaking book that is at once deeply personal yet all too universal.   Carole's poems capture voices ranging from her ancestors to Frederick Douglass to Harriet Tubman to the plantation house and land itself that connects them all, and Jeffery's evocative illustrations help carry the story from the first mention of a forebear listed as property in a 1781 ledger to he and his mother's homegoing trip to Africa in 2016. Shaped by loss, erasure, and ultimate reclamation, this is the story of not only Carole and Jeffery's family, but of countless other Black families in America. "

After cursing at a classmate, her father forces her to volunteer at their church with Pastor Johnson. But Pastor Johnson isn't the holy man everyone thinks he is. The same voice Amina uses to fight falls quiet the night she is sexually assaulted by Pastor Johnson.

Temp jobs, conspiracy theories, squatters, talk therapy, urban gardening, the robot revolution: this collection fixes its eye on the strangeness of labor, through poems that are searching, keen, and wry. The virtuosic central sequence explores the untimely death of the poet's estranged father, a handyman and addict, and the brothers left to sort through the detritus of a life long lost to them. Through lyrical, darkly humorous vignettes, Kunz asks what it costs to build a home and a love that not only lasts but sustains. "

Ever since twelve-year-old Josh Kline found an antisemitic note in his family\u2019s mailbox in third grade, he has felt uncomfortable about his Jewish identity. At a new school where he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s the only Jew, he\u2019s hoping to just keep religion out of everything . . . until the morning someone sprays swastikas all over the building. That\u2019s when everything changes. In one of the school counseling groups set up in response to the attack, Josh finally reveals that he is Jewish, and quickly finds out there\u2019s more to the other kids in his grade too: All of them have their own struggles. Maybe Josh can do something to help\u2014to \u201crepair the world\u201d as his rabbi teaches, by starting a Do More club to spread kindness. But making a difference is never simple, even when you have new friends by your side. Fast-paced and conversation-starting, Josh\u2019s story is an empowering examination of prejudice, bullying, and how to take the first step toward change. "

Elaborately mapping an interconnected route in and out of the museum through history, material, and memory,  Information Desk: An Epic  takes us on an anguished soul-quest and ecstatic intellectual query to confront the violent forces that inform the museum\u2019s encyclopedic collection and the spiritual powers of art. Novelistic in its sweep, frantically informative, and deeply intimate in its private recollections,  Information Desk: An Epic  wayfares with riveting lyric intensity through an epic array of topics and concerns, including illusion, deception, self-deception, complicity, lecherous coworkers, the composition of pigment, the scattering of seeds, ideas, and capital, and insect infestations spreading within artwork. Along the way, Schiff pauses to invoke three terrifying muses\u2014parasitic wasps\u2014in desperate awe of their powers of precision and generative energy.  Information Desk: An Epic  undertakes a hemorrhaging ekphrastic journey through artifice and the natural world. "

                "Swan Lake  meets  The Last Unicorn  by way of the Brothers Grimm in a dreamy, original fairytale in verse which transports readers to the Bavarian Alps.  Bavaria. 1880. Hilde was dreamed into existence by the god Odin, and along with her five sisters, granted cloaks that transform them into swans. Each sister\u2019s cloak is imbued with a unique gift, but Hilde rejects her gift which connects her to the souls of dying creatures and forces her to shepherd them into the afterlife\u2014the \u201cOther Wood.\u201d While guiding the soul of a hawk to the Other Wood, Hilde meets the handsome Baron Maximilian von Richter, whose father was once a favorite of the king and left him no inheritance. Hilde is intrigued by Richter\u2019s longing for a greater life and strikes a deal with him: She will manifest his dreams of riches, and in return, he will take her to the human world, where she will never have to guide souls again. But at the court of King Ludwig II in Munich, Hilde struggles to fit in. After learning that fashionable ladies are having themselves painted, she hires non-binary Jewish artist Franz Mendelson, and is stunned when Franz renders her with swan wings. The more time she spends with Franz, the more she feels drawn to the artist\u2019s warm, understanding nature, and the more controlling Richter becomes. When Hilde\u2019s swan cloak suddenly goes missing, only Franz\u2019s ability to paint souls can help Hilde escape her newfound prison. "

There she meets Dariel, a Cuban American boy whose enigmatic music enchants birds and animals\u2014and Soleida.   Together they work to protect the environment and bring attention to the imprisoned artists in Cuba. Soon they discover that love isn't about falling\u2014it's about soaring together to new heights.

For Every One  is exactly that: for every one. For every one person. For every one who has a dream. But especially for every kid. The kids who dream of being better than they are. Kids who dream of doing more than they almost dare to imagine. Kids who are like Jason Reynolds, a self-professed dreamer. Jason does not claim to know how to make dreams come true; he has, in fact, been fighting on the front line of his own battle to make his own dreams a reality. He expected to make it when he was sixteen. Then eighteen. Then twenty-five. Now, some of those expectations have been realized. But others, the most important ones, lay ahead, and a lot of them involve kids, how to inspire  them : All the kids who are scared to dream, or don't know how to dream, or don't dare to dream because they've NEVER seen a dream come true. Jason wants kids to know that dreams take time. They involve countless struggles. But no matter how many times a dreamer gets beat down, the drive and the passion and the hope never fully extinguishes\u2014because simply having the dream is the start you need, or you won't get anywhere anyway, and that is when you have to take a leap of faith.   A pitch-perfect graduation, baby, or inspirational gift for anyone who needs to me reminded of their own abilities\u2014to dream. "

Acclaimed author Christine Heppermann's novel-in-verse tackles betrayals and redemption among family and friends with her signature unflinching\u2014but always sharply witty\u2014style.  For fans of Elana K. Arnold, Laura Ruby, and A. S. King.    When Jorie wakes up in the loft bed of a college boy she doesn't recognize, she's instantly filled with regret. What happened the night before? What led her to this place? Was it her father's infidelity? Her mother's seemingly weak acceptance? Her recent breakup with Ian, the boy who loved her art and supported her through the hardest time of her life?   As Jorie tries to reconstruct the events that led her to this point, free verse poems lead the reader through the current morning, as well as flashbacks to her relationships with her parents, her friends, her boyfriend, and the previous night.   With Poisoned Apples: Poems for You, My Pretty and Ask Me How I Got Here, Christine Heppermann established herself as a vital voice in thought-provoking and powerful feminist writing for teens. Her poetry is surprising, wry, emotional, and searing. What Goes Up is by turns a scorchingly funny and a deeply emotional story that asks whether it's possible to support and love someone despite the risk of being hurt. Readers of Laura Ruby, E. K. Johnston, Elana K. Arnold, and Laurie Halse Anderson will find a complicated heroine they won't soon forget. "

At the age of six, she poured her pain onto a piece of paper late one night - and discovered the magic and impact of writing. For many years, Nikki's notebooks were her most enduing companions. In this accessible and inspiring memoir that will resonate with young readers and adults alike, Nikki shows how the power of those words helped her conquer the hazards - ordinary and extraordinary - of her life.

But five weeks after the incident, Angel finds herself in Brooklyn, far from her family, from him, and from the California life she has known. \u00a0 Angel feels out of sync with her new neighborhood. At school, she can\u2019t shake the feeling everyone knows what happened\u2014and that it was her fault. The only place that makes sense is Ms. G\u2019s class. There, Angel\u2019s classmates share their own stories of pain, joy, and fortitude. And as Angel becomes immersed in her revolutionary literature course, the words from Black writers like Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, and Zora NEale Hurston\u00a0speak to her and begin to heal the wounds of her past.

Junk. That's what the kids at school call Bobby Lang, mostly because his rundown house looks like a junkyard, but also because they want to put him down. Trying desperately to live under the radar at school\u2014and at the home he shares with his angry, neglectful father\u2014Bobby develops a sort of proud loneliness. The only buffer between him and the uncaring world is his love of the long, wooded trail between school and home.  Life grinds along quietly and hopelessly for Bobby until he meets Rachel. Rachel is an artist who sees him in a way no one ever has. Maybe it's because she has her own kind of junk, and a parent who hates what Rachel is: gay. Together the two embark on journeys to clean up the messes that fill their lives, searching against all odds for hope and redemption.  Narrated in Bobby's unique voice in arresting free verse, this novel will captivate readers right from its opening lines, urging them on page after page, all the way to its explosive conclusion. "

The amiable voice, the light touch, the sudden turn at the end. He \"puts the \u2018fun\u2019\u00a0 back in profundity,\u201d says poet Alice Fulton. In his own words, his poems tend to \u201cbegin in Kansas and end in Oz.\u201d Now \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite poet\u201d ( The Wall Street Journal ) has found a new form for his unique poetic style: the small poem. Here Collins writes about his trademark themes of nature, animals, poetry, mortality, absurdity, and love\u2014all in a handful of lines. Neither haiku nor limerick, the small poem pushes to an extreme poetry\u2019s famed power to condense emotional and conceptual meaning. Inspired by the small poetry of writers as diverse as William Carlos Williams, W.S.

Aimless Love  combines new poems with selections from four previous books\u2014 Nine Horses, The Trouble with Poetry, Ballistics,  and  Horoscopes for the Dead.  Collins\u2019s unmistakable voice, which brings together plain speech with imaginative surprise, is clearly heard with every word, reminding us how he has managed to enrich the tapestry of contemporary poetry and greatly expand its audience. His work is featured in top literary magazines such as  The New Yorker ,  Poetry , and  The Atlantic , and he sells out reading venues all across the country. Appearing regularly in  The Best American Poetry  series, his poems appeal to readers and live audiences far and wide and have been translated into more than a dozen languages. By turns playful, ironic, and serious, Collins\u2019s poetry captures the nuances of everyday life while leading the reader into zones of inspired wonder. In the poet\u2019s own words, he hopes that his poems \u201cbegin in Kansas and end in Oz.\u201d Touching on the themes of love, loss, joy, and poetry itself, these poems showcase the best work of this \u201cpoet of plenitude, irony, and Augustan grace\u201d  (The New Yorker).

                "A farm-working girl with big dreams meets activist Dolores Huerta and joins the 1965 protest for workers\u2019 rights in this tender-hearted novel in verse, perfect for fans of Rita Williams-Garcia and Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan.  Lula Viramontes aches to one day become someone whom no one can ignore: a daring ringleader in a Mexican traveling circus. But between working the grape harvest in Delano, California, with her older siblings under dangerous conditions; taking care of her younger siblings and Mam\u00e1, who has mysteriously fallen ill; and doing everything she can to avoid Pap\u00e1\u2019s volatile temper, it\u2019s hard to hold on to those dreams. Then she meets Dolores Huerta, Larry Itliong, and other labor rights activists and realizes she may need to raise her voice sooner rather than later: Farmworkers are striking for better treatment and wages, and whether Lula\u2019s family joins them or not will determine their future.  * This audiobook edition includes a downloadable PDF that contains resources to learn more about the subjects explored in the book.

These poetic prescriptions and wise words of advice offer comfort, delight and inspiration for all; a space for reflection, and that precious realization - I'm not the only one who feels like this.

This audiobook presents the most essential poems in his dispensary: those which, again and again, have really shown themselves to work. Whether you are suffering from loneliness, lack of courage, heartbreak, hopelessness, or even from an excess of ego, there is something here to ease your pain. 'The book is delightful; it rightly resituates poetryin relation to its biggest and most serious task: helping us to live and diewell' Alain de Botton 'Truly a marvellous collection ... There is balm for the soul, fire for the belly, a cooling compress for the fevered brow, solace for the wounded, an arm around the lonely shoulder - the whole collection is a matchless compound of hug, tonic and kiss' Stephen Fry.

To perceive ourselves in other beings\u2014and to know that those beings are resolutely their own, that they \"do not / care to be seen as symbols\"? With Lim\u00f3n's remarkable ability to trace thought, The Hurting Kind explores those questions\u2014incorporating others' stories and ways of knowing, making surprising turns, and always reaching a place of startling insight. These poems slip through the seasons, teeming with horses and kingfishers and the gleaming eyes of fish. And they honor parents, stepparents, and grandparents: the sacrifices made, the separate lives lived, the tendernesses extended to a hurting child; the abundance, in retrospect, of having two families.  Along the way, we glimpse loss. There are flashes of the pandemic, ghosts whose presence manifests in unexpected memories and the mysterious behavior of pets left behind. But The Hurting Kind is filled, above all, with connection and the delight of being in the world. \"Slippery and waddle thieving my tomatoes still / green in the morning's shade,\" writes Lim\u00f3n of a groundhog in her garden, \"she is doing what she can to survive.\" "

It is 00:00 and the full of the night yet to come.  A man sits at a window through the dead hours of night, his sleep broken by troubling dreams of a figure in a white landscape. This fragmentary vigil anchors a series of narrative sections in which a dramatic voice - which might well be an interior monologue - gives, first, an account of the man, then addresses him directly. We learn of a conflicted childhood, of love lost to circumstance, of the press of death on the protagonist's waking thoughts. He is a man afflicted by personal loss, but also a man of his time, all too aware of the troubled world in which he lives.  In this powerful sequence, David Harsent's breathtaking formal skills are always in evidence. Intense, lyrical and passionate,  Loss  makes for enthralling reading.  'A master of the human drama.'

Written in accessible verse, this timely story of environmental activism has extensive back matter for aspiring activists. With a foreword by Melati Wijsen, cofounder of Bye, Bye Plastic Bags.   Mimi has a plan for her seventh grade year: play piano in the Young Artists competition at Carnegie Hall with her best friend, Lee; enjoy a good old Massachusetts snow day or two; and work in her community garden plot with her dad. But all that changes when her family's Greek restaurant falls on hard times.  The Laskarises' relocation to Wilford Island, Florida, is a big key change for Mimi. Where does she fit in in this shell-covered paradise without Lee? Mimi is taken by the beauty of the island and alarmed by the plastic pollution she sees on the beaches.  Then her science teacher, Ms. Miller, shows her class a TED Talk by Melati and Isabel Wijsen. At ages twelve and ten, they lobbied to ban single-use plastic bags on their home island of Bali\u2014and won. Their story strikes a chord for Mimi. She's twelve.  Could a kid like her make such a big change in a place that she's not yet sure feels like home? Can she manage to keep up with piano, her schoolwork, and activism? And does confident and flawless Carmen Alvarez-Hill really want to help her with the movement?  In this story of environmental activism, friendship, and self-discovery, Mimi figures out what's truly important to her, and takes her place in the ranks of real-life youth activists like the Wijsen sisters, Greta Thunberg, and Isra Hirsi.

The poems reflect a life well-travelled and well-lived; from growing up in the town of Enniscorthy, wandering the streets of Dublin and Barcelona, and crossing the bridges of Venice to visiting the White House, readers will travel through familiar locations and new destinations through T\u00f3ib\u00edn's unique lens.     Within this rich collection of poems written over the course of several decades, shot through with keen observation, emotion and humour, T\u00f3ib\u00edn offers us lines and verses to provoke, ponder and cherish.

                "A teacher asked me a question, and I opened my mouth as a sort of formality but closed it softly, knowing with perfect certainty that nothing would ever come out again. Ruby gives up talking at a young age. Her mother isn't always there to notice; she comes and goes and goes and comes, until, one day, she doesn't. Silence becomes Ruby's refuge, sheltering her from the weather of her mother's mental illness and a pressurized suburban atmosphere. Plangent, deft, and sparkling with wry humor, 'Somebody Loves You' is a moving exploration of how we choose or refuse to tell the stories that shape us. Perfect for fans of Avni Doshi, Ocean Vuong and Abi Dar\u00e9. 'A sharply drawn world of wonder in elegant and lean prose. A fresh, innovative novel that is an ode to families, coming of age and sisterhood.' Roger Robinson 'A truly enriching read, Somebody Loves You is a glorious debut novel. I took this book with me everywhere and kept returning to it. I loved every perfect choice of word and turn of phrase in this vivid and tender, poetic and beautiful book.' Salena Godden 'Each sentence has the cadence of poetry, each phrase perfectly chosen, each word correctly weighed. This is a novel which reminds us memory and narrative are often not complete but rather are crystallised glimpses, which turn like a kaleidoscope through our mind.' Andrew McMillan Mona Arshi was born in West London, where she still lives. She worked as a human-rights lawyer with the NGO Liberty for a decade before receiving a Master's in creative writing from the University of East Anglia. Her debut poetry collection Small Hands was published in 2015, winning the Forward Prize for Best First Collection. Mona Arshi regularly appears on BBC Radio 4. Her poems have been published in The Sunday Times, The Guardian and The Times of India and most recently the London Underground. "

Alma's life is a series of halfways: She's half-Chinese, half-Jewish; her parents spend half the time fighting, and the other half silent; and she's halfway through becoming a woman. But as long as she can listen to her Walkman, hang out with her friends on the stoops of the Village, and ride her bike around the streets of New York, it feels like everything will be all right. Then comes the year when everything changes, and her life is overtaken by constant endings: friends move away, romances bloom and wither, her parents divorce and\u2014just like that\u2014her life as she knew it is over. In this world of confusing beginnings, middles, and endings, is Alma ready to press play on the soundtrack of her life?. "

Feeling like a failure, he comforts himself with food. Garvey is kind, funny, smart, a loyal friend, and he is also overweight, teased by bullies, and lonely. When his only friend encourages him to join the school chorus, Garvey's life changes. The chorus finds a new soloist in Garvey, and through chorus, Garvey finds a way to accept himself, and a way to finally reach his distant father-by speaking the language of music instead of the language of sports. This emotionally resonant novel in verse by award-winning author Nikki Grimes celebrates choosing to be true to yourself. "

                "A bountiful group of poems\u2014direct, honest, and revelatory\u2014that reflect on language, nature, old age, young love, Judaism, and our current politics, from one of our most read and admired poets   \"Words are my business,\" Marge Piercy begins her twentieth collection of poetry, a glance back at a lifetime of learning, loving, grieving, and fighting for the disenfranchised, and a look forward at what the future holds for herself, her family and friends, and her embattled country. In the opening section, Piercy tells of her childhood in Detroit, with its vacant lots and scrappy children, the bike that gave her wings, her ambition at fourteen to \"gobble\" down all knowledge, and a too-early marriage (\"I put on my first marriage / like a girdle my skinny body / didn't need\"). We then leap into the present, her \"twilight zone,\" where she is \"learning to be quiet,\" learning to give praise despite it all. There are funny poems about medicine ads with their dire warnings, and some possible plusses about being dead: \"I'll never do another load of laundry . . .\" There is \"comfort in old bodies / coming together,\" in a partner's warmth\u2014\"You're always warm: warm hands / smooth back sleek as a Burmese cat./ Sunny weather outside and in.\"  Piercy has long been known for her political poems, and here we have her thoughts on illegal immigrants, dying languages, fraught landscapes, abortion, President-speak. She examines her nonbeliever's need for religious holidays and spiritual depth, and the natural world is appreciated throughout.  On the Way Out, Turn Off the Light  is yet more proof of Piercy's love and mastery of language\u2014it is moving, stimulating, funny, and full of the stuff of life. "

Sarai is a first-generation Puerto Rican eighth grader who can see with clarity the truth, pain, and beauty of the world both inside and outside her Bushwick apartment. Together with her older sister Estrella, she navigates the strain of family traumas and the systemic pressures of toxic masculinity and housing insecurity in a rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn. Sarai questions the society around her, her Boricua identity, and the life she lives with determination and an open heart, learning to celebrate herself in a way that she has been denied.   When We Make It  is a love letter to anyone who was taught to believe that they would not make it. To those who  feel  their emotions before they can name them. To those who still may not have all the language but they have their story. Velasquez\u2019 debut novel is sure to leave an indelible mark on all who read it. \u00a0. "

If music is sound organized in a particular way, poetry is a way of organizing language. It is language made special so that it will be remembered and valued. It does not always work\u2014over the centuries countless thousands of poems have been forgotten. This little history is about some that have not.  John Carey tells the stories behind the world's greatest poems, from the oldest surviving one written nearly four thousand years ago to those being written today. Carey looks at poets whose works shape our views of the world, such as Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Whitman, and Yeats. He also looks at more recent poets, like Derek Walcott, Marianne Moore, and Maya Angelou, who have started to question what makes a poem \"great\" in the first place. This little history shines a light on the richness and variation of the world's poems\u2014and the elusive quality that makes them all the more enticing. "

Merc gives them everything: parties, perks, wild nights\u2014plus hours and hours in the recording studio. Even the painful sacrifices and the lies the girls have to tell are all worth it.

As the dream turns into a nightmare, she must make a choice: lose her big break, or get broken. Inspired by true events,  Muted  is a fearless exploration of the dark side of the music industry, the business of exploitation, how a girl's dreams can be used against her\u2014and what it takes to fight back.

                "Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author  In recognition of her long and lauded career as a master essayist, a landmark collection including her most beloved pieces and some rarely seen work, rigorously curated by the author herself  &#8220Annie Dillard's books are like comets, like celestial events that remind us that the reality we inhabit is itself a celestial event.&#8221\u2014Marilynne Robinson, Washington Post Book World  &#8220Annie Dillard is, was, and will always be the very best at describing the landscapes in which we find ourselves.&#8221\u2014Minneapolis Star Tribune  &#8220Annie Dillard is a writer of unusual range, generosity, and ambition. . . . Her prose is bracingly intelligent, lovely, and human. &#8221\u2014Margot Livesey, Boston Globe   &#8220A writer who never seems tired, who has never plodded her way through a page or sentence, Dillard can only be enjoyed by a wide-awake reader,&#8221 warns Geoff Dyer in his introduction to this stellar collection. Carefully culled from her past work, The Abundance is quintessential Annie Dillard, delivered in her fierce and undeniably singular voice, filled with fascinating detail and metaphysical fact. The pieces within will exhilarate both admiring fans and a new generation of readers, having been &#8220re-framed and re-hung,&#8221 with fresh editing and reordering by the author, to situate these now seminal works within her larger canon.  The Abundance reminds us that Dillard's brand of &#8220novelized nonfiction&#8221 pioneered the form long before it came to be widely appreciated. Intense, vivid, and fearless, her work endows the true and seemingly ordinary aspects of life\u2014a commuter chases snowball-throwing children through neighborhood streets, a teenager memorizes Rimbaud's poetry\u2014with beauty and irony, inviting readers onto sweeping landscapes, to join her in exploring the complexities of time and death, with a sense of humor: on one page, an eagle falls from the sky with a weasel attached to its throat; on another, a man walks into a bar.  Reminding us of the indelible contributions of this formative figure in contemporary nonfiction, The Abundance exquisitely showcases Annie Dillard's enigmatic, enduring genius, as Dillard herself wishes it to be marked.

                "'Carol Ann Duffy is considered a top poet. But she deserves better. She deserves to outsell most of the novelists on your shelf '  Observer    The effortless virtuosity, directness, drama and humanity of Carol Ann Duffy's verse have made her our most admired and best-loved contemporary poet.   Sincerity  is Duffy's final collection of poems as Poet Laureate, and the much-anticipated successor to the Costa Award-winning  The Bees . Time and its passage are at the heart of this reflective work, which gazes out from the autumn of life. There are moving elegies here for what has departed; whether that be children who have flown the nest, a way of life, literary luminaries, past loves, lost parents or our own youth. As Duffy dramatizes scenes from childhood, adolescence and adulthood, she finds moments of grace or consolation in memory, love and language amid the complexities of life.  This collection finds a poet at the height of her powers using her full poetic range, casting her eye both inwards, in poems of a deeply personal nature, and yet also outwards, taking stock of a world in turmoil. In some of her most radical work yet, we see Duffy satirise and unpick the deception and dishonesty at the heart of our current political situation. A rallying cry builds steadily through the book culminating in a moving closing ode to the virtue of sincerity.  A fitting culmination to her time as a Poet Laureate, this collection, at once intimate and public, is a work of great power from one of our most cherished and humane poets. "

Traditional fairytales are rife with cliches and gender stereotypes: beautiful, silent princesses; ugly, jealous, and bitter villainesses; girls who need rescuing; and men who take all the glory.  But in this rousing new prose and poetry collection, Nikita Gill gives Once Upon a Time a much-needed modern makeover. Through her gorgeous reimagining of fairytale classics and spellbinding original tales, she dismantles the old-fashioned tropes that have been ingrained in our minds. In this book, gone are the docile women and male saviors. Instead, lines blur between heroes and villains. You will meet fearless princesses, a new kind of wolf lurking in the concrete jungle, and an independent Gretel who can bring down monsters on her own.  Complete with beautifully hand-drawn illustrations by Gill herself,  Fierce Fairytales  is an empowering collection of poems and stories for a new generation. "

Rapture , her seventh collection, is a book-length love-poem, and a moving act of personal testimony; but what sets these poems apart from other treatments of the subject is that Duffy refuses to simplify the contradictions of love, and read its transformations - infatuation, longing, passion, commitment, rancour, separation and grief - as simply redemptive or destructive.    Rapture  is a map of real love, in all its churning complexity. Yet in showing us that a song can be made of even the most painful episodes in our lives, Duffy has accessed a new level of directness that sacrifices nothing in the way of subtlety of expression. These are poems that will find deep rhymes in the experience of most readers, and nowhere has Duffy more eloquently articulated her belief that poetry should speak for us all. "
