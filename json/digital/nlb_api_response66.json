Combining linguistics and cultural history, Gaston Dorren takes us on an intriguing tour of the continent, from Proto-Indo-European (the common ancestor of most European languages) to the rise and rise of English, via the complexities of Welsh plurals and Czech pronunciation. Along the way we learn why Esperanto will never catch on, how the language of William the Conqueror lives on in the Channel Islands and why Finnish is the easiest European language.    Surprising, witty and full of extraordinary facts, this book will change the way you think about the languages around you. Polyglot Gaston Dorren might even persuade you that English is like Chinese.

This hilarious collection of shockingly dreadful job applications, crap CVs and excruciating interviews will have you laughing out loud, while also making you feel so much better about yourself - because at least you weren't ever this bad . . .  Application for Employment    I refer to the recent death of the Technical Manager at your company and hereby apply for the replacement of the deceased manager.    Each time I apply for a job, I get a reply that there is no vacancy but in this case I have caught you red-handed and you have no excuse because I even attended the funeral to be sure that he was truly dead and buried before applying.    Attached to my letter is a copy of my CV and his death certificate.   The Interview:  Q. Is there anything about this job that you feel you might not be very good at? A. Dealing with people. Q.

Will I ever have sex again? Why should I paint my face like a tiger? Wise and candid, this is the most truthful parenting guide of all time.

In  Made in America , Bryson tells the story of how American arose out of the English language, and along the way, de-mythologizes his native land - explaining how a dusty desert hamlet with neither woods nor holly became Hollywood, how the Wild West wasn't won, why Americans say 'lootenant' and 'Toosday', how they were eating junk food long before the word itself was cooked up - as well as exposing the true origins of the words G-string, blockbuster, poker and snafu.

                "Andrew Collins was born 37 years ago in Northampton. His parents never split up, in fact they rarely exchanged a cross word. No-one abused him. Nobody died. He got on well with his brother and sister and none of his friends drowned in a canal. He has never stayed overnight in a hospital and has no emotional scars from his upbringing, except a slight lingering resentment that Anita Barker once mocked the stabilisers on his bike. Where Did It All Go Right? is a jealous memoir written by someone who occasionally wishes life had dealt him a few more juicy marketable blows. The author delves back into his first 18 years in search of something - anything - that might have left him deeply and irreparably damaged. With tales of bikes, telly, sweets, good health, domestic harmony and happy holidays, Andrew aims to bring a little hope to all those out there living with the emotional after-effects of a really nice childhood. Andrew Collins kept a diary from the age of five, so he... "

As an admissions officer specializing in diversity recruitment for independent prep schools, she persuaded students and families to embark on the same perilous journey she herself had made\u2014to attend cutthroat and largely white schools similar to The Taft School, where she had been the first African-American legacy student only a few years earlier. Her new job forced her to reflect on her own elite education experience, and to realize how disillusioned she had become with America's inequitable system. In ADMISSIONS, Kendra looks back at the three years she spent at Taft, chronicling clashes with her lily-white roommate, how she had to unlearn the respectability politics she'd been raised with, and the fall-out from a horrifying article in the student newspaper that accused Black and Latinx students of being responsible for segregation of campus. Through these stories, some troubling, others hilarious, she deconstructs the lies and half-truths she herself would later tell as an admissions professional, in addition to the myths about boarding schools perpetuated by popular culture. With its combination of incisive social critique and uproarious depictions of elite nonsense, ADMISSIONS will resonate with anyone who has ever been The Only One in a room, dealt with racial microaggressions, or even just suffered from an extreme case of homesickness.

But he also knows that proximity to people who are different from ourselves can be a cure for racism.   Tyler Merritt's video \"Before You Call the Cops\" has been viewed millions of times. He's appeared on  Jimmy Kimmel  and  Sports Illustrated  and has been profiled in the  New York Times . The viral video's main point\u2014the more you know someone, the more empathy, understanding, and compassion you have for that person\u2014is the springboard for this book. By sharing his highs and exposing his lows, Tyler welcomes us into his world in order to help bridge the divides that seem to grow wider every day. In  I Take My Coffee Black,  Tyler tells hilarious stories from his own life as a black man in America. He talks about growing up in a multi-cultural community and realizing that he wasn't always welcome, how he quit sports for musical theater (that's where the girls were) to how Jesus barged in uninvited and changed his life forever (it all started with a Triple F.A.T. Goose jacket) to how he ended up at a small Bible college in Santa Cruz because he thought they had a great theater program (they didn't). Throughout his stories, he also seamlessly weaves in lessons about privilege, the legacy of lynching and sharecropping and why you don't cross black mamas. He teaches readers about the history of encoded racism that still undergirds our society today. By turns witty, insightful, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny,  I Take My Coffee Black  paints a portrait of black manhood in America and enlightens, illuminates, and entertains\u2014ultimately building the kind of empathy that might just be the antidote against the racial injustice in our society.

Now, in  Survival of the Thickest , Michelle reflects on growing up Caribbean, Catholic, and thick in New Jersey, going to college in Miami (where everyone smells like pineapple), her many friendship and dating disasters, working as a newsroom editor during 9/11, getting started in standup opening for male strippers, marrying into her husband's Dutch family, IVF and surrogacy, motherhood, chosen family, and what it feels like to have a full heart, tight jeans, and stardom finally in her grasp.

And sometimes two words that sound alike can be spelled completely differently. Ptolemy the pterodactyl is back to show us all how absurd and fun language can be when homophones, homonyms, and tricky punctuation are at play!

Breaking up used to be easy. You'd sit down, air your grievances, shed some tears, then commiserate with your friends over a pint of ice cream. But then it was over. Your ex was history. And if you lived in a big enough city, chances are you'd never bump into him or her again.    But the golden age of break-ups has come and gone. Today our exes, former friends, estranged relatives, and even that random person we met that one night in Vegas are just a thumb tap away, their lives playing out in an endless soap opera of status updates, selfies, Snapchats, and Tweets. The ways we interact with each other have changed forever. But our desire for human connection remains the same.    In  Unfriending My Ex , Kim Stolz shares her stories from the front lines of our emoji-laden, filter-heavy, ultra-connected world, capturing the hilarity and chaos of life both online and off. Whether you've spent two hours clicking through a semi-stranger's vacation pictures or accidentally swiped right on a former flame, Kim Stolz is here to tell you you're not alone, you're not crazy, and she'd like a few of those french fries that you Instagrammed at dinner. Smart, honest, and always relatable,  Unfriending My Ex  is a must read for anyone who likes to hold a book in one hand and their phone in the other. "

In this universally accessible New York Times bestseller named for her wildly popular web series, Issa Rae&#8212;\"a singular voice with the verve and vivacity of uncorked champagne\" (Kirkus Reviews)&#8212;waxes humorously on what it's like to be unabashedly awkward in a world that regards introverts as hapless misfits and black as cool.I'm awkward&#8212;and black. Someone once told me those were the two worst things anyone could be. That someone was right. Where do I start? Being an introvert (as well as \"funny,\" according to the Los Angeles Times) in a world that glorifies cool isn't easy. But when Issa Rae, the creator of the Shorty Award-winning hit series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, is that introvert&#8212;whether she's navigating love, the workplace, friendships, or \"rapping\"&#8212;it sure is entertaining. Now, in this New York Times bestselling debut collection written in her witty and self-deprecating voice, Rae covers everything from cybersexing in the early days of the Internet to deflecting unsolicited comments on weight gain, from navigating the perils of eating out alone and public displays of affection to learning to accept yourself&#8212;natural hair and all. The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl is a book no one&#8212;awkward or cool, black, white, or other&#8212;will want to miss. "

He attended magnet schools and selective academic programs and was on track to realize his potential. But those dreams were derailed when, much to his Mami's dismay, he followed a girlfriend to Minnesota and a dead-end job. Languishing and unable to get it together, Stephen eventually moved back home. Broke and eager to make a way for himself\u2014and away from the oppressively religious father wreaking havoc on his love life\u2014the affable, easy going, and quick-witted Stephen lands a much-coveted job as a doorman at a high-end building on Park Avenue.  Hilarity and drama soon abound as Stephen learns the dos and don'ts of being a doorman for the rich and famous and witnesses the antics going on behind the front entrance of this swanky building. In Building Material, he shares those entertaining tales and introduces an unforgettable cast of characters\u2014from Puerto Rican and Albanian doormen battling it out for turf to quirky one percenters to slimy sugar daddies to his peers, both friends and frenemies. Throughout, Stephen offers a glimpse into the unfathomable lives of the residents and a sharp portrait of an everyday man wanting more for himself.  Both poignant and laugh-out-loud funny, Building Material is a captivating true tale of class, failure, and redemption\u2014and how to come back swinging\u2014from a gifted young talent. "

                "If you or someone you know has just turned fifty, it's time to accept that the rules of life have changed, and that fifty is  not  the new thirty for most of us. Leland Gregory understands the forgetful minds, sagging bodies, and flagging pride of his fellow middle-agers, and in  50 Things Not to Do after 50 , he offers helpful advice aimed at combating the humiliations this stage of life can bring. For example, regardless of your gender, under no circumstances should you ever attempt to wear leather pants start a story that involves a lot of names\u2014you'll forget most of them before the story is over stalk your high school sweetheart on Facebook. You might discover the person you had the hots for in 10th grade isn't so hot anymore get drunk in Pamplona and deciding to run with the bulls volunteer to be a drug mule Say things like \"fo'shizzle,\" \"whatev,\" or \"cray-cray\" And do we really need to mention thongs, Speedos, or jeggings?  50 Things Not to Do after 50  is a lighthearted and sometimes painfully on-target book about how what we used to do in our twenties, thirties, and forties should be avoided at all costs now that we're in our fifties.

                "'Shocking, timely and - as you'd expect from Danny Wallace - very funny'  - Adam Kay  'Thrilling, thought-provoking, funny and wise. Danny has an incredible knack for taking the bizarre fringes and rabbit holes of humanity and making them compulsively laugh-out-loud readable.'  - Danny Robins, journalist, presenter of Uncanny and writer of 2:22 A Ghost Story  'Danny Wallace lightens this dark topic about lies and propaganda with his trademark humour and gets the balance just right'  \u2013 BBC, Books to Read in 2024  Have you been keeping your eye on your grandma lately? Have you been calling her enough? You sure she's not spending too much time on YouTube? Is she talking fondly of dictators? Has she suddenly started quietly muttering in the Aldi queue about the \"Jewish Space Lasers\" she's heard are setting wildfires around the world to make sure everyone believes in climate change? When was the moment the world began to believe anything?  Danny Wallace, million-copy bestselling author of  Yes Man  and  Join Me , has fallen down the modern rabbit hole of lies, conspiracies and disinformation. Along the way, he encounters families torn apart by accusations and fake news, journalists putting themselves on the frontline of the disinformation war, reformed conspiracy theorists, influencers who see profit in stoking paranoia, and the shadowy nameless, faceless trolls on the other side of our screens. He discovers how disinformation and well-told lies can ruin a year or a whole life, how they can affect our family, our street, our community. How they can spread across a country, a continent, even the world. How they take hold of our imaginations and make us feel both helpless and powerful. And Danny asks: can you do anything to stop it \u2013 even with the truth on your side?. "

I loved this and you will, too.\u201d\u2014Mindy Kaling, author of  Why Not Me?  and  Nothing Like I Imagined   What to do when you\u2019re the perpetual new kid, only child, and military brat hustling school to school each year and everyone\u2019s looking to you for answers? Make some shit up, of course!\u00a0And a young Jay Ellis does just that, with help from his imaginary friend, Mikey. A testament to the importance of invention, trusting oneself, and making space for creativity,  Did Everyone Have an Imaginary Friend (or Just Me)?  is a memoir of a kid who confided in his imaginary sidekick to navigate parallel pop culture universes (like watching  Fresh Prince  alongside John Hughes movies or listening to Ja Rule and Dave Matthews) to a lifetime of birthday disappointment (being a Christmas-season Capricorn will do that to you) and hoop dreams gone bad. Mikey also guides Ellis through tragedies, like losing his teenage cousin in a mistaken-target drive-by and the shame and fear of being pulled over by cops almost a dozen times the year he got his driver\u2019s license. As his imaginary friend morphs into adult consciousness,\u00a0Ellis charts an unforgettable story of looking inward to solve to some of life\u2019s biggest (and smallest) challenges, told in the roast-you-with-love voice of your closest homey.

In fact, they're pretty amazing, and with their humongous families, they might turn your picnic into a party!  Nothing can ruin a picnic faster than a bunch of ants. It's a good thing there are no ants in this book . . . well, maybe there's only one. Or two. . . . Or ten?? Maybe it's not so bad. Ants are kind of cool, after all \u2014 especially the ones with amazing butts, like the Acrobat Ant that waves its back end around to scare off enemies. Or the Slender Leaf Ant that can glide through the air. Or the Dinosaur Ant, which is the biggest ant in the world! Okay, so a picnic with ants is actually lots of fun! But what if an anteater also wants to join the picnic?. "

                "\"It's a hilarious essay collection about trauma. Yes, really.\"\u2014People Magazine    From award-winning actor and comedian Paul Scheer, a candid and hilarious memoir-in-essays on coming to terms with childhood trauma and finding the joy in embracing your authentic self.   Paul Scheer has entertained countless fans and podcast listeners with stories about the odd, wild, and absurd details of his life. Yet these tales have pointed to deeper, more difficult truths that the actor and comedian has kept to himself. Now, he is finally ready to share those truths for the first time\u2014but, of course, with a healthy dose of humor.  Blending the confident, affable voice that has won him a dedicated following with a refreshing level of candor, Joyful Recollections of Trauma chronicles Paul's often shocking, admittedly tumultuous childhood and how the experiences of his youth have reverberated throughout his life. In his comedy, Paul has always been unafraid to \"go there,\" to play na\u00efve, cringeworthy characters, imbuing them with disarming charm and humanity. That daring openness is on display in the pages of this memoir, but in true Paul fashion, it is also surprising, eye-opening, and side-splitting.  In this madcap journey through the inner working of his mind and creative process, Paul Scheer demonstrates once again that the truth is often stranger\u2014and funnier\u2014than fiction. Joyful Recollections of Trauma offers a unique perspective on universal themes: growing up, working through a challenging childhood, staying true to yourself, and finding success, fulfillment, and happiness in often strange and difficult circumstances. Throughout, Paul shares both the hard-fought lessons and the laughter that can be found in the darkest parts of life, and reminds us that what matters is not what you've been through but who you are becoming. If you loved recent memoirs by Molly Shannon, Maria Bamford, RuPaul, and Jennette McCurdy\u2014or any book that moves you to both laughter and tears\u2014Joyful Recollections of Trauma is the perfect read for you.

The cynical, educated, three-steaks-a-week, house-in-the-Hamptons representatives of the Ayn Rand in all of us generate the jokes that get faxed nationwide. That's the myth, and this is the confirmation of it. Compiled by four anonymous Wall Streeters, here are the jokes that are sure to come in handy for any commuter, socially challenged business person, or new guy/gal at the water fountain. Slim enough to fit in your shirt pocket,  The Wall Street Joke Book  can be toted with you for those moments that call for a real-man's guffaw.

                "The true story of the greatest conspiracy in US history-and how to fight back.   Have you ever seen a baby pigeon? You haven't, have you? No one has, not in many, many years. They used to be everywhere. You couldn't walk out of your front door in New York City in the 1930s without seeing dozens of those little guys scurrying around. Today, there are millions of grown up pigeons in New York, but not a baby pigeon to be seen. That's because they come out of the factory as adults. This is one of the many smoking guns of the bird drone surveillance crisis. Since 1959, the Deep State has mercilessly slaughtered over 12 billion birds and replaced them with identical drones that are designed to spy on private citizens and report their every action directly to the government. From pet canaries to  Sesame Street , the shadowy figures that pull the strings have infiltrated every aspect of our society, making a mockery of civil liberties while the American people live in blissful ignorance. Until now. In  Birds Aren't Real , whistleblowers Peter McIndoe and Connor Gaydos trace the roots of a political conspiracy so vast and well-hidden that it almost seems like an elaborate hoax. These hero Bird Truthers have risked life and limb to compile and disseminate a treasure trove of information about the origins of the surveillance crisis, its spread, and the patriots who are on the front lines today, raising awareness and working to reclaim America as the land of the free. This urgent manifesto features a host of useful illustrations, activities, and leaked classified documents that will convince even the most outspoken skeptic that birds aren't real. The truth is out there: will you stand and fight before it's too late?. "

But only one person has made it to the finalists' round an astounding fifteen times and won eight contests: Lawrence Wood, also known as the Ken Jennings of caption writing. What's Wood's secret? What makes a caption good or bad? How do you beat the crowd? And most important, what makes a caption  funny ? Packed with 175 of the magazine's best cartoons and featuring a foreword by Bob Mankoff, former cartoon editor of  The New Yorker  and creator of the caption contest,  Your Caption Has Been Selected  takes you behind the scenes to learn about the contest's history, the way it's judged, and what it has to say about humor, creativity, and good writing. Lawrence reveals his own captioning process and shows readers how to generate the perfect string of words to get a laugh. Informative, funny, and just a little vulgar, this book will delight anyone who doesn't have a personal vendetta against the author. "

                "An adoring, celebratory tribute to the one, the only, Jennifer Coolidge, that all-at-once captures her unique personality, engaging life story, smart and sassy life lessons, and special brand of humor that's quickly made JC one of America's most beloved stars and pop culture icons.   Whether we remember Jennifer Coolidge as the hilariously ditzy manicurist Paulette Bonafont\u00e9 in  Legally Blonde , as the seductress Stifler\u2019s Mom from  American Pie , or as the totally unaware and fragile basket case Tanya McQuoid in  The White Lotus , these scene-stealing performances have shown her many dimensions as a comic actor and her craft is palpable\u2014Jennifer has finally reached the pop culture stardom she so rightly deserves.\u00a0  To say the comedy legend is having a comeback would be an understatement. Jennifer has been well known to her fans for decades since her performances in  American Pie ,  Legally Blonde , and numerous appearances in Christopher Guest mockumentaries ( Best in Show ,  A Mighty Wind ), but it was her recent roles in  The White Lotus  and  The Watcher  that made people stand up and take notice of this hilarious actor and all-around amazing talent. Her fearless and entertaining characters have earned her an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a Critics' Choice Award, and she has been lovingly parodied by Chloe Fineman in two  SNL  sketches.  I Heart Jennifer Coolidge  is a loving tribute to an incredible icon that recounts Jennifer\u2019s engaging life story, her numerous roles, guest star appearances, small screen success stories, and, of course, sage wisdom and sassy advice we can all learn from this iconic actor. It\u2019s a lively, illustrated love letter to JC that\u2019s part biography, part words of wisdom, part life lessons, that highlights this national treasure with confidence, personality, and all the humor.

We live on a planet infested with humans. They are a pernicious species, yet undeniably clever and capable\u2014even if the reasons behind their actions are often incomprehensible to us felines.  But while it is true that there have never been so many primates on Earth, in reality, they are quite simple to teach using well-practiced domestication techniques, such as loud vocalizations, strategic nighttime alarms, and selective displays of affection.  And if you choose your specimen carefully, you'll find that it can be completely tamed, and you'll end up with the best, most faithful companion you could possibly wish for.  Andrea Ferolla's elegant illustrations make this helpful guide a feast of fancies for the eyes\u2014the perfect gift for the cat lover in your life.  Translated from the Italian by Katherine Gregor.

J. Perelman\u2019s \u201cCloudland Revisited\u201d series: 22 reviews of once-popular books and silent films whose expiration dates had passed. All but forgotten even at the time, they were nonetheless part of Perelman\u2019s youth and made an indelible mark on him. In the comic genius\u2019s biting satire they live once again:  Gertrude Atherton\u2019s sensationalist fantasy\u202f Black Oxen   Sax Rohmer\u2019s supervillain blockbuster\u202f The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu   the \u201cunderwater\u201d silent film adaptation of\u202f Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea   Edgar Rice Burrough\u2019s 1914 novel  Tarzan of the Apes   and George Barr McCutcheon\u2019s 1901 historical fantasy novel  Graustark \u2014the  Game of Thrones  of its era\u2014which launched numerous sequels and film adaptations\u00a0  The complete series is collected here for the first time. With self-deprecating humor and frequent embarrassment, Perelman reflects on how rereading and rewatching brings us in contact with how we, like an old book or film, have both changed and remained the same. This paperback includes a tribute to Perelman\u2019s art by another beloved  New Yorker  writer, Adam Gopnik. "

Trust me.\u201d He would occasionally share them with his classes, who enjoyed them as much as he did, and so this book was born.  Best in Class  collects nearly 200 of the most entertaining of these moments culled from real student writing and complements them with dozens of playful illustrations to create a sympathetically hilarious book for anyone who has muddled their way through the wilderness of a school writing assignment.  \u00a0  Funny and strange moments from twenty-five years of student writing captured in 200 pieces of essential wisdom.

                "The innovative James Beard Award\u2013winning podcaster who changed the way you think about pasta shapes with his invention of the viral sensation cascatelli now does the same for pasta sauces in this fun and charmingly obsessive cookbook, which includes a foreword from bestselling author J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt.   When Sporkful podcast host Dan Pashman launched cascatelli, a new pasta shape he invented that he designed to hold tons of sauce, stay on the fork, and be incredibly satisfying to bite into, it went viral and was named one of TIME Magazine's Best Inventions of the Year. VICE called him \"a modern pasta legend.\"  But as Dan was flooded with pictures of what people were making with his pasta, he was disappointed to see how limited the dishes were: tomato sauce, meat sauce, mac and cheese, over and over. A few party animals made pesto.  So Dan set out to revolutionize people's conceptions of pasta sauces, just as he did with pasta shapes. He traveled across Italy and worked with an all-star team of recipe developers in the US to create a new kind of pasta sauce cookbook for people bored with the old standbys. That's why there's no 3-hour marinara recipe or fresh pasta made from scratch in this book. No photos of nonnas caked in flour or the hills of Tuscany. Instead it's time to show the world\u2014Anything's Pastable.  Here you'll enjoy dishes inspired by a range of ingredients and cuisines:  Kimchi Carbonara  Cacio e Pepe e Chili Crisp  Keema Bolognese  Mapo Tofu Cascatelli  Shakshuka and Shells  Smoked Cheddar and Chicken Manicotti \"Enchiladas\"  Linguine with Miso Clam Sauce  Shrimp and Andouille Mac and Cheese   Lesser-known Italian pasta dishes with a twist:  Spaghetti all'Assassina (spicy pasta pan fried until charred and crispy crunchy)  Ciceri e Tria (chewy fresh pasta with crispy fried pasta in a light chickpea broth)  Cavatelli with Roasted Artichokes and Preserved Lemon  Creste di Gallo with Fava Beans and Dandelion Greens  Pasta Frittata   Fun and delicious concoctions that may\u2014or may not\u2014be how they do it in Italy:  Spinach Artichoke Dip Lasagna Pinwheels  Pasta Pizza (the \"crust\" is fettucine fused together)  Roman Cafeteria Hot Dog Pasta Salad with Canned Veggies   With an incredible array of recipes, Dan showcases the limitless pastabilities when you really know how to use your noodle.

And that's where Michael Arceneaux sits, and that's what he does in this new book. It's like he's crawling around inside your head opening file cabinets and telling you what the gibberish you've scribbled on each page in each file means. What a great, fun read.\"\u2014  Shea Serrano, #1 New York Times bestselling author    New York Times bestselling author Michael Arceneaux returns with a hilarious collection of essays about making your voice heard in an increasingly noisy and chaotic world.   In his books I Can't Date Jesus and I Don't Want to Die Poor, Michael Arceneaux established himself as one of the most beloved and entertaining writers of his generation, touching upon such hot-button topics as race, class, sexuality, labor, debt, and, of course, paying homage to the power and wisdom of Beyonc\u00e9. In this collection, Arceneaux takes stock of how far he has traveled\u2014and how much ground he still has to cover in this patriarchal, heteronormative society. He explores the opportunities afforded to Black creatives but also the doors that remain shut or ever-so-slightly ajar; the confounding challenges of dating in a time when social media has made everything both more accessible and more unreliable; and the allure of returning home while still pushing yourself to seek opportunity elsewhere.  I Finally Bought Some Jordans is both a corrective to, and a balm for, these troubling times, revealing a sharply funny and keen-eyed storyteller working at the height of his craft. "

                "Throughout personal essays spiked with humor and natural science, archaeologist R. E. Burrillo widens his range beyond his popular  Behind the Bears Ears.     After an upstate New York childhood and a bartending stint in New Orleans' French Quarter, seasonal resort work led R. E. Burrillo to the desert Southwest, whose redrock landscapes were a source of stability through mental and physical illness. In  The Backwoods of Everywhere , archaeologist Burrillo excavates his past, examining Indigenous and tourist cultures, the complexities of American archaeology, and what it means to be a local. From the ancient canal systems of Phoenix, Arizona, to the modern Mayan communities of the Yucatan Peninsula, to the depths of the Grand Canyon, Burrillo brings readers on an entertaining romp chock-full of history, ecology, cultural preservation, and personal stories.   In the vein of Bill Bryson, Tim Cahill, and Ellen Meloy, Burrillo's is a fresh voice in humor-spiked nature writing and cultural commentary. Running throughout the wide-ranging topics of  The Backwoods of Everywhere  are themes of place and locality, and how these vary between cultures and individuals. Marrying the intensely personal with the complex and technical, Burrillo's candid voice brings humor, wonder, irony, and wit to each thought-provoking essay. "

Because we're done staying silent, anxious, and ashamed about our money. It's time to join the party and finally learn about all the financial stuff that always felt too confusing. Stuff like:   How to actually budget, save, and invest (but also make it fun)   How our traumas shape our most toxic money habits, and how to create new patterns  How to build wealth in a system designed to keep us broke   How to use money to fund our biggest dreams\u2014and change the world   No more keeping our money on mute. It's time to grab the mic. "

                "A Most Anticipated Book of 2024: Elle, The Millions, LitHub, Nylon, BookPage, PureWow, and more    From the national bestselling novelist and essayist, a groundbreaking collection of brand-new pieces about the role of cultural criticism in our ever-changing world.   In her writing for Harper's, the London Review of Books, The New Yorker, and elsewhere, Lauren Oyler has emerged as one of the most trenchant and influential critics of her generation, a talent whose judgments on works of literature\u2014whether celebratory or scarily harsh\u2014have become notorious. But what is the significance of being a critic and consumer of media in today's fraught environment? How do we understand ourselves, and each other, as space between the individual and the world seems to get smaller and smaller, and our opinions on books and movies seem to represent something essential about our souls? And to put it bluntly, why should you care what she\u2014or anyone\u2014thinks?  In this, her first collection of essays, Oyler writes with about topics like the role of gossip in our exponentially communicative society, the rise and proliferation of autofiction, why we're all so \"vulnerable\" these days, and her own anxiety. In her singular prose\u2014sharp yet addictive, expansive yet personal\u2014she encapsulates the world we live and think in with precision and care, delivering a work of cultural criticism as only she can.  Bringing to mind the works of such iconic writers as Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, and Terry Castle, No Judgment is a testament to Lauren Oyler's inimitable wit and her quest to understand how we shape the world through culture. It is a sparkling nonfiction debut from one of today's most inventive thinkers. "

                "A hilariously-honest, heartwarming essay collection about life, love, and discovering you have ADHD at age 35   \u00a0  Despite being a published writer with a family, a gaggle of internet fans, and (most shockingly) a mortgage,\u00a0Emily Farris\u00a0could never get her sh*t together. As she saw it, disorganization was one of her countless character flaws\u2014that is until she was diagnosed with ADHD at age 35. Like many girls who go undiagnosed, Emily grew up internalizing criticisms about her impulsivity and lack of follow-through. She held onto that shame as she tried (and often failed) to fit into a world designed for neurotypical brains.  \u00a0  I'll Just Be Five More Minutes \u00a0is a personal essay collection of laugh-out-loud-funny, tear-jerking, and at times cringey true stories of Emily's experiences as a neurodivergent woman. With the newfound knowledge of her ADHD, Emily candidly reexamines her complicated relationships (including one with a celebrity stalker), her money problems, the years she spent unknowingly self-medicating, and her hyperfixations (two words: decorative baskets).\u00a0  \u00a0  A memoir-in-essays both entertaining and enlightening,  I'll Just Be Five More Minutes\u00a0 is for people with ADHD, as well as those who know and love them. This is a powerful collection of deeply relatable, wide-ranging stories about a woman's right to control her own body, about overwhelm and oversharing, about drinking too much and sleeping too little, and about being misunderstood by the people closest to you. At its heart,  I\u2019ll Just Be Five More Minutes  is about not quite fitting in and not really understanding why\u2014something we\u2019ve all felt whether we're neurodivergent or not. "

We read to encounter new worlds, to discover new recipes, to find connection across difference, or simply to pass a rainy afternoon. No matter the reason, books have the power to keep us safe, to challenge us, and perhaps most importantly, to make us more fully human. Shannon Reed, a longtime teacher, lifelong reader, and New Yorker contributor, gets it. With one simple goal in mind, she makes the case that we should read for pleasure above all else. In this whip-smart, laugh-out-loud-funny collection, Reed shares surprising stories from her life as a reader and the poignant ways in which books have impacted her students. From the varied novels she cherishes (Gone Girl, Their Eyes Were Watching God) to the ones she didn't (Tess of the d'Urbervilles), Reed takes us on a rollicking tour through the comforting world of literature, celebrating the books we love, the readers who love them, and the ways in which literature can transform us for the better.

Kate is a pop culture commentator and host of the popular millennial-focused podcast  Be There in Five . Part-funny, part-serious, Kate navigates the complicated nature of celebrating and criticizing the culture that shaped her as a woman, while arguing that great depths can come from surface-level interests. With her trademark style and vulnerability,  One In a Millennial  is sharp, hilarious, and heartwarming all at once. She tackles AOL Instant Messenger, purity culture, American Girl Dolls, going out tops, Spice Girl feminism, her feelings about millennial motherhood, and more. Kate's laugh-out-loud asides and keen observations will have you nodding your head and maybe even tearing up. "

In  Me and My Dad,  O'Neill writes from the heart about the man who inspired in him a love for the game and a determination to always play his best. O'Neill remembers the highlights of his own amazing career: the Cincinnati Reds calling him up to the majors, his first World Series, being traded to the Yankees \u2014 and taking part in their recent championship wins. He also reflects on his father's untimely death during the 1999 World Series and on the farewell tribute his fans gave him during his last game in Yankee Stadium. "

                "Gareth Carrol presents a collection of \"modern idioms\", which have become a part of our vocabulary in the past 50 years or so. In most cases, idioms such as \"raining cats and dogs\", that colour our everyday communication, are deeply rooted in culture and history. However, just like words, new idioms emerge in language, and many have entered our vocabulary through, TV, movies and the internet. These modern idioms can be dated very precisely. Jumping Sharks and Dropping Mics finds the origins of these idioms, and charts their development. "

Of all human qualities, humour is perhaps the most puzzling. In this very first history of humour, author and humourist William Hartston looks at every aspect of the evolution of humour and our attitudes towards it with a view to developing a proper Theory Of Everything Humorous. From comedy in ancient Greece and jokes in ancient Rome, to laughter in the Bible and the secret of comic delivery; from how humour changed following the American civil war, to how\u00a0Mark Twain changed written comedy in the English-speaking world, William leaves no stone unturned in his quest to understand what makes us chuckle. Besides being academically well-founded,  A History of Humour  will, unlike almost everything else written on the subject, be\u00a0both seriously humorous and humorously serious. "

                "In the New York Times best-selling book from the creator of the wildly popular webcomic xkcd, Randall Munroe gives hilarious and informative answers to important questions you probably never thought to ask.   Fans of xkcd ask Munroe a lot of strange questions. What if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humanity last? What if everyone only had one soulmate? What would happen if the moon went away? In pursuit of answers, Munroe ran computer simulations, pored over stacks of declassified military research memos, solved differential equations, and consulted with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, complemented by signature xkcd comics. (They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind, or at least a really big explosion.) Far more than a book for geeks, What If? explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much smarter for having read. "
