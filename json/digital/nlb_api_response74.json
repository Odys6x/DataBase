                "In theory, financial professionals are relatively distinct: A broker conducts transactions in securities on behalf of others; a dealer buys and sells securities for his or her own accounts; and an investment adviser provides advice to others regarding securities. Broker-dealers and investment advisers are subject to different regulatory structures. But trends in the financial services market since the early 1990s have blurred the boundaries between them. Regulatory reform requires a clearer understanding of the industry's complexities. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked RAND to conduct this study to examine the professionals' current business practices and whether investors understand differences between and relationships among them. The report describes a heterogeneous industry, with firms taking many different forms and offering a multitude of services and products and with investors failing to distinguish broker-dealers and investment advisers along regulatory lines. Despite this, investors express high levels of satisfaction with the services they receive from their own financial service providers. This satisfaction was much more frequently reported to arise from the personal attention the investor receives than from the actual financial returns arising from this relationship. "

                "\"During the last ten years the Islamic banking sector has grown rapidly, at an international level, as well as in individual jurisdictions including the UK. Islamic finance differs quite substantially from conventional banking, using very different mechanisms, and operating according to a different theory as it is based on Islamic law. Yet at the same time it is always subject to the law of the particular financial market in which it operates. This book takes a much-needed and comprehensive look at the legal and regulatory aspects which affect Islamic finance law, and examines the current UK and international banking regulatory frameworks which impact on this sector. The book examines the historical genesis of Islamic banking, looking at how it has developed in Muslim countries before going on to consider the development of Islamic banking in the UK and the legal position of Islamic banks within English law. The book explores company, contract, and some elements of tax law and traces the impact it has had on the development of Islamic banking in the UK, before going on to argue that the current legal and regulatory framework which affects the Islamic banking sector has on certain occasions had an unintended adverse impact on Islamic banking in the UK. The book also provides an overview of the Malaysian experience in relation to some of the main legal and regulatory challenges in the context of Islamic banking and finance\"--Provided by publisher.

                "Constitutional dialogue is a distinct form of institutional interaction whereby the pursuit of legislative goals can be constructively altered, but not foreclosed, by judicial input into the lawmaking process. Even though the respective constitutions of Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore do not provide for structural devices that enable the local legislatures to reverse a constitutional decision, except via a constitutional amendment, their courts can and do apply dialogic canons of interpretation that can foster a debate with the political branches of government. Dialogic review is also more politically efficacious in common law Asia as each of the three territories has been governed by the same ruling party or coalition since decolonization and will continue to be so governed for the foreseeable future. Where the judiciary operates within a constitutional system dominated by a semi-permanent party or coalition in government, the pursuit of dialogic review is also the political expedient way for courts to engage in a valuable but less confrontational colloquy with the political institutions on the requisites of a constitutional democracy. In making a case, the book draws on the history and constitutional frameworks of Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore; and explores how dialogic review can be applied to four core constitutional concerns: freedom of expression, freedom of religion, right to equality, and criminal due process rights.

                "\"During the last ten years the Islamic banking sector has grown rapidly, at an international level, as well as in individual jurisdictions including the UK. Islamic finance differs quite substantially from conventional banking, using very different mechanisms, and operating according to a different theory as it is based on Islamic law. Yet at the same time it is always subject to the law of the particular financial market in which it operates. This book takes a much-needed and comprehensive look at the legal and regulatory aspects which affect Islamic finance law, and examines the current UK and international banking regulatory frameworks which impact on this sector. The book examines the historical genesis of Islamic banking, looking at how it has developed in Muslim countries before going on to consider the development of Islamic banking in the UK and the legal position of Islamic banks within English law. The book explores company, contract, and some elements of tax law and traces the impact it has had on the development of Islamic banking in the UK, before going on to argue that the current legal and regulatory framework which affects the Islamic banking sector has on certain occasions had an unintended adverse impact on Islamic banking in the UK. The book also provides an overview of the Malaysian experience in relation to some of the main legal and regulatory challenges in the context of Islamic banking and finance\"--Provided by publisher.

                "Fair, Square & Legal is a concise, one-stop guide to what you as a manager should and shouldn't do if you want to stay clear of trouble. This revised edition has been thoroughly updated throughout, and provides new coverage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Written by an experienced manager, the book translates complex legal issues and precedents into a set of easy-to-follow guidelines for managing people. It provides both an overview of safe managerial procedures and a quick look-up source for specific situations you may encounter. The book encompasses a broad range of potential problem areas. For each, author Donald H. Weiss supplies non-legalese definitions of key terms, practical guidelines for what to say and do, fictionalized stories that illustrate both problems and solutions, and actual case studies of precedent-setting court decisions.

                "\"Challenging the Secular State examines Muslim efforts to incorporate shari'a (religious law) into modern Indonesia's legal system from the time of independence in 1945 to the present. The author argues that attempts to formally implement shari'a in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim state, have always been marked by tensions between the political aspirations of proponents and opponents of shari'a and by resistance from the national government. As a result, although pro-shari'a movements have made significant progress in recent years, shari'a remains tightly confined within Indonesia's secular legal system. The author first places developments in Indonesia within a broad historical and geographic context, offering a provocative analysis of the Ottoman empire's millet system and thoughtful comparisons of different approaches to pro-shari'a movements in other Muslim countries (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan). He then describes early aspirations for the formal implementation of shari'a in Indonesia in the context of modern understandings of religious law as conflicting with the idea of the nation-state.\"--Jacket.

                "\"This volume analyzes whether China's thirty years of legal reform have taken root in Chinese society by examining how ordinary citizens are using the legal system in contemporary China. It is an interdisciplinary look at law in action and at legal institutions from the bottom up, that is, beginning with those at the ground level that are using and working in the legal system. It explores the emergent Chinese conception of justice - one that seeks to balance Chinese tradition, socialist legacies, and the needs of the global market. Given the political dimension of dispute resolution in creating, settling, and changing social norms, this volume contributes to a greater understanding of political and social change in China today and of the process of legal reform generally\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "Fair, Square & Legal is a concise, one-stop guide to what you as a manager should and shouldn't do if you want to stay clear of trouble. This revised edition has been thoroughly updated throughout, and provides new coverage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Written by an experienced manager, the book translates complex legal issues and precedents into a set of easy-to-follow guidelines for managing people. It provides both an overview of safe managerial procedures and a quick look-up source for specific situations you may encounter. The book encompasses a broad range of potential problem areas. For each, author Donald H. Weiss supplies non-legalese definitions of key terms, practical guidelines for what to say and do, fictionalized stories that illustrate both problems and solutions, and actual case studies of precedent-setting court decisions.
