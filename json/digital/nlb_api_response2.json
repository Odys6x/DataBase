                "\"Trading on Target explains the rites of passages that traders pass through in order to develop a high level of mastery. Most aspiring traders stumble or become discouraged at some point in the process. Most don't have a good overview of what success requires and, as result, are unprepared for the challenges. Author and trading coach Adrienne Toghraie identifies the rites of passages, as follows: raising adequate capital; developing market knowledge; developing a trading system; testing the system; managing the business of trading; managing the psychological pitfalls of trading; surviving market losses; surviving market change; and developing an intuitive sense of the markets. Toghraie discusses the rites of passage in the context of real traders she has counseled, and, in so doing, reveals the myriad of obstacles that prevent traders from succeeding. Many traders attempt to take shortcuts and don't do the requisite work; some are addicted to risk-taking; some fail to take responsibility for their own success and blame outside agencies for their problems. Toghraie provides insights into how traders overcame these problems achieved higher levels of performance. She explains how principles of neuro-linguistic programming can be used by traders to manage their mental states for optimal performance. Geared primarily for independent traders, the book provides a realistic and helpful overview of what it takes to succeed in trading\"-- Provided by publisher. "

The author has drawn on previous studies of Irish music and general melodic theory to describe the inner workings of a rich melodic tradition. Irish folk music, resting upon monophonic melodies which are varied and ornamented, and thus viewed from several perspectives; ethnographic and musical, insider and theoretical?to weave an integrated image of a still thriving genre. The concepts of tune family and melody type are starting points for the qualitative study of melodic change and tune relationships without recourse to simplified tune skeletons or statistics. The concept of implicit folk theory leads both to rigorous theoretical analysis and to an examination of the musicians' own words, thus creating a working model in which a particular performance is understood in a larger context. The historic and ethnographic passages convey the setting of the music and suggest the ways in which Irish musicians reflect patterns in culture and patterns in sound. "

This book explores the expression of power in a New Zealand workplace through examination of 52 everyday interactions between four women and their colleagues. The main focus of this research is the expression of three types of \"control acts\", i.e., directives, requests and advice. The women include two managers who demonstrate an interactive participative style of management. They tend to minimise rather than exert power, although their status is still evident in their speech. The study is original in its combination of a quantitative and a qualitative approach, as well as in its combination of a detailed categorisation of head acts and an analysis of context and role relationships. Through the design of the study and the methodology used, the results which are brought forward challenge earlier research both on power and control acts. The data analyzed is drawn from the Wellington Language in the Workplace Project. "

                "Annotation Whether you are an investment professional managing billions of dollars or an individual investor with a small nest egg, TrimTabs Investing shows you how to beat the major stock market averages with less risk.  This groundbreaking book begins by comparing the stock market to a casino in which the house (public companies and the insiders who run them) buys and sells shares with the players (institutional and individual investors).  TrimTabs Investing argues that stock prices are primarily a function of liquidity&mdash;the amount of shares available for purchase and the amount of money available to buy them&mdash;rather than fundamental value.  Finally, it outlines the building blocks of liquidity theory and explains how you can use them to predict the direction of the stock market.&ldquo;Charles Biderman, a savvy and battle&ndash;scarred veteran of the investment wars, has fashioned an intriguing approach to making money in the stock market that adroitly avoids both heavy&ndash;breathing speculation and the standard Wall Street practices that enable investors, big and small, to lose money in good markets as well as bad. Aimed at the sophisticated investor (which may or may not be an oxymoron), the book is written in blessedly straightforward prose and is a worthwhile read for anyone with an urge to have a fling at investing.&ndash;&ndash;Alan AbelsonBarron&rsquo;s&ldquo;Since the days of Joseph and Pharaoh, it has been axiomatic that the size of the grain harvest affects the level of grain prices; but today&rsquo;s investors have been slow to appreciate the fact that the supply of stock shares significantly determines the level of stock prices. Biderman&rsquo;s long overdue book outlines the theory and evidence behind &lsquo;Trading Float,&rsquo; the actual&mdash;and exploitable&mdash;power behind major moves in the stock market. &ndash;&ndash;Paul MontgomeryCEO and CIO of Montgomery Capital Management&ldquo;&lsquo;Trade as corporate execs do, not as they say.&rsquo; Charles Biderman has built an impressive list of hedge fund clients from this essential insight, and this book does a great job explaining exactly how retail investors can incorporate it into their investing.&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Eric ZitzewitzAssistant Professor of Economics, Stanford Graduate School of Business&ldquo;Charles Biderman is a smart thinker, clear writer&mdash;and he offers here some very interesting ideas. This book is for the little guy who enjoys reading about money and economics, even if he doesn&rsquo;t adopt the strategies offered here; and for the professional or sophisticated investor, who, to a greater or lesser degree, just might.&ndash;&ndash;Andrew Tobiasauthor of The Only Investment Guide You&prime;ll Ever Need.

                "\"Top economist Gary Shilling shows you how to prosper in the slow-growing and deflationary times that lie ahead. While many investors fear a rapid rise in inflation, author Gary Shilling, an award-winning economic forecaster, argues that the global economy is going through a long period of de-leveraging and weak growth, which makes deflation far more likely and a far greater threat to investors than inflation. Shilling explains in clear language and compelling logic why the U.S. and world economy will struggle for several more years and what investors can do to protect and grow their wealth in the difficult times ahead. The investment strategies that worked for last 25 years will not work in the next 10 years. Shilling advises readers to avoid broad exposure to stocks, real estate, and commodities and to focus on high-quality bonds, high-dividend stocks, and consumer staple and food stocks. . Written by one of today's best forecasters of economic trends-twice voted by Institutional Investor as Wall Street's top economistClearly explains what to invest in, what to avoid, and how to cope with a deflationary, slow-growth economy Demonstrates how Shilling has been consistently right about major economic trends since he began forecasting in the early 1980sFilled with in-depth insights and practical advice, this timely guide lays out a convincing case for why investors need to be prepared for a long period of weak growth and deflation-not inflation-and what you can do to prosper in the difficult times ahead\"-- Provided by publisher.

It demonstrates how the potential for making money in the world's financial markets depends critically on the ability to make decisions independently of the crowd.\"--Jacket. "
