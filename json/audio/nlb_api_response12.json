                "The original Visible Learning research concluded that one of the most important influencers of student achievement is how teachers think about learning and their own role. In  Ten Mindframes for Visible Learning , John Hattie and Klaus Zierer define the 10 behaviors or mindframes that teachers need to adopt in order to maximize student success. These include:  thinking of and evaluating your impact on students' learning;   the importance of assessment and feedback for teachers;   working collaboratively and the sense of community;   the notion that learning needs to be challenging;   engaging in dialogue and the correct balance between talking and listening;   conveying the success criteria to learners;   building positive relationships.    These powerful mindframes, which should underpin every action in schools, are founded on the principle that teachers are evaluators, change agents, learning experts, and seekers of feedback who are constantly engaged with dialogue and challenge.   This practical audiobook will show any school exactly how to implement Hattie's mindframes to maximize success. Narrated by listener favorite Brian Arens.   \u00a92018 John Hattie and Klaus Zierer. Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont. "

                "A psychologist\u2019s guide to finding your most fulfilling job yet  When we\u2019re unhappy in our jobs, we often attribute our frustration to a bad manager, boring tasks, and stressful workloads. But our dissatisfaction at work usually stems from a deeper psychological need that\u2019s not being met at work, like not getting the recognition you deserve. In  Job Therapy , Dr. Tessa West helps you figure out the real reason you\u2019re unhappy and shows you how to find a new position in which you\u2019ll thrive, whether in a different role, company, or new industry altogether. Through her research interviewing thousands of people who have recently switched jobs or undergone career changes, she found there are five common sources of career frustration:   having an  identity crisis  \u2013 does your sense of self no longer match your job?  you\u2019ve  drifted-apart  \u2013 do you no longer recognize the job you once loved?   you\u2019re  torn between places  \u2013 are you taking on too many roles at work, switching tasks too often, or stuck between two paths?  you\u2019re  the runner up  \u2013 do you always feel like you keep coming in second?   you\u2019re  the underappreciated star  \u2013 are you crushing it at work, but the people around you aren\u2019t recognizing your performance?   Dr. West will guide you through a working week audit to help identify your unique psychological stressors and use that knowledge to understand what you want your future career to look like. Presenting cutting-edge insights on networking and hiring, from Dr. West\u2019s interviews with over 1,500 professional recruiters,  Job Therapy  will help you land\u00a0your best role yet \u2013 one that guarantees happiness for years to come.  *Includes a downloadable PDF of quizzes from the book.

She worked hand-in-hand with a founder who was a lightning rod for controversy\u2014OK, for stepping in it. She grew a chaotic company (Vanity Fair called it a \"pirate ship\") housed over a dentist's office outside of Boston that published giveaway papers into a juggernaut with more than 5 billion monthly video views and 225 million followers valued at 550 million dollars. Erika Ayers Badan calls herself a \"token CEO\", the rare female employee in the highest rank of a bro-roar sports and new media culture.  She's also a massive student of work: how to do it, how to be effective at it, how to get noticed, how to crush it, how to figure out what you love and do it as a job. She's figured it out, after big marketing jobs in large traditional corporations like Microsoft and AOL, for herself; she's figured it out for friends; she figured it out for the thousands of people who listened to her Barstool podcast, \"Token CEO\" every week. And in this book, she's figuring it out for everybody else.  With the verve and motivation of books like YOU ARE A BADASS and the smart, specific ideas of titles like ATOMIC HABITS, NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR CAREER is a real playbook. It's about how work really works and how you can get work to work for you. It's about thank you notes and thankless tasks, the energy in meetings and energy vampires, how to pick a boss and how to get a boss to pick you. It's about being all in (but not bringing your whole self to work\u2014some of you is better left at home) and becoming valuable to your workplace. It's about participating\u2014with your brain, your skills, your experience, and your willingness to pitch in and offer yourself up for something you may not even know how to do yet. It's about making your own luck at work.  NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR CAREER is for first-time job seekers who think no company will ever want them, people stuck in second or third jobs who don't know how to move on to the next thing, people who have the job they thought was their brass ring but who discovered it's not all that.  Her chapter titles include:  - Do Whatever Makes You Happy and F*ck Anyone Who Says Otherwise  - Know What Your Company is Paying You to Do  - Don't Be an Asshole at Work  - The Messy Stuff: Being Human, Getting Drunk, Sex, and Other Disaster Scenarios at Work  - Feedback is a Gift.

                "Internal and external pressure continues to mount for college professionals to provide evidence of successful activities, programs, and services, which means that, going forward, nearly every campus professional will need to approach their work with a data-informed perspective. But you find yourself thinking \"I am not a data person.\" Yes, you are. Or can be with the help of Amelia Parnell. You Are a Data Person provides context for the levels at which you are currently comfortable using data, helps you identify both the areas where you should strengthen your knowledge and where you can use this knowledge in your particular university role. For example, the rising cost to deliver high-quality programs and services to students has pushed many institutions to reallocate resources to find efficiencies. In addition to programs, services, and pedagogy, professionals are constantly monitoring the rates at which students are entering, remaining enrolled in, and leaving the institution, as those movements impact the institution's financial position. From teaching professors to student affairs personnel and beyond, Parnell offers tangible examples of how professionals can make data contributions at their current and future knowledge level, and will even inspire listeners to take the initiative to engage in data projects.

                "Brought to you by Penguin.  Who and what are supercommunicators? They're the people who can steer a conversation to a successful conclusion. They are able to talk about difficult topics without giving offence. They know how to make others feel at ease and share what they think. They're brilliant facilitators and decision-guiders. How do they do it? In this groundbreaking new book, Charles Duhigg unravels the secrets of the supercommunicators to reveal the art - and the science - of successful communication. He unpicks the different types of everyday conversation and pinpoints why some go smoothly while others swiftly fall apart. He reveals the conversational questions and gambits that bring people together. And he shows how even the most tricky of encounters can be turned around. In the process, he shows why a CIA operative was able to win over a reluctant spy, how a member of a jury got his fellow jurors to view an open-and-shut case differently, and what a doctor found they needed to do to engage with a vaccine sceptic. Above all, he reveals the techniques we can all master to successfully connect with others, however tricky the circumstances. Packed with fascinating case studies and drawing on cutting-edge research, this book will change the way you think about what you say, and how you say it.  Praise for    The Power of Habit:   'Few books become essential manuals for business and living.  The Power of Habit  is an exception.'

                "The author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller Ultralearning explores why it's so difficult for people to learn new skills, arguing that three factors must be met to make advancement possible, and offering 12 maxims to improve the way we learn.   Life revolves around learning\u2014in school, at our jobs, even in the things we do for fun. Yet learning is often mysterious. Sometimes it comes fairly effortlessly: quickly finding our way around a new neighborhood or picking up the routine at a new job. In other cases, it's a slog. We may spend hours in the library, yet still not do well on an exam. We may want to switch companies, industries, or even professions, but not feel qualified to make the leap. Decades spent driving a car, typing on a computer, or hitting a tennis ball don't reliably make us much better at them. Improvement can be fickle, if it comes at all.  In Get Better At Anything, Scott Young argues that there are three key factors in helping us learn:  See\u2014Most of what we know comes from other people. The ease of learning from others determines, to a large extent, how quickly we can improve.  Do\u2014Mastery requires practice. But not just any practice will do. Our brains our fantastic effort-saving machines, which can be both a tremendous advantage and a curse.  Feedback\u2014Progress requires constant adjustment. Not just the red stroke of a teacher's pen, but the results of hands-on experience.  When we're able to learn from the example of other people, practice extensively ourselves, and get reliable feedback, rapid progress results. Yet, when one, or all, of these factors is inhibited, improvement often becomes impossible. Using research and real-life examples, Young breaks down these elements into twelve simple maxims. Whether you're a student studying for an exam, an employee facing a new skill at work, or just want to get better at something you're interested in, his insights will help you do it better.

Our eyes are now open to the dangerous fact that our technology is built by a series of big decisions made by a small number of people, mainly men. It means our technology is derived from the gender, nationality and beliefs of a section of society whose lived experience may not chime with your own. The tech world might feel beyond reach, particularly if you're a woman. But in  She's In CTRL  Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon, a dynamic advocate for women in STEM, insists that technology is not an unchangeable and unquestionable force. It is not the preserve of the elite. It is in our homes and in our hands. Rather than feeling powerless to make changes to the way tech works and fails, she argues that it's time to get into the room where the decisions are made. Or, better yet, create our own tech rooms. This powerful book about women, tech and daring to dream takes inspiration from Dr Imafidon's own experience and from the stories of other pioneers and innovators who have, against the odds, transformed technology.  She's In CTRL  is an inspirational narrative about how women must play a part in ensuring a future that's evenly distributed. \u00a9 Anne-Marie Imafidon 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin.    A powerful guide to successful, transformative entrepreneurship for the under-represented from Eric Collins, host of the award-winning Channel 4 reality business show  The Money Maker.   At a time when half of Black households in the UK live in persistent poverty - over twice as many as their white counterparts -  We   Don't Need Permission  argues that investing in Black and under-represented entrepreneurs in order to create successful businesses is the surest, fastest socio-economic game-changer there is. Durable empowerment - from education to health outcomes - is key to solving the multiple problems that result from systemic racism and sexism. And it is the best way to close the inequality gaps that have hampered and continue to hinder Black people and all women too. To address this problem head on, Eric Collins co-founded venture capital firm Impact X Capital to invest in under-represented entrepreneurs in the UK and Europe. In  We Don't Need Permission , Collins identifies ten key principles of successful entrepreneurship, and reveals how it's possible to change a system that has helped some, while holding others back. The book not only aims to inspire and motivate under-represented people to take their future and economic destiny into their own hands, but will demand of current business leaders and organizations that they do business better. It's time to stop waiting for someone else to give permission, Collins tells us, and start boldly making the world we want to see.  'Eric Collins is one of the most powerful business people in Britain.'  The Times   \u00a9 Eric Collins 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022. "

                "Based on his highly popular Columbia Business School course \"Personal Leadership & Success\", Dr. Hitendra Wadhwa shares key principles for how to pursue success by letting your true self shine through in everything you do.  In our pursuit of success, we often struggle to balance the world's demands with our own dreams. Some of us pursue Outer Success, wanting to be liked and loved, supported and promoted. But in our quest for worldly glory, we may ignore the subtle stirring of our spirit, waking up one day to realize just how far we have drifted from our personal ideals. Others among us seek Inner Success, wanting the freedom to pursue our own calling. But in our quest to be true to ourselves, we may end up hurting, disappointing, or antagonizing others, straining relationships and being sidelined. It seems that our drives for Outer and Inner Success are destined to clash. But perhaps that's only because we've been searching for success in the wrong places. We can pursue from the place where our greatest potential is held, our Inner Core, by activating Five Core Energies:  Purpose ,  Wisdom ,  Growth ,  Love , and  Self-Realization . Through extensive scientific research and masterful storytelling about exemplary figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, Mother Theresa, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Nelson Mandela\u2014and everyday heroes drawn from Dr. Hitendra Wadhwa's class at Columbia Business School and client workshops at Mentora Institute\u2014readers arrive at timeless principles of success in life and leadership. Empowered by your Five Core Energies, you discover how to create outer impact from a place of inner mastery. With a PhD in Management Science from MIT and a lifelong study of the world's mystic traditions, Wadhwa brings a mathematician's rigor and a truth-seeker's spirit to some of today's most vexing questions about authenticity, success, leadership, and human potential. This book shows how by activating your Inner Core and expressing it in everything you do, you create the conditions where Inner Success and Outer Success can flourish in mutual harmony. "

At a time when many long-held workplace structures and beliefs are changing,  Career Forward  is a beacon for women aspiring to achieve success and satisfaction in rewarding careers. Drawing on decades of experience reaching the top of Fortune 500 companies, Grace Puma and Christiana Smith Shi show women how to maximize their career journeys, get paid what they're worth, navigate the shifts that occur in any company, build a leadership identity, and have a full life in and out of work.   The authors challenge negative stereotypes about female ambition, and urge women to be bold, follow their dreams, and seize the chance to lead \"big\" lives. The secret is to focus on career first, job second. Instead of chasing a better job title or a salary bump, the goal should be a long-range career path that leads to success. \"Career forward\" means keeping a focus on the future and recognizing that being good at your job is often not enough\u2014that you should take every opportunity to boost your connections, take on \"difficult\" assignments, and work actively to broaden your skills.   Packed with personal anecdotes and wisdom from women who've been there, and featuring quizzes and checklists for self-evaluation,  Career Forward  provides a wealth of valuable lessons, including the value of thinking of yourself as a \"growth stock\" and, instead of chasing the elusive work-life balance, living a well-rounded 360-degree life that fully embraces both. Offering a refreshing response to anyone who wonders whether working hard is really worth it, Puma and Smith Shi's emphatic answer is \"yes,\" because by correctly following the blueprint in  Career Forward , the rewards will far outweigh the effort.

                "\"A must-read for seasoned and new managers alike.\"  \u2014 Johnny C. Taylor Jr., SHRM-SCP, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)    A groundbreaking guide to mastering the job interview, offering proven advice and techniques to discover your unique interview style that is key to interviewing better\u2014for those on either side of the table.   Conventional interviewing advice doesn't work. That's what Anna Papalia learned through years of experience as an HR professional, consultant for Fortune 500 companies, and teacher at the Fox School of Business. None of the existing tools work for one simple reason: they don't get to the heart of what actually makes a great interview\u2014self-awareness. At its core, an interview is a set of questions about you. If you don't know yourself, you won't do well.  Determined to make the process better, more inclusive, and less obscure, Anna spent years researching how people interview and uncovered a new science to interviewing, rooted in the finding that there are four main styles people exhibit in an interview: you can be a Charmer, a Challenger, an Examiner, or a Harmonizer. Your style influences how you view and approach interviews, and ultimately how you perform in them. In Interviewology, Anna teaches you how to identify your individual style (and that of who you are interviewing with) and offers pragmatic tips for using this knowledge to nail your next interview.  Packed with wisdom, Interviewology offers clarity and a dynamic, scientifically validated approach that challenges everything you thought you knew about interviewing, providing unique insight into the process, debunking some of the most common myths, and explaining how you can perform better, whether you're applying for the job or looking for the right candidate.  Going beyond generic advice that isn't useful in the real world\u2014such as memorizing rote answers or strict guidelines\u2014Interviewology is a revolutionary approach that focuses on self-awareness\u2014and how to develop it\u2014to help everyone master their own unique interview style. It's about the power of knowing yourself and how that insight can lead to a more successful career and life.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin.    The bestselling business classic on the power of relationships, updated with in-depth advice for making connections in the digital world  Do you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to success? Master networker Keith Ferrazzi says the secret is in reaching out to others. As he discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people is the way they use the power of relationships - so that everyone wins.  Never Eat Alone: Expanded and Updated  lays out the steps and mindset Ferrazzi uses to connect with thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates: people he has helped and who have helped him. This form of connecting to the world is based on generosity; Ferrazzi distinguishes gen\u00aduine relationship-building from crude glad-handing. These practical, proven principles include:  don't keep score  (make sure other people get what they want, too); ' ping' constantly  (reach out to your contacts all the time - not just when you need something);  never eat alone  ('invisibility' is a fate worse than failure); and become the  'king of content'  (use social media to make meaningful connections). In this classic, global bestseller you'll discover the timeless strategies used by the world's most connected people, from Bill Clinton to the Dalai Lama. And you'll learn how to transform your own network, career and life.  'A step-by-step way to build relationships with anyone. The tone is engaging and the advice practical'  New York Times  'Cleverly mixes anecdotes with cogent advice and suggests concrete steps readers can take toward improvement'  USA Today  'Don't walk . . .

                "Year after year, readers pulled me aside at events and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never had a problem starting. I\u2019ve started a million things, but I never finish them. Why can\u2019t I finish?   According to studies, 92 percent of New Year\u2019s resolutions fail. You\u2019ve practically got a better shot at getting into Juilliard to become a ballerina than you do at finishing your goals.  For years, I thought my problem was that I didn\u2019t try hard enough. So I started getting up earlier. I drank enough energy drinks to kill a horse. I hired a life coach and ate more superfoods. Nothing worked, although I did develop a pretty nice eyelid tremor from all the caffeine. It was like my eye was waving at you, very, very quickly.   Then, while leading a thirty-day online course to help people work on their goals, I learned something surprising: The most effective exercises were not those that pushed people to work harder. The ones that got people to the finish line did just the opposite\u2014 they took the pressure off.   Why? Because the sneakiest obstacle to meeting your goals is not laziness, but perfectionism. We\u2019re our own worst critics, and if it looks like we\u2019re not going to do something right, we prefer not to do it at all. That\u2019s why we\u2019re most likely to quit on day two, \u201cthe day after perfect\u201d\u2014when our results almost always underper\u00adform our aspirations.   The strategies in this book are counterintuitive and might feel like cheating. But they\u2019re based on studies conducted by a university researcher with hundreds of participants. You might not guess that having more fun, eliminating your secret rules, and choosing something to bomb intentionally works. But the data says otherwise. People who have fun are 43 percent more successful! Imagine if your diet, guitar playing, or small business was 43 percent more suc\u00adcessful just by following a few simple principles.   If you\u2019re tired of being a chronic starter and want to become a consistent finisher, you have two options: You can continue to beat yourself up and try harder, since this time that will work. Or you can give yourself the gift of done. "

                "This audiobook narrated by Nancy Crane traces women's journey to close the gender wage gap and sheds new light on the continued struggle to achieve equity between couples at home  A century ago, it was a given that a woman with a college degree had to choose between having a career and a family. Today, there are more female college graduates than ever before, and more women want to have a career and family, yet challenges persist at work and at home. This book traces how generations of women have responded to the problem of balancing career and family as the twentieth century experienced a sea change in gender equality, revealing why true equity for dual career couples remains frustratingly out of reach. Drawing on decades of her own groundbreaking research, Claudia Goldin provides a fresh, in-depth look at the diverse experiences of college-educated women from the 1900s to today, examining the aspirations they formed\u2014and the barriers they faced\u2014in terms of career, job, marriage, and children. She shows how many professions are \"greedy,\" paying disproportionately more for long hours and weekend work, and how this perpetuates disparities between women and men. Goldin demonstrates how the era of COVID-19 has severely hindered women's advancement, yet how the growth of remote and flexible work may be the pandemic's silver lining. Antidiscrimination laws and unbiased managers, while valuable, are not enough.  Career and Family  explains why we must make fundamental changes to the way we work and how we value caregiving if we are ever to achieve gender equality and couple equity. "

The more irresistible you are as a leader, the more pull you have for employees to want to stay and for your customers to remain loyal. In The Magnetic Leader, Roberta Matuson asks us to consider that the quality of a company's leadership is the most important factor in attracting and retaining high-quality employees. Matuson has spent 20 years helping organizations achieve both market leadership and dynamic growth by maximizing the talent they already have, in addition to creating a magnetic environment that attracts high-caliber new hires. Many are searching for a magical formula, but the fact is that the answer lies inside businesses' organizations. Instead of offering crazy perks, companies need to focus on the one perk they can't get anywhere else, which is the opportunity to work with a truly magnetic leader. The Magnetic Leader aids listeners in transforming their leadership style from push to pull, repel to attract, dismal to good, and then good to great. They'll become magnetic leaders who attract the cream of the crop and ultimately create legions of loyal, talented superstars eager to beat the competition. "

Business journalist Kamal Ahmed and start-up supremo Rohan Silva lift the lid on the realities of starting your own business in a series of candid, unfiltered interviews with innovators who have changed our world. We hear the unvarnished truth about their successes, failures, and the challenges they faced on the way to realising their vision. From fearless company founders to visionary CEOs, each has a fascinating story to tell. There's Julie Deane, who went from starting The Cambridge Satchel Company at the kitchen table with \u00a3600 to selling 10,000 bags a month; Tony Kitous, who arrived in London from Algeria with nothing and ended up with a chain of 25 Comptoir Libanais restaurants; and Temie Giwa-Tubosun, creator of LifeBank, which works to improve access to essential medical supplies in Africa and has saved over 7000 lives. They're joined by a wealth of other inspiring disrupters to share their hard-earned wisdom, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, lastminute.com founders Martha Lane Fox and Brent Hoberman, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Mumsnet's Justine Roberts and Sir James Dyson. Among the lessons they've learned are knowing when to cut your losses, how to change direction without giving up on an idea, the dangers of over-idealism and self-delusion and the importance of patience, persistence and passion. The advice they give - about managing relationships, maintaining self-belief and not being afraid to make mistakes - is invaluable for everyone, not just entrepreneurs, and will help you to succeed both in business and in life.

The audiobook includes a PDF of the sketches found in the book \u2014 composed in a way that differs from Jerry's intention but still captures his goal.  Jerry Pinkney drew everywhere, all the time. It was how he made sense of the world\u2014how he coped with the stress of being a sensitive child growing up in crowded spaces, struggling with a learning disability, in a time when the segregation of Black Americans was the norm. Only drawing could offer him a sense of calm, control, and confidence. When friends and siblings teased him about having the nickname \"Jerry\" as his only name, his mother always said, \"Just 'Jerry' is enough. He'll make something of that name someday.\" And so he did, eventually becoming one of the most celebrated children's book illustrators of all time and paving the way for countless other Black artists.

Hence, we wouldn't be taking your candidature forward for this position.'   When Issac quit his dream job of Head of Marketing at PUMA in 2015 and took a career break to study screenwriting in New York, little did he know what he had signed up for.  Over the next eighteen months, he would face over a hundred rejections from famed brands, headhunters, publishers, talent agencies and producers. After being rejected in the final interview rounds of brands like Uber, Netflix and Airbnb, he slowly and steadily clawed his way back into a mainstream career. Issac went on to lead a team of over a hundred people at Discovery, having built their direct-to-consumer OTT business in Asia-Pacific (discovery+), and has authored two books - all in a span of five years since that career break.  Over the past two years, Issac spoke to more than fifty working professionals, all of whom went through a break in their career for various reasons. Reboot is an intimate, honest and rich compendium of all those experiences, mistakes, lows and highs that people confronted with a career break go through. It shares the message that no matter the odds you are up against, a career break is always temporary, and, in many cases, it can even prove to be life-changing. "

                "Disruption happens every day across the corporate world. As employees, we experience reorgs, layoffs and acquisitions, and as disrupters ourselves we move cross country, chase ideas and challenge norms. But amidst all the disruption, some of us seem to thrive in times of turmoil. These are the communicators who have mastered the two skills hidden within corporate disruption: learning how to establish a compelling brand and building an intriguing career narrative. These skills are leading factors between those who are stalled by disruption and those who accelerate through it. Disrupted! shares the perspective of talent leaders who are balancing the fast-paced expectations of companies against the skills of employees. And as the research of LaKesha Edwards uncovers, it means that employees will have to reset their career and own their own professional development. That's where SW&A closes the gap as Sally and Hurst Williamson introduce the tools needed to help anyone reset their career and build their own career narrative. "

From the  New York Times  bestselling author of  Life Is in the Transitions  comes a bold new road map for finding meaning and purpose in what you do, based on insights drawn from hundreds of life stories of Americans of all backgrounds.   \u00a0  America is at a once-in-a-generation turning point around work: unprecedented numbers are quitting their jobs, rethinking their routines, breaking away from stifling expectations. The most suffocating iron cage of all is the idea that each of us must follow a linear career\u2014lock into a dream early, always climb higher, never stop until you reach the top. Few ideas have squandered more human potential.  \u00a0  Employing his signature, immersive approach, Bruce Feiler is known for taking complex challenges and converting them into actionable steps that can help each of us live with more fulfillment and joy. From thousands of hours of interviews, Feiler has distilled a powerful new vision of work: The people who are happiest don\u2019t chase someone else\u2019s dreams; they chase their own. Freed from outdated scripts, they identify what brings them meaning and write their own story of success.   \u00a0   The Search  introduces an all-new toolkit for achieving that goal, 21 Questions to Find Work You Love. Practical and empowering, these questions will help you unearth the story of work you\u2019ve been trying to tell your whole life\u2014then go achieve it. You\u2019ll discover:   \u00a0  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The upsides and downsides of work you learned from your parents;  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why your childhood role model offers the best clue to what you should do now;  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who is your waymaker;  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When to leave a job and when to stay;  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is your purpose right now;  \u2026and much more.  \u00a0  From a master storyteller who\u2019s helped millions transform their lives for better,  The Search  arrives as the world reimagines the basic assumptions of work and offers a timely, urgent playbook for each of us to get the happiness we seek, the meaning we crave, and the success we deserve.

                "Growing up, we are often taught never to question the value of a good education. From the moment they \"graduate\" from making castles in sandboxes, the actions and interests of young adolescents are measured by how enticing they will appear on the almighty \"college application.\" But if you stop to consider that the total student debt in the United States is estimated to be $1.3 trillion (more than credit card and auto loan debt combined), you may begin to wonder what the true \"value\" of a college education actually is.  In Inspiring Champions in Manufacturing, the indomitable Terry M. Iverson challenges our culture's axiom that sustainable careers may only be achieved through a college education. Through his own love, heritage, and mastery of the fine art of manufacturing, Iverson contends that careers in manufacturing offer stability, security, and prosperity for our entire nation. Iverson illustrates the power of manufacturing through in-depth research, personal stories, and over forty interviews with some of the most remarkable authors, CEOs, sports figures, and other influencers.  While half of the book speaks directly to parents, the latter half shepherds inquisitive youth curious about the options available to them.  Inspiring Champions in Manufacturing teaches parents and students:  Why cultural pressure steers parents and high school students toward college  How college pathways leave even the brightest students in debt, deferring home purchases and more  The untold potential of a career in manufacturing  How the US has a skill shortage that rewards fulfillment with impressive salaries and advancement opportunities  How technological advances have made manufacturing into a digital ecosystem versus an industrial complex  Action plans for both parents and youth to get involved in manufacturing  Inspiring Champions in Manufacturing provides parents and students a roadmap for career success, self-fulfillment, and a zero-debt foundation. With their eyes wide open, students will be free to envision the monumental potential that awaits them in a manufacturing career. "

The ability to take ownership, manage expectations, navigate people dynamics, and communicate professionally-skills that school doesn't teach. Most career guides assume that you already know how the working world works. But if you're starting your very first job or taking a job in a new company, you might not know all the unspoken rules that determine who gets ahead and who doesn't. In The Unspoken Rules, you'll learn the basic workplace skills necessary for success. From the author: \"Over the last four years, I've interviewed over five hundred interns, early career professionals, managers, and executives. . . . My conversations revolved around three key topics: - What are the most common mistakes early-career professionals make at work? - What would you do differently if you could relive your first years on the job? - What do you think separates top performers from mediocre ones? After testing the advice I gathered from these hundreds of interviews, I started coaching other early-career professionals. Now I'm distilling everything I've learned into a step-by-step guide called The Unspoken Rules.\" "

While this advice may work for home life, as Kim Scott has seen first hand, it is a disaster when adopted by managers in the work place.  Scott earned her stripes as a highly successful manager at Google before moving to Apple where she developed a class on optimal management.  Radical Candor  draws directly on her experiences at these cutting edge companies to reveal a new approach to effective management that delivers huge success by inspiring teams to work better together by embracing fierce conversations.  Radical Candor  is the sweet spot between managers who are obnoxiously aggressive on the one side and ruinously empathetic on the other. It is about providing guidance, which involves a mix of praise as well as criticism \u2013 delivered to produce better results and help your employees develop their skills and increase success. Great bosses have a strong relationship with their employees, and Scott has identified three simple principles for building better relationships with your employees: make it personal, get stuff done, and understand why it matters.   Radical Candor  offers a guide to those bewildered or exhausted by management, written for bosses and those who manage bosses. Drawing on years of first-hand experience, and distilled clearly to give practical advice to the reader,  Radical Candor  shows you how to be successful while retaining your integrity and humanity.    Radical Candor  is the perfect handbook for those who are looking to find meaning in their job and create an environment where people love both their work and their colleagues, and are motivated to strive to ever greater success.

But as this practical book reveals, what's most important for leadership is principled consistency. Time and again, small things done well build trust and respect within a team. Using stories from his time at Netscape, Apple, and Slack, Michael Lopp presents a series of small but compelling practices to help you build leadership skills. You'll learn how to create teams that are highly productive, highly respected, and highly trusted. Lopp has been speaking and writing about this topic for over a decade and now maintains a Slack leadership channel with over 13,000 members. The essays in this book examine the practical skills Lopp learned from exceptional leaders-as a manager at Netscape, a senior manager and director at Apple, and an executive at Slack. You'll learn how to apply these lessons to your own experience. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin.  A decade since its original publication, the term 'go-giver' has become shorthand for a defining set of values embraced by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Today this timeless story continues to help its readers find fulfilment  and  greater success in business, in their personal lives and in their communities.  The Go-Giver  tells the story of an ambitious young man named Joe who yearns for success. Joe is a true go-getter, though sometimes he feels as if the harder and faster he works, the further away his goals seem to be. One day, desperate to land a key sale at the end of a bad quarter, he seeks advice from the enigmatic Pindar, a legendary consultant referred to by many devotees simply as the Chairman. Over the next week, Pindar introduces Joe to a series of successful 'go-givers' who teach him how to open himself up to the power of giving. Joe learns that changing his focus from getting to giving - putting others' interests first and continually adding value to their lives - ultimately leads to unexpected results.  The Go-Giver  is a classic bestseller that brings to life the old proverb 'Give and you shall receive'. 'This terrific book wonderfully illuminates the principles of contribution, abundance, service and success'  Stephen Covey, bestselling author of  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People   'Most people don't have the guts to buy this book, never mind the will to follow through and actually use it. But you do. And I'm certain that you'll be glad you did ' Seth Godin, bestselling author of  This is Marketing   \u00a9 Bob Burg and John David Mann 2010 (P) Penguin Audio 2022. "

Intelligence Isn't Enough    helps Black professionals make strategic decisions and learn the unspoken rules for success.  Recounting the frustration she felt as a young Black woman beginning her career, Carice Anderson knows that many Black professionals are relying on their education and intellect alone to be successful in the workplace. In this book, she empowers young Black professionals by equipping them with advice and little-known principles of career success from her experiences and interviews with thirty successful Black leaders.   Intelligence Isn't Enough  is divided into six chapters that guide readers through what Anderson calls the three major corporate muscle groups:  Knowing yourself- understanding your story and investigating your mindset   Knowing others-building and sustaining important relationships in the workplace  Knowing your environment-analyzing your organization's culture Anderson will teach you how to integrate the knowledge of these three groups to craft an authentic personal brand and communication style that will help you maximize your impact.  Using personal stories, quotes, lessons learned, and advice from both the author and Black leaders who have worked in some of the finest institutions across North America, Africa, and Europe, Black professionals will learn tips and tools to strategically chart their career paths and advance in the workplace for lifelong success.

The book makes the case that learners of the future are going to repeatedly seek out educational opportunities throughout the course of their working lives-which will no longer have a beginning, middle, and end. Long Life Learning focuses on the disruptive and burgeoning innovations that are laying the foundation for a new learning model that includes clear navigation, wraparound and funding supports, targeted education, and clear connections to more transparent hiring processes. Written by the former chief innovation officer of Strada Education Network's Institute for the Future of Work, the book examines: - How will a dramatically extended lifespan affect our careers? - How will more time in the workforce shape our educational demands? - Will a four-year degree earned at the start of a 100-year career adequately prepare us for the challenges ahead?.

We all know the pressure of feeling like we should be grinding 24/7 while simultaneously being told that we should 'just relax' and take care of ourselves, like we somehow have to decide between success and sanity. But in today's complex working world, where every hobby can be a hustle and social media is the lens through which we view not only others but also ourselves, this seemingly impossible choice couldn't be further from our reality.  In  Working Hard, Hardly Working , entrepreneur and self-proclaimed 'lazy workaholic' Grace Beverley challenges this unrealistic and unnecessary split, and offers a fresh take on how to create your own balance, be more productive and feel fulfilled.  Includes practical advice on:   \u00b7 The life-changing art of the to-do table:   perfect your productivity method and do more of what you love   \u00b7 Making your routine work for you:   optimise your habits and reap the benefits   \u00b7 Getting into and managing your flow:   boost your creativity and enjoy your everyday   \u00b7 Engaging in effective self-care:   how stepping back will help you move forwards  Insightful, curious and refreshingly honest,  Working Hard, Hardly Working  will make you reflect on what you want from your life and work - and then help you chart your path to get there. \u00a9 Grace Beverley 2021 (P) Penguin Audio 2021.

Rebuild  is a lift raft, a vital guide to how we reset and build back better.  Retail and brand expert Mary Portas argues that over the past thirty years the business of what we buy has been dominated by the biggest, fastest and cheapest. But those values no longer resonate. We've come to realize that more doesn't equal better. Good business is now about putting people and planet before profit. The post-pandemic era is all about care, respect and understanding the implications of what we're doing. This 'Kindness Economy' is a new value system which means that in order to thrive businesses must understand the fundamental role they can play in the fabric of our lives. They need to rediscover their authenticity, and balance brand magnetism and commerce with social progress. We're not simply consuming anymore, we're buying  into  something. Which means that, whether physical or digital, the most important space that any business can now occupy is the space in peoples' hearts. How to rebuild? Here's how. Full of expert insight and invaluable advice,  Rebuild  shows you how to reset the dial, reignite the passion and build back better. \u00a9 Mary Portas 2021 (P) Penguin Audio 2021. "

If you want to make movies, move to Los Angeles. If you want to work in publishing, you must be in New York. And if you're launching a start-up, you'll only succeed in Silicon Valley.  But with the meteoric rise of remote and freelance work, more people than ever are becoming location independent. Even doctors, teachers, and other people in more traditional occupations have to make tough choices about where they settle, because living in the right place can still make all the difference for your success and happiness.  So if work won't dictate where you live, how will you ever decide?  If You Could Live Anywhere answers that question. Melody Warnick unpacks the big-picture concerns that we often miss when we're writing pros-and-cons lists about potential destinations. Because the secret to being happy isn't moving, it's aligning your location with your values. You'll learn how to craft a personal location strategy that will make the most of your money, your community, and your life, with success stories from people who flexed their location independence to find homes and work they love.  The future of work is clear: it can happen wherever you are. So where do you really want to be?. "

Discover the diverse species necessary to owl survival, how climate change is affecting the landscape of their nesting site of past millennia, and what it takes to do field research in this action-packed addition to the award-winning Scientists in the Field series.   It's July on Alaska's North Slope, and scientist Denver Holt is in Utqiagvik surveying nests. Denver has been coming here since 1992, and the snowy owls he studies have been coming here much longer: thousands of years.  With its mix of coastal, low-elevation tundra and a rich presence of lemmings, the North Slope is the only area in Alaska where snowy owls regularly nest. How do snowy owls decide where they will nest? How do they manage to arrive at locations where food will be abundant? What drives the success of these delicate tundra ecosystems? These are the mysteries Denver is trying to solve to help ensure a bright future for these elegant hunters.  Supplemental PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Individuals everywhere are asking, \"How can I find my purpose?\" That's the wrong question. You don't find your purpose-you build it. The HBR Guide to Crafting Your Purpose debunks three misconceptions about purpose at work: that purpose is found, that you have only one, and that it remains the same over time. Packed with tips and advice for how you can cultivate more meaning in your life and at work, this book teaches you how to endow everything you do with purpose each day. You'll learn how to: find the reason behind your work; identify what makes you happy and engaged; use job crafting to transform your role; connect your work to service; build positive, fulfilling relationships; and let go of past purposes-and take steps toward new ones.

                "The future isn\u2019t about where we will work, but how. For years we have struggled to balance work and life, with most of us feeling overwhelmed and burned out because our relationship to work is broken. This\u00a0\u201cisn't just a book about remote work. It's a book that helps us imagine a future where our lives\u2014at the office  and  home\u2014are happier, more productive, and genuinely meaningful\u201d (Charles Duhigg, bestselling author of  The Power of Habit ).     Out of Office  is a book for every office worker\u00a0\u2013 from employees to managers \u2013 currently facing the decision about whether, and how, to return to the office. The past two years have shown us that there may be a new path forward, one that doesn\u2019t involve hellish daily commutes and the demands of jam-packed work schedules that no longer make sense. But how can we realize that future in a way that benefits workers and companies alike? \u00a0 Based on groundbreaking reporting and interviews with workers and managers around the world,  Out of Office  illuminates the key values and questions that should be driving this conversation: trust, fairness, flexibility, inclusive workplaces, equity, and work-life balance. Above all, they argue that companies need to listen to their employees \u2013 and that this will promote, rather than impede, productivity and profitability. As a society, we have talked for decades about flexible work arrangements; this book makes clear that we are at an inflection point where this is actually possible for many employees and their companies.  Out of Office  is about so much more than zoom meetings and hybrid schedules: it aims to reshape our entire relationship to the office. "
