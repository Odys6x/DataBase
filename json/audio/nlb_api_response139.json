                "Seventy-three years after the events of The Death Cure, when Thomas and other immunes were sent to an island to survive the Flare-triggered apocalypse, their descendants have thrived. Sadina, Isaac, and Jackie all learned about the unkind history of the Gladers from The Book of Newt and tall tales from Old Man Frypan, but when a rusty old boat shows up one day with a woman bearing dark news of the mainland-everything changes. The group and their islander friends are forced to embark back to civilization where they find Cranks have evolved into a more violent, intelligent version of themselves. They are hunted by the Godhead, the Remnant Nation, and scientists with secret agendas. When they cross paths with an orphan named Minho from the Remnant Nation, the dangers become real and they don't know who they can trust. The islanders will have to survive long enough to figure out why they are being targeted, who is friend or foe, and what the Godhead has planned for the future of humanity. "

Seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Bertelsen dreams of becoming an astronomer, but she knows such dreams are as unreachable as the stars she so deeply adores. As a Mormon girl, her duty is to her family and, in a not too far away future, to the man who'll choose to marry her. When she unexpectedly finds herself in Colorado, she's tempted by the total eclipse of the sun that's about to happen\u2014and maybe even meeting up with the female scientists she's long admired. Elizabeth must learn to navigate this new world of possibility: with her familial duties and faith tugging at her heartstrings, a new romance on the horizon, and the study of the night sky calling to her, she can't possibly have it all...can she?  *Includes a downloadable PDF of a Cast Of Characters from the book.

He doesn't know that Jamal tried to save him. And that the reason they haven't been friends for two years is because Jamal blames Q for the accident that killed his parents.  But what if Jamal could have a second chance? A new technology allows Q to be reanimated for a few weeks before he dies . . . permanently. And Q's mom is not about to let anyone ruin this miracle by telling Q about his impending death. So how can Jamal fix everything if he can't tell Q the truth?   Early Departures weaves together loss, grief, friendship, and love to form a wholly unique homage to the bonds that bring people together for life\u2014and beyond. "

Dick.   In an alternative 1987, a disease ravages human memories. There is no cure, only artificial recall. The lucky ones\u2014the recollectors\u2014need the treatment only once a day.  Freya Izquierdo isn't lucky. The high school senior is a \"degen\" who needs artificial recall several times a day. Plagued by blinding half-memories that take her to her knees, she's desperate to remember everything that will help her investigate her father's violent death. When her sleuthing almost lands her in jail, a shadowy school dean selects her to attend his Foxtail Academy, where five hundred students will trial a new tech said to make artificial recall obsolete.  She's the only degen on campus. Why was she chosen? Freya is nothing like the other students, not even her new friends Ollie, Chase, and the alluring Fletcher Cohen. Definitely not at all like the students who start to vanish, one by one. And nothing like the mysterious Dean Mendelsohn, who has a bunker deep in the woods behind the school.  Nothing can prepare Freya and her friends for the truth of what that bunker holds. And what kind of memories she'll have to access to survive it.   \"Vaca's debut is a thrilling and often unsettling examination of the elusive nature of memory and truth. The Memory Index will leave you breathlessly turning pages until its satisfying conclusion.\"  \u2014Jonathan Evison, New York Times bestselling author of Small World  Get hooked on The Memory Index Duology:  Book 1: The Memory Index  Book 2: The Recall Paradox (coming Spring 2023) "

In the world outside of the Haven Institute, Lyra and Caelum are finding it hard to be human\u2014and Lyra, infected at Haven with a terrible disease, finds her symptoms are growing worse. When Caelum leaves without warning, Lyra follows him, seeking a pioneering organization in Philadelphia that might have a cure. But what they uncover there is a shocking connection to their past, even as their future seems in danger of collapsing.  Though Gemma just wants to go back to her normal life after Haven, she soon learns that her powerful father has other plans for the replicas\u2014unless she and her boyfriend Pete can stop him. But they soon learn that they aren't safe either. The Haven Institute wasn't destroyed after all, and now Gemma is the one behind the walls.

                "Two sisters are torn apart by war and must fight their way back to each other in a futuristic, Black Panther-inspired Nigeria.  The year is 2172. Climate change and nuclear disasters have rendered much of earth unlivable. Only the lucky ones have escaped to space colonies in the sky.  In a war-torn Nigeria, battles are fought using flying, deadly mechs and soldiers are outfitted with bionic limbs and artificial organs meant to protect them from the harsh, radiation-heavy climate. Across the nation, as the years-long civil war wages on, survival becomes the only way of life.  Two sisters, Onyii and Ify, dream of more. Their lives have been marked by violence and political unrest. Still, they dream of peace, of hope, of a future together. And they're willing to fight an entire war to get there. Acclaimed author, Tochi Onyebuchi, has written an immersive, action-packed, deeply personal novel perfect for fans of Nnedi Okorafor, Marie Lu, and Paolo Bacigalupi. "

                "In this brand new reimagining, Mary Jane\u2014the red-headed spark from Mark Twain's  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,  who stole Huck's heart in just 30 pages\u2014comes to life with her own story of adventuring down the Mississippi River in the 1840s.   Meet Mary Jane Guild \u2014 she\u2019s on a dangerous and unpredictable adventure down the Mississippi River \u2014 and she\u2019ll steal Huck Finn\u2019s heart along the way.  In his classic work  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , Mark Twain briefly introduces \"Mary Jane, the red-headed one.\" In no time Mary Jane becomes the girl Huck thinks about \"a many and a many million times.\" Now author Hope Jahren has created for Mary Jane a life as vivid and compelling as Huck's. These pages will show you the  real  Mary Jane. A girl on her own dangerous, unpredictable journey down the Mississippi River in pre-Civil War America. Equipped with an uncanny ability for mathematics, a talent for sewing, and a bale of beaver skins, Mary Jane navigates deadly illnesses, angry mobs, treacherous landowners, outright thieves and swindlers, and more than a thousand miles of muddy water.\u00a0What\u2019s more, she  thrives  in the face of these challenges, thanks to support from strangers who become friends. Traveling solo requires Mary Jane to grow up fast, but it ultimately leads her to a new resilience, a love of adventure, deep and enduring sisterhood, and a blue-eyed, ponytailed boy she can\u2019t stop thinking about. Jahren offers a wealth of layered characters and deeply researched, authentic details of changing times in the North and South. Using the language and style of Twain and shifting the point of view to a smart and determined young woman, she explores timeless themes of duty, family, romance, and betrayal, with grit and courage at the core.  * This audiobook edition includes a downloadable PDF containing a map of the Mississippi River Valley ca. 1846, a family tree, and suggested reading.

A romantic debut about the exhilarating highs and messy lows that swirl together when high school comes to an end, perfect for fans of Carley Fortune and Jenny Han   Golden boy Caplan and bookish Mina have been unlikely soulmates since third grade.

Hope is dangerous. Love is deadly.    1506, Joseon.  The people suffer under the cruel reign of the tyrant King Yeonsan, powerless to stop him from commandeering their land for his recreational use, banning and burning books, and kidnapping and horrifically abusing women and girls as his personal playthings.  Seventeen-year-old Iseul has lived a sheltered, privileged life despite the kingdom\u2019s turmoil. When her older sister, Suyeon, becomes the king\u2019s latest prey, Iseul leaves the relative safety of her village, traveling through forbidden territory to reach the capital in hopes of stealing her sister back. But she soon discovers the king\u2019s power is absolute, and to challenge his rule is to court certain death.  Prince Daehyun has lived his whole life in the terrifying shadow of his despicable half-brother, the king. Forced to watch King Yeonsan flaunt his predation through executions and rampant abuse of the common folk, Daehyun aches to find a way to dethrone his half-brother once and for all. When staging a coup, failure is fatal, and he\u2019ll need help to pull it off\u2015but there\u2019s no way to know who he can trust.  When Iseul's and Daehyun's fates collide, their contempt for each other is transcended only by their mutual hate for the king. Armed with Iseul\u2019s family connections and Daehyun\u2019s royal access, they reluctantly join forces to launch the riskiest gamble the kingdom has ever seen:  Save her sister. Free the people. Destroy a tyrant.   Also by June Hur:    The Silence of Bones  The Forest of Stolen Girls  The Red Palace. "

Agnes Chan never expected to be the punchline of her own life . . . But how else do you explain getting accidentally run over and seeing a lifetime of careful preparation, endless training, and all your hopes of a track scholarship to college destroyed in a split second? Not to mention the only witness to your humiliation being your #1 archnemesis, Royce Taslim. So, when Agnes finds a new answer to her scholarship predicament in the form of an international stand-up comedy contest for teens, the last person she expects to be up against is also the last person she wants to see: Royce. Because for years Royce has represented everything Agnes loathes: extreme privilege, popularity, and physical perfection (ok maybe she doesn't hate that part\u00a0so\u00a0much). Behind the scenes, though, Royce's flawless fa\u00e7ade fades away, revealing someone Agnes never expected\u2014someone who shows her that perhaps the best parts of life are the ones you\u00a0aren't\u00a0prepared for\u2014and as the competition heats up, so do things between these two rivals.

[Series narrator Tamaryn] Payne brings the wry humor, boisterous personality, and incomparable wit of Enola to life so well that listeners will wish they could join her for tea.\" \u2014 AudioFile  on  Enola Holmes and the Elegant Escapade    In May of 1890, Enola Holmes is finally fully on her own and, no longer hiding from her older brothers Sherlock and Mycroft, attending classes and occasionally pursuing her chosen profession as a scientific perditorian, a finder of lost things and people. Wolcott Balestier, the representative of an American book publisher, arrived in London on a singular mission - to contract with English authors for their latest works. When Balestier disappears on the streets of London one day, his great friend - Rudyard Kipling - bursts into Enola's office looking for help in finding him. Brash and unwilling to hire a young woman, instead he turns to Sherlock Holmes. Convinced that evil has befallen Balestier, at the hands of rival American publishers who pirate the works of English authors, he sets the elder Holmes on the trail.  But Enola is not one to accept defeat, especially not to her brother, and sets off on her own - determined to learn the truth behind the disappearance of the young American. Can book publishing truly be so ruthless and deadly or can the missing man be rescued from his apparent fate and returned to his friends and loved ones? The redoubtable Enola is determined to do just that, even if it means working with her brother Sherlock!  A Macmillan Audio production from Wednesday Books. "

                "Salem, Massachusetts, 1692. Thomas is marked as an outcast the moment he steps off the ship from England. As a Quaker, he's outnumbered and distrusted by Salem's Puritans. And as an orphan without any useful skills, he has nowhere to live and no way to earn his keep. In a stroke of luck?perhaps good, perhaps not?he's taken in by the aged widow Prudence Blevins, who's rumored to be a witch. Patience has tried all her life to be a good Puritan?obedient to God and to her elders?and all her life, she has come up short. But her orderly world is upended when her younger sister, Abigail, falls victim to a mysterious affliction. The same torments have stricken other Salem girls, who claim they're being bewitched by servants of the Devil. Soon the girls, including Abigail, begin accusing neighbors of witchcraft. As the community becomes consumed by suspicion and fear, Thomas and Patience search for the truth. To protect those they care about, they will have to question everything they think they know: their faiths, their loyalties, and their places in Salem. "

A powerful saga of three teens, the children of refugees from a fallen African utopia, who must navigate their newfound powers in a climate-ravaged New York City. Perfect for fans of  Black Panther  and  Children of Blood and Bone .   For Zuberi, Uzochi, and Lencho, Nubia is a mystery. Before they were born, a massive storm destroyed their ancestral homeland, forcing their families to flee across the ocean to New York City. Nubia, a utopic island nation off the coast of West Africa, was no more, and their parents\u2019 sorrow was too deep for them to share much of their history beyond the folklore.  But New York, ravaged by climate change and class division, is far from a safe haven for refugees, and Nubians live as outcasts, struggling to survive in the constantly flooding lower half of Manhattan, while the rich thrive in the tech-driven sky city known as the Up High.  To many, being Nubian means you\u2019re fated for a life plagued by difficulties and disrespect. But Zuberi, Uzochi, and Lencho are beginning to feel there might be more. Something within them is changing, giving each of them extraordinary powers. Extraordinary and terrifying powers that seem to be tied to the secrets their parents have kept from them.  And there are people Up High watching, eager to do anything they can to become even more powerful than they already are. Now Zuberi, Uzochi, and Lencho will be faced with the choice\u2014do they use their inheritance to lift their people, or to leave them behind. The fate of their city, and their people, hangs in the balance. "

If it was fair, her crush and basketball hottie Jalen Thomas might see her as more than just her brother's kid sister. And if it was fair, her baba\u2019s brother and wife would be able to leave Afghanistan and come to America. Life might not be fair\u2014but she can make it a bit more even.

She can't even spend time with boys except at formal Visitations. Still, Stella feels lucky that her chaperone, Sister Helen, is like a friend to her. And then the unthinkable happens. Sister Helen dies suddenly, and Stella feels lost. Especially when she's assigned a new chaperone just days later. Sister Laura is...different. She has radical ideas about what Stella should be doing. She leaves Stella alone in public and even knows how to get into the \"Hush Hush\" parties where all kinds of forbidden things happen. As Stella spends more time with Sister Laura, she begins to question everything she's been taught. What if the Constables' rules don't actually protect girls? What if they were never meant to keep them safe? Once Stella glimpses both real freedom and the dark truths behind New America, she has no choice but to fight back against the world she knows, risking everything to set out on a dangerous journey across what used to be the United States.

There is often trouble of a mythical sort in Bath. The booksellers who police the Old World keep a careful watch there, particularly on the entity that inhabits the ancient hot spring.

The map takes the trio to a place separated from this world, maintained by deadly sorcery and guarded by monstrous living statues. But this is only the beginning. To unravel the secrets of a murderous Ancient Sovereign, the booksellers must investigate centuries of disappearances and deaths. If they do not stop her, she will soon kill again. And this time, her target is not an ordinary mortal. "

Social media followers eat up her takes on everything from UFOs to holiday overconsumption\u2014yet, she\u2019s still not cool enough for the popular kids\u2019 table. Which is why Brad  abandoned  her for the in-crowd years ago. (At least, that\u2019s how Celine sees it.) These days, there\u2019s nothing between them other than petty insults and academic rivalry. So when Celine signs up for a survival course in the woods, she\u2019s surprised to find Brad right beside her. Forced to work as a team for the chance to win a grand prize, these two teens must trudge through not just mud and dirt but their messy past. And as this adventure brings them closer together, they begin to remember the good bits of their history. But has too much time passed . . . or just enough to spark a whole new kind of relationship?

                "\"In a searing indictment of silent complicity, White Rose shines a light on one remarkable young woman's insistence on the power of truth, no matter the cost. A timely call to resistance.\" \u2013 Joy McCullough, author of Blood Water Paint  \"White Rose is a resonant testament to courage. In a time of horrific brutality, young people found a nonviolent way to resist. Told in the form of poetry, the story of their hopes is honored and brought back to life, still relevant today, when regimes that spread hatred are once again thriving, and words are our most powerful defensive weapon.\" \u2013 Margarita Engle, author of Newbery Honoree The Surrender Tree and 2017-2019 Young People's Poet Laureate.  \"Both heart-wrenching and inspiring, Sophie Scholl's story, as retold by Kip Wilson in White Rose, is a stunning reminder to stand against evil, even when you stand alone. This is the kind of book that sticks in your heart long after you've finished. An incredible story of heroism incredibly told.\" \u2013 Mackenzi Lee, author of New York Times Bestseller The Gentleman's Guide to Vice & Virtue  \"White Rose is a deftly plotted, absorbing read. A bold tribute to a brave hero of the German resistance during World War II. Wilson's debut is a triumph!\"  \u2014Melanie Crowder, author of National Jewish Book Award finalist Audacity  \"A graceful, moving portrait of a heroic young woman's defiant refusal to remain complicit with Nazi oppression.\" \u2013 Julie Berry, Printz Honor author of The Passion of Dolssa    A gorgeous and timely novel based on the incredible story of Sophie Scholl, a young German college student who challenged the Nazi regime during World War II as part of The White Rose, a non-violent resistance group.   Disillusioned by the propaganda of Nazi Germany, Sophie Scholl, her brother, and his fellow soldiers formed the White Rose, a group that wrote and distributed anonymous letters criticizing the Nazi regime and calling for action from their fellow German citizens. The following year, Sophie and her brother were arrested for treason and interrogated for information about their collaborators. This debut novel recounts the lives of Sophie and her friends and highlights their brave stand against fascism in Nazi Germany. "

                "The year is 2221, and humans have colonized an earthlike planet called Thetis in the Silver Foot Galaxy. After a tragic accident kills off dozens of teenage colonists, Thetis's leaders are desperate to repopulate. So the Mayflower 2, a state-of-the-art spaceship, sets off across the universe to bring 177 new recruits to the colony. For Jonah Lincoln, an orphaned teen who's bounced between foster homes and spent time on the streets of Cleveland, the voyage is a chance to reinvent himself, to be strong and independent and brave the way he could never be on Earth. But his dreams go up in smoke when their ship crash-lands, killing half the passengers and leaving the rest stranded-not on Thetis, but on its cruel and unpeopled moon, Achilles. Between its bloodthirsty alien life forms and its distance from their intended location, Achilles is far from an ideal resting place. The situation is already dire, but when all of the adults suddenly disappear, leaving the teenage passengers to fend for themselves, Jonah doubts they'll survive at all, much less reach Thetis. Especially when it appears Achilles isn't as uninhabited as they were led to believe. "

                "\"How quickly everything in the world disintegrates. Everything but the loneliness of young women.\"   So begins  The Whitsun Daughters , a story of three girls in a small Midwestern town, narrated by the ghost of a young Irish immigrant who, over a century earlier, lived and loved on the same small patch of farmland the girls and their mothers now call home. \u00a0 Award-winning author Carrie Mesrobian weaves the story of the girls\u2019 day-to-day struggles with the fractured and harrowing memories of their unseen observer. The threads of the tales are familiar: An arranged marriage. An impulsive proposal bitterly refused. Secret affairs. And pregnancies, both welcome and not. Each young woman fights her own lonely battle in the generations-long war of those who would no longer settle for haunting the margins of a world that wants to ignore them. "

                "\"A young girl who is empowered, capable, and smart...the Enola Holmes book series convey an impactful message that you can do anything if you set your mind to it, and it does so in an exciting and adventurous way.\" - Millie Bobby Brown  \"This audiobook is a welcome addition to an engaging and fast-paced series.\" -  AudioFile Magazine    Enola Holmes is back! Nancy Springer's nationally bestselling series and breakout Netflix sensation returns to beguile listeners young and old in  Enola Holmes and the Black Barouche .  Enola Holmes is the much younger sister of her more famous brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft. But she has all the wits, skills, and sleuthing inclinations of them both. At fifteen, she's an independent young woman - after all, her name spelled backwards reads \"alone\" - and living on her own in London. When a young professional woman, Miss Letitia Glover, shows up on Sherlock's doorstep, desperate to learn more about the fate of her twin sister, it is Enola who steps up. It seems her sister, the former Felicity Glover, married the Earl of Dunhench and per a curt note from the Earl, has died. But Letitia Glover is convinced this isn't the truth, that she'd know - she'd feel - if her twin had died. The Earl's note is suspiciously vague and the death certificate is even more dubious, signed it seems by a John H. Watson, M.D. (who denies any knowledge of such). The only way forward is for Enola to go undercover\u2014or so Enola decides at the vehement objection of her brother. And she soon finds out that this is not the first of the Earl's wives to die suddenly and vaguely\u2014and that the secret to the fate of the missing Felicity is tied to a mysterious black barouche that arrived at the Earl's home in the middle of the night. To uncover the secrets held tightly within the Earl's hall, Enola is going to require help\u2014from Sherlock, from the twin sister of the missing woman, and from an old friend, the young Viscount Tewkesbury, Marquess of Basilwether! Enola Holmes returns in her first adventure since the hit Netflix movie brought her back on the national bestseller lists, introducing a new generation to this beloved character and series.  A Macmillan Audio production from Wednesday Books. "

But now fans can treat\u00a0themselves to the epic drama\u2014and heroic hilarity\u2014of the classic\u00a0teen comedy rendered with the wit, flair, and iambic pentameter\u00a0of the Bard. Our heroine Cady disguises herself to infiltrate the\u00a0conniving Plastics, falls for off-limits Aaron, struggles with her allegiance\u00a0to newfound friends Damian and Janis, and stirs up age-old\u00a0vendettas among the factions of her high school. Best-selling author\u00a0Ian Doescher brings his signature Shakespearean wordsmithing\u00a0to this cult classic beloved by generations of teen girls and other\u00a0fans. Now, on the 15th anniversary of its release,\u00a0 Mean Girls\u00a0 is a\u00a0recognized cultural phenomenon, and it\u2019s more than ready for an\u00a0Elizabethan makeover.

Khadija Shami  is a Syrian American high school senior raised on boxing and football. Saddled with a monstrous ego and a fierce mother to test it, she dreams of escaping her sheltered life to travel the world with her best friend.    Leene Tahir  is a Syrian refugee, doing her best to adjust to the wildly unfamiliar society of a suburban Detroit high school while battling panic attacks and family pressures.    When their worlds collide the result is catastrophic. To Khadija, Leene embodies the tame, dutiful Syrian ideal she's long rebelled against. And to Leene, Khadija is the strong-willed, closed-off American who makes her doubt her place in the world.    But as Khadija digs up Leene's past, a startling and life-changing discovery forces the two of them closer together. As the girls secretly race to unravel the truth, a friendship slowly and hesitantly begins blooming. Doubts are cast aside as they realize they have more in common than they each expected. What they find takes them on a journey all the way to Jordan, challenging what each knows about the other and herself.     Fans of Samira Ahmed's  Love, Hate, and Other Filters  and Tahereh Mafi's  A Very Large Expanse Of   Sea  will love Khadija and Leene's sharp-witted voices in this dual POV narrative.  The Next New Syrian Girl  is a poignant and timely blend of guilt, nostalgia, devotion, and bad-ass hijabees. "

But Sybille and Rose soon discover they aren't the only girls who have their sights set on attending Her Majesty. The girls must compete against worldly and cunning opponents, among them mean-girl Avis and her entourage of back-stabbing co-horts, tipping the balance in their already-tenuous friendship. Soon, the grand hall is more like the hallway of a prestigious finishing school, with girls fighting for the attention of a dashing, young earl, amid parties fueled by drinking and indiscriminate dalliances. As the tension between Sybille and Avis heats up, the focus on Rose wanes, allowing her to turn her attention to more important matters-like getting close enough to the Queen to learn her secrets. But being close to the Queen is not without its challenges. And when rumors of Rose's influence make their way around the castle, no one, not even the Queen, will be safe. "

Quinn Berkowitz and Tarek Mansour's families have been in business together for years: Quinn's parents are wedding planners, and Tarek's own a catering company. At the end of last summer, Quinn confessed her crush on him in the form of a rambling email\u2014and then he left for college without a response.   Quinn has been dreading seeing him again almost as much as she dreads another summer playing the harp for her parents' weddings. When he shows up at the first wedding of the summer, looking cuter than ever after a year apart, they clash immediately. Tarek's always loved the grand gestures in weddings\u2014the flashier, the better\u2014while Quinn can't see them as anything but fake. Even as they can't seem to have one civil conversation, Quinn's thrown together with Tarek wedding after wedding, from performing a daring cake rescue to filling in for a missing bridesmaid and groomsman.   Quinn can't deny her feelings for him are still there, especially after she learns the truth about his silence, opens up about her own fears, and begins learning the art of harp-making from an enigmatic teacher. Maybe love isn't the enemy after all\u2014and maybe allowing herself to fall is the most honest thing Quinn's ever done. "

After bombing a stand-up set at her own bat mitzvah, Winnie has kept her jokes to herself. Well, to herself and her dad, a former comedian and her inspiration.  Then, on the second day of tenth grade, the funniest guy in school actually laughs at a comment she makes in the lunch line and asks her to join the improv troupe. Maybe he's even  . . . flirting?   Just when Winnie's ready to say yes to comedy again, her father reveals that he's been diagnosed with ALS. That is . . . not funny. Her dad's still making jokes, though, which feels like a good thing. And Winnie's prepared to be his straight man if that's what he wants. But is it what he needs? Caught up in a spiral of epically bad dates, bad news, and bad performances, Winnie's struggling to see the humor in it all. But finding a way to laugh is  exactly  what will see her through.  **A Junior Library Guild Selection**. "

So when Riley and Fairmont Academy mean girls June Phelan-Park and Dayton Nesseth die under suspicious circumstances, Mila refuses to believe everyone's explanation that her BFF was involved in a suicide pact. Instead, armed with a tube of lip gloss and an ancient grimoire, Mila does the unthinkable to uncover the truth: she brings the girls back to life.

Now, with only seven days until the spell wears off and the girls return to their graves, Mila must wrangle the distracted group of undead teens and work fast to discover their murderer...before the killer strikes again.

As a post-World War I wing walker, Grace is determined to get to the World Aviation Expo, proving her team's worth against flashier competitors and earning a coveted Hollywood contract. No one's ever questioned Grace's ambition until Henry Patton, a mechanic with plenty of scars from the battlefield, joins her barnstorming team. With each new death-defying trick, Henry pushes Grace to consider her reasons for being a daredevil. Annoyed with Henry's constant interference, and her growing attraction to him, Grace continues to test the powers of the sky. After one of her risky maneuvers saves a pilot's life, a Hollywood studio offers Grace a chance to perform at the Expo. She jumps at the opportunity to secure her future. But when a stunt goes wrong, Grace must decide whether Henry, and her life, are worth risking for one final trick. "

                "\"In a world where we are so often dividing ourselves into us and them, this book feels like a kind of magic, celebrating all beliefs, ethnicities, and unknowns.\" \u2014 The New York Times Book Review       Aristotle & Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe  meets Roswell by way of Laurie Halse Anderson in this astonishing, genre-bending novel about a Mexican American teen who discovers profound connections between immigration, folklore, and alien life.  It's been three years since ICE raids and phone calls from Mexico and an ill-fated walk across the Sonoran. Three years since Sia Martinez's mom disappeared. Sia wants to move on, but it's hard in her tiny Arizona town where people refer to her mom's deportation as \"an unfortunate incident.\"   Sia knows that her mom must be dead, but every new moon Sia drives into the desert and lights San Anthony and la Guadalupe candles to guide her mom home.   Then one night, under a million stars, Sia's life and the world as we know it cracks wide open. Because a blue-lit spacecraft crashes in front of Sia's car...and it's carrying her mom, who's very much alive.   As Sia races to save her mom from armed-quite-possibly-alien soldiers, she uncovers secrets as profound as they are dangerous in this stunning and inventive exploration of first love, family, immigration, and our vast, limitless universe.

In the next few hours, one of three things will happen.   1\u2014We'll be rescued (unlikely)   2\u2014We'll freeze to death (maybe)   3\u2014We'll be eaten by thin and athletic zombies (odds: excellent)   Vivian Ellenshaw is fat, but she knows she doesn't need to lose weight, so she's none too happy to find herself forced into a weight-loss camp's van with her ex-best friend, Allie, a meathead jock who can barely drive, and the camp owner's snobby son. And when they arrive at Camp Featherlite at the start of the worst blizzard in the history of Flagstaff, Arizona, it's clear that something isn't right. Vee barely has a chance to meet the other members of her pod, all who seem as unhappy to be at Featherlite as she does, when a camper goes missing down by the lake. Then she spots something horrifying outside in the snow. Something...that isn't human. Plus, the camp's supposed \"miracle cure\" for obesity just seems fishy, and Vee and her fellow campers know they don't need to be cured. Of anything. Even worse, it's not long before Camp Featherlite's luxurious bungalows are totally overrun with zombies. What starts out as a mission to unravel the camp's secrets turns into a desperate fight for survival\u2014and not all of the Featherlite campers will make it out alive.  A satirical blend of horror, body positivity, and humor, Kelly deVos's witty, biting novel proves that everyone deserves to feel validated, and taking down the evil enterprise determined to dehumanize you is a good place to start.

The Synod\u2014the Sitterhood's governing circle\u2014has called a Summit, a once-in-a-generation gathering that promises training, education, and whole lot of ice-breakers. Esme should be excited\u2014a Summit might mean she can finally get the answers she desperately wants\u2014but she can't shake a building sense of panic.

Abbi Hope Goldstein is like every other teenager, with a few smallish exceptions: her famous alter ego, Baby Hope, is the subject of internet memes, she has asthma, and sometimes people spontaneously burst into tears when they recognize her. Abbi has lived almost her entire life in the shadow of the terrorist attacks of September 11. On that fateful day, she was captured in what became an iconic photograph: in the picture, Abbi (aka \"Baby Hope\") wears a birthday crown and grasps a red balloon; just behind her, the South Tower of the World Trade Center is collapsing.  Now, fifteen years later, Abbi is desperate for anonymity and decides to spend the summer before her seventeenth birthday incognito as a counselor at Knights Day Camp two towns away. She's psyched for eight weeks in the company of four-year-olds, none of whom have ever heard of Baby Hope.  Too bad Noah Stern, whose own world was irrevocably shattered on that terrible day, has a similar summer plan. Noah believes his meeting Baby Hope is fate. Abbi is sure it's a disaster. Soon, though, the two team up to ask difficult questions about the history behind the Baby Hope photo. But is either of them ready to hear the answers?. "

The only thing Genesis, Holly and Zoe seem to have in common is being stuck in Violet, Montana. Well, that and the fact that Hope Harvest Ministries is trying to ruin their lives. \u00a0 Genesis lives on a commune that is now an echo of the New Age cult it once was. She\u2019s witnessed power couple Pastor Jay and Ree Reaps transform their sleepy small town into a haven for online Influencers, who flock to Violet, Bible in one hand and Ree\u2019s bestselling ACT LIKE A LADY, PRAY LIKE A BOSS in the other. Now, the Reaps have decided it\u2019s God\u2019s Will\u2122 that they take over Gen\u2019s ranch. \u00a0 Holly is a begrudging tourist, forced to spend the summer with her estranged father as punishment for her unsavory behavior back in LA. To Holly, Hope Harvest is nothing but a gimmicky marketing ploy, but it\u2019s threatening to put her father\u2019s diner out of business and, for some reason, Holly cares. \u00a0 All Zoe wants is to leave Violet, working thankless shifts at the diner to scrape together enough cash to start a new life with her girlfriend. But Zoe\u2019s mother has lost everything to the church\u2019s multilevel marketing schemes so the little money that Zoe manages to make goes right to debt collectors. \u00a0 The only solution to their problems is to scam the scammers and protect what\u2019s theirs.\u00a0It shouldn\u2019t take much \u2013 the Reaps\u2019 golden son, an accidental kidnapping, some light blackmail \u2013 and the Reaps\u2019 fortune will be in the girls\u2019 much more deserving hands.

Fourteen-year-old Nephele used to have friends. Well, she had  a  friend. That friend made the adjustment to high school easily, leaving Nephele behind in the process. And as Nephele looks ahead, all she can see is three very lonely years. Nephele is also a whip-smart lover of math and science, so she makes a plan. Step one: invent time travel. Step two: go back in time, have a do-over of 9th grade, crack the code on making friends and become beloved and popular.  Does it work? Sort of. Nephele does travel through time, but not the way she planned\u2014she's created a time loop, and she's the only one looping. And she keeps looping, for ten years, always alone. Now, facing ninth grade for the tenth time, Nephele knows what to expect. Or so she thinks. She didn't anticipate that her new teacher would be a boy from her long ago ninth grade class, now a grown man; that she would finally make a new friend, after ten years. And, she couldn't have pictured someone like Jazz, with his deep violet eyes, goofy magic tricks and the quietly intense way he sees her. After ten freshman years, she still has a lot more to learn. But now that she's finally figured out how to go back, has she found something worth staying for?. "

Fourteen-year-old Azar Rossi\u2019s first year of high school has mostly been silent, and intentionally so. After a bad case of colic as a baby, Azar\u2019s vocal folds are shredded\u2014full of nodules that give her a rasp the envy of a chain-smoking bullfrog. Her classmates might just think she\u2019s quiet, but Azar is saving her voice for when it really counts and talking to her classmates is not medically advisable or even high on her list. When she hears about a local Battle of the Bands contest, it\u2019s something she can\u2019t resist. Azar loves music, loves songwriting, but with her vocal folds the way they are, there's no way she can sing her songs on stage. \u00a0 Then she hears lacrosse hottie, Ebenezer Lloyd Hollins the Fifth, aka Eben, singing from the locker room. She\u2019s transfixed. He's just the person she needs. His voice + her lyrics = Battle of the Bands magic. But getting a band together means\u00a0Azar has a lot of talking to do and new friends to make. For the chance to stand on stage with Eben it might all just be worth it. "
