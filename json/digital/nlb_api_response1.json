She was a poor black tobacco farmer whose cells--taken without her knowledge in 1951--became one of the most important tools in medicine, vital for developing the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping, and more. Henrietta's cells have been bought and sold by the billions, yet she remains virtually unknown, and her family can't afford health insurance. This phenomenal New York Times bestseller tells a riveting story of the collision between ethics, race, and medicine; of scientific discovery and faith healing; and of a daughter consumed with questions about the mother she never knew.

                "How does a black American prepare for a career in a profession traditionally closed to blacks? And how does he or she cope with the frustrations and dangers that subsequent experiences generate? A-Train is the story of one of the black Americans who, during World War II, graduated from Tuskegee Army Flying School and served as a pilot in the 99th Pursuit Squadron. Charles W. Dryden has prepared an honest, fast-paced, balanced, vividly written, and very personal account of what it was like to be a black soldier, and specifically a pilot, during World War II and the Korean War. Colonel Dryden's book commands our attention because it is a balanced account by an insightful man who enlisted in a segregated army and retired from an integrated air force. Dryden's account is poignant in illuminating the hurt inflicted by racism on even the most successful black people. As a member of that elite group of those young pilots who fought for their country overseas while being denied civil liberties at home, Dryden presents an eloquent memoir of the experiences he has shared and the changes he has witnessed.

As an admissions officer specializing in diversity recruitment for independent prep schools, she persuaded students and families to embark on the same perilous journey she herself had made\u2014to attend cutthroat and largely white schools similar to The Taft School, where she had been the first African-American legacy student only a few years earlier. Her new job forced her to reflect on her own elite education experience, and to realize how disillusioned she had become with America's inequitable system. In ADMISSIONS, Kendra looks back at the three years she spent at Taft, chronicling clashes with her lily-white roommate, how she had to unlearn the respectability politics she'd been raised with, and the fall-out from a horrifying article in the student newspaper that accused Black and Latinx students of being responsible for segregation of campus. Through these stories, some troubling, others hilarious, she deconstructs the lies and half-truths she herself would later tell as an admissions professional, in addition to the myths about boarding schools perpetuated by popular culture. With its combination of incisive social critique and uproarious depictions of elite nonsense, ADMISSIONS will resonate with anyone who has ever been The Only One in a room, dealt with racial microaggressions, or even just suffered from an extreme case of homesickness.

                "As a 6'2\" dreadlocked black man, Tyler Merritt knows what it feels like to be stereotyped as threatening, which can have dangerous consequences. But he also knows that proximity to people who are different from ourselves can be a cure for racism.   Tyler Merritt's video \"Before You Call the Cops\" has been viewed millions of times. He's appeared on  Jimmy Kimmel  and  Sports Illustrated  and has been profiled in the  New York Times . The viral video's main point\u2014the more you know someone, the more empathy, understanding, and compassion you have for that person\u2014is the springboard for this book. By sharing his highs and exposing his lows, Tyler welcomes us into his world in order to help bridge the divides that seem to grow wider every day. In  I Take My Coffee Black,  Tyler tells hilarious stories from his own life as a black man in America. He talks about growing up in a multi-cultural community and realizing that he wasn't always welcome, how he quit sports for musical theater (that's where the girls were) to how Jesus barged in uninvited and changed his life forever (it all started with a Triple F.A.T. Goose jacket) to how he ended up at a small Bible college in Santa Cruz because he thought they had a great theater program (they didn't). Throughout his stories, he also seamlessly weaves in lessons about privilege, the legacy of lynching and sharecropping and why you don't cross black mamas. He teaches readers about the history of encoded racism that still undergirds our society today. By turns witty, insightful, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny,  I Take My Coffee Black  paints a portrait of black manhood in America and enlightens, illuminates, and entertains\u2014ultimately building the kind of empathy that might just be the antidote against the racial injustice in our society.

If you've watched television or movies in the past year, you've seen Michelle Buteau. With scene-stealing roles in  Always Be My Maybe ,  First Wives Club ,  Someone Great ,  Russian Doll , and  Tales of the City ; a reality TV show and breakthrough stand-up specials, including her headlining show  Welcome to   Buteaupia  on Netflix, and two podcasts ( Late Night Whenever  and  Adulting ), Michelle's star is on the rise. You'd be forgiven for thinking the road to success\u2014or adulthood or financial stability or self-acceptance or marriage or motherhood\u2014has been easy; but you'd be wrong.    Now, in  Survival of the Thickest , Michelle reflects on growing up Caribbean, Catholic, and thick in New Jersey, going to college in Miami (where everyone smells like pineapple), her many friendship and dating disasters, working as a newsroom editor during 9/11, getting started in standup opening for male strippers, marrying into her husband's Dutch family, IVF and surrogacy, motherhood, chosen family, and what it feels like to have a full heart, tight jeans, and stardom finally in her grasp.

Someone once told me those were the two worst things anyone could be. That someone was right. Where do I start? Being an introvert (as well as \"funny,\" according to the Los Angeles Times) in a world that glorifies cool isn't easy. But when Issa Rae, the creator of the Shorty Award-winning hit series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, is that introvert&#8212;whether she's navigating love, the workplace, friendships, or \"rapping\"&#8212;it sure is entertaining. Now, in this New York Times bestselling debut collection written in her witty and self-deprecating voice, Rae covers everything from cybersexing in the early days of the Internet to deflecting unsolicited comments on weight gain, from navigating the perils of eating out alone and public displays of affection to learning to accept yourself&#8212;natural hair and all. The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl is a book no one&#8212;awkward or cool, black, white, or other&#8212;will want to miss. "

Evers, with Myrlie as his partner in activism and in life, was doing civil rights work in the single most hostile and dangerous environment in America.\"\u2014from Medgar and Myrlie    By MSNBC's Joy-Ann Reid, a triumphant work of biography that repositions slain Civil Rights pioneer Medgar Evers at the heart of America's struggle for freedom, and celebrates Myrlie Evers's extraordinary activism after her husband's assassination in the driveway of their Mississippi home.    \"I love this book. The empathic, brilliant, and wise Joy Reid has brought us the poignant, fascinating inside story of Medgar and Myrlie Evers, transformational leaders who confronted pure evil and risked their lives to ensure that all American children might grow up in a United States that was more just. As Reid shows us, that painful task is now more urgent than ever.\" \u2014 Michael Beschloss   Myrlie Louise Beasley met Medgar Evers on her first day of college. They fell in love at first sight, married just one year later, and Myrlie left school to focus on their growing family.  Medgar became the field secretary for the Mississippi branch of the NAACP, charged with beating back the most intractable and violent resistance to black voting rights in the country. Myrlie served as Medgar's secretary and confidant, working hand in hand with him as they struggled against public accommodations and school segregation, lynching, violence, and sheer despair within their state's \"black belt.\" They fought to desegregate the intractable University of Mississippi, organized picket lines and boycotts, despite repeated terroristic threats, including the 1962 firebombing of their home, where they lived with their three young children.  On June 12, 1963, Medgar Evers became the highest profile victim of Klan-related assassination of a black civil rights leader at that time; gunned down in the couple's driveway in Jackson. In the wake of his tragic death, Myrlie carried on their civil rights legacy; writing a book about Medgar's fight, trying to win a congressional seat, and becoming a leader of the NAACP in her own right.  In this groundbreaking and thrilling account of two heroes of the civil rights movement, Joy-Ann Reid uses Medgar and Myrlie's relationship as a lens through which to explore the on-the-ground work that went into winning basic rights for Black Americans, and the repercussions that still resonate today.

This is the story of how I became an unapologetic Black disabled woman in a white world. This book is for people who look and live structurally like me to be valued, seen, heard and perhaps some advice on how to navigate life amongst white supremacy. This book is also for white people who have been \u201cdoing the work\u201d since the murder of George Floyd to read my story and be able to clearly see systemic oppression, racism, and ableism. There are books sharing the historical context of white supremacy, providing tips on how to be an ally or anti-racist, and firsthand experiences from Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) which are important. I push the conversation that leads to real change through my story. This book is for the Black woman who is looking to been seen and soft in shared lived experience. It is for the white person who is immersing themselves in the community they want to advocate for. It is for anyone who understands that learning and unlearning is lifelong.   \u00a0  White Supremacy Is All Around  arrives as the U.S.\u2019s ongoing racial reckoning has left readers searching for voices they can trust. BIPOC, disabled people, and other intentionally ignored Americans want to feel heard and empowered; organization leaders and allies invested in dismantling white supremacy want a framework for how best to contribute. Dr. Akilah Cadet speaks to all these needs, drawing from her life experiences and work helping leading brands build inclusive and equitable cultures to offer an informed perspective that prioritizes belonging. In a series of personal stories told with her trademark candor and wit, Dr. Cadet explores the long-term work required to combat structural oppression from her unique vantage point as a Black disabled woman. She tackles everything: from the 2020 \u201csummer of allyship \u201d  and depression caused by workplace discrimination to navigating disability and building a consulting business, all with a little inspo from Beyonc\u00e9.  \u00a0  A powerful call for true accompliceship for non-Black people, and a way for Black people to see and celebrate themselves,  White Supremacy Is All Around \u00a0ushers in a new voice that is timely, urgent, and essential\u2014and a vision we all need now.

                "In  Breaking Barriers , Judge Freddie Pitcher Jr. describes how he made history in Baton Rouge by becoming the first African American to be elected to judgeships at three different levels of the court system. Pitcher recounts his early years in Valley Park\u2014a segregated and semi-rural neighborhood\u2014where one of his cousins, a civil rights attorney, served as his role model and inspired him to become both a lawyer and an agent of change. Pitcher depicts what it was like to grow up in the segregated South and how racial discrimination fueled his drive to challenge the norms of the Baton Rouge judiciary later in life.  Pitcher discusses how he forged together Black political organizations, the Black church community, and a group of white attorneys into a campaign coalition that ultimately helped him overcome the racial barriers that prevented Black people from ascending to the judiciary in Baton Rouge. He details the strategy used to win seats on both the Baton Rouge City Court and the 19th Judicial District Court at a time when many said a Black candidate could not win a city- or parish-wide election. He describes many of the challenges he faced as the first and only Black judge in Baton Rouge while highlighting some of the notable cases he tried and sharing his beliefs about judging and the judicial process.  Pitcher's story of rising from \"the bench to the bar to the bench\"\u2014from the bench outside the local grocery store that he and his friends frequented as young boys, to the Louisiana bar, to the judicial bench\u2014is informative and inspiring, shedding light on the perseverance and determination required of early African American candidates to overcome the many roadblocks to full participation in the political process related to the judiciary.

She then joined the faculty of Howard University, where she taught for three decades of her long life spanning the tumultuous twentieth century.  &#160;  This book revives and critiques Tate&rsquo;s prolific and prescient body of scholarship, with topics ranging from nuclear arms limitations to race and imperialism in India, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. Tate credited her success to other women, Black and white, who helped her realize her dream of becoming a scholar. Her quest for research and adventure took her around the world twice, traveling solo with her cameras.  &#160;  Barbara Savage&rsquo;s skilled rendering of Tate&rsquo;s story is built on more than a decade of research. Tate&rsquo;s life and work challenge provincial approaches to African American and American history, women&rsquo;s history, the history of education, diplomatic history, and international thought. "

                "The first full-length biography of civil rights hero and congressman John Lewis     For six decades John Robert Lewis (1940\u20132020) was a towering figure in the U.S. struggle for civil rights. As an activist and progressive congressman, he was renowned for his unshakable integrity, indomitable courage, and determination to get into \"good trouble.\"    In this first book-length biography of Lewis, Raymond Arsenault traces Lewis's upbringing in rural Alabama, his activism as a Freedom Rider and leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, his championing of voting rights and anti-poverty initiatives, and his decades of service as the \"conscience of Congress.\"    Both in the streets and in Congress, Lewis promoted a philosophy of nonviolence to bring about change. He helped the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders plan the 1963 March on Washington, where he spoke at the Lincoln Memorial. Lewis's activism led to repeated arrests and beatings, most notably when he suffered a skull fracture in Selma, Alabama, during the 1965 police attack later known as Bloody Sunday. He was instrumental in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and in Congress he advocated for racial and economic justice, immigration reform, LGBTQ rights, and national health care.    Arsenault recounts Lewis's lifetime of work toward one overarching goal: realizing the \"beloved community,\" an ideal society based in equity and inclusion. Lewis never wavered in this pursuit, and even in death his influence endures, inspiring mobilization and resistance in the fight for social justice. "

Black jockeys like Murphy were at the top of the most popular sport in America at the end of the nineteenth century. They were internationally famous, the first African American superstar athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and with wins in three Kentucky Derbies and countless other prestigious races, Murphy was the greatest of them all.  \u00c2\u00a0  At the same time, he lived through the seismic events of Emancipation and Reconstruction and formative conflicts over freedom and equality in the United States. And inevitably he was drawn into those conflicts, with devastating consequences.  \u00c2\u00a0  Katherine C. Mooney uncovers the history of Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s troubled life, his death in 1896 at age thirty-five, and his afterlife. In recounting Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal story, she also tells two of the great stories of change in nineteenth-century America: the debates over what a multiracial democracy might look like and the battles over who was to hold power in an economy that increasingly resembled the corporate, wealth-polarized world we know today.

Bereal's work was inspired by his first photo exhibition at the George Washington Carver Museum in Austin, entitled  1.7 , that unearthed the experiences of the 925 Black men that made up just 1.7% of UT's total 52,000 student body. Now Bereal expands the scope of his original project and visits colleges nationwide, from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to predominantly white institutions to trade schools and more. Rather than dwelling on the monolith of trauma often associated with Black narratives, Bereal is dedicated to using honest dialogue to share stories of true joy and triumph amidst the hardships, prejudices, and internal struggles. Using an exciting and eclectic design approach to accompany the portraits and stories, each individual profile effectively conveys the interviewee's unique voice, tone, and background.  The Black Yearbook  reframes society's stereotypical perception of higher education by representing and celebrating the wide range of Black experiences on campuses. "

                "The debut memoir from award-winning journalist Morgan Campbell: an incredible history of a family\u2019s battles across generations, a hilarious and emotional coming-of-age story, and a powerful reckoning with what it means to be Black in Canada\u2014particularly when you have strong American roots.  Morgan Campbell comes from \u201ca fighting family,\u201d a connection and clash that reaches back to the south side of Chicago in the 1930s. His father\u2019s and mother\u2019s families were both part of the Great Migration from the U.S. rural south to the industrial north, but a history of perceived slights and social-class differences solidified a great feud that only intensified over the course of the century after the families came together in marriage and split up across the border. Morgan\u2019s maternal grandfather, Claude Jones\u2014a legendary grudge-holder, as well was an accomplished musician, peer of Oscar Peterson, and fixture of the Chicago jazz scene\u2014was recruited to play some shows in Toronto, fell in love with the city, and eventually settled in Canada in the mid-1960s, paving the way for Morgan\u2019s parents to join him amid the tumult of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement. Morgan\u2019s paternal grandmother, Granny Mary, however, remained stateside, a distance her schemes and resentments would only grow to fill.\u00a0 That fighting spirit wasn\u2019t limited to the family\u2019s own squabbles, though\u2014it animated the way every generation moved through the world. From battling back as a group against white supremacist newcomers who violently resisted Black neighbours, to Morgan\u2019s pre-teen mother burnishing her own legend by cold-cocking some racist loudmouth bullies, the lesson was clear: sometimes words weren\u2019t enough. In Canada, the Campbells started a family of their own, but the tensions between in-laws never ceased, even as divorce and disease threatened the very foundations of the life they\u2019d built. Bearing witness to all of this was young Morgan, an aspiring writer, budding star athlete, and slow-jam scholar, whose deep American roots landed him an outsider status that led to its own schoolyard scraps and exposed the profound gap between Canada\u2019s utopian multicultural reputation and the very different reality.\u00a0 Having grown up bouncing between these disparate identities and nationalities, real or imagined\u2014Black and Canadian, Canadian and American, Campbell and Jones\u2014 My Fighting Family  is a witty, wise, rich, and soulful illumination of the journey to find clarity in all that conflict.

In the 1980s, their mother headed an organization of Black women physicians, and for years the girls watched these fiercely intelligent women in white coats tend to their patients and neighbors, host community health fairs, cure ills, and save lives. What Dr. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock did not understand as a child\u2014or learn about at Harvard Medical School, where she and her sister had followed in their mother\u2019s footsteps, making them the first Black mother-daughter legacies from the school\u2014were the profound and long-standing systemic inequities that mean just 2 percent of all U.S. physicians today are Black women; the racist practices and policies that ensure Black Americans have far worse health outcomes than any other group in the country; and the flawed system that endangers the well-being of communities like theirs. As an ER physician, and later as a professor in academic medicine, Dr. Blackstock became profoundly aware of the systemic barriers that Black patients and physicians continue to face.  Legacy    is a journey through the critical intersection of racism and healthcare. At once a searing indictment of our healthcare system, a generational family memoir, and a call to action,  Legacy  is Dr. Blackstock\u2019s odyssey from child to medical student to practicing physician\u2014to finally seizing her own power as a health equity advocate against the backdrop of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.

(A companion Library of America volume,  Frederick Douglass: Autobiographies , gathers his three memoirs.) With startling immediacy, these writings chart the evolution of Douglass\u2019s thinking about slavery and the U.S. Constitution; his eventual break with William Lloyd Garrison and many other abolitionists on the crucial issue of disunion; the course of his complicated relationship with Abraham Lincoln; and his deep engagement with the cause of women\u2019s suffrage. \u00a0 Here are such powerful works as \u201cWhat to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?,\u201d Douglass\u2019s incandescent jeremiad skewering the hypocrisy of the slaveholding republic; \u201cThe Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered,\u201d a full-throated refutation of nineteenthcentury racial pseudoscience; \u201cIs it Right and Wise to Kill a Kidnapper?,\u201d an urgent call for forceful opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act; \u201cHow to End the War,\u201d in which Douglass advocates, just days after the fall of Fort Sumter, for the raising of Black troops and the military destruction of slavery; \u201cThere Was a Right Side in the Late War,\u201d Douglass\u2019s no-holds-barred\u00a0 attack on the \u201cLost Cause\u201d mythology of the Confederacy; and \u201cLessons of the Hour,\u201d an impassioned denunciation of lynching and disenfranchisement in the emerging Jim Crow South. \u00a0 As a special feature the volume also presents Douglass\u2019s only foray into fiction, the 1853 novella \u201cThe Heroic Slave,\u201d about Madison Washington, leader of the real-life insurrection on board the domestic slave-trading ship  Creole  in 1841 that resulted in the liberation of more than a hundred enslaved people. Editorial features include detailed notes identifying Douglass\u2019s many scriptural and cultural references, a newly revised chronology of his life and career, and an index. "

                "A black professor of classics takes on the cult of diversity, equity, and inclusion. In this compelling appeal to true justice, he demolishes the identity politics that makes a travesty of Martin Luther King's dream.  Martin Luther King's dream of a colorblind society is dead. Powerful political, educational, and corporate forces are making race the defining feature of American life, and nobody dares to stop them.    Naively confident in the \"marketplace of ideas,\" conservatives have done nothing as cultural Marxists have rewritten America's history and redefined its ideals. But we can't assume that poisonous ideas will simply wither when exposed to the light. The truth, argues the maverick black scholar Andre Archie, requires a spirited defense.    In  The Virtue of Colorblindness , Archie exposes the injustice of our emerging civil religion. Radical ideologues now teach our children that colorblindness is racism, while the \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" industry promotes policies that punish some people and reward others because of the color of their skin. Far from helping black Americans\u2014or any other Americans\u2014these racists of the left are sowing division, tribalism, and resentment.    The attack on colorblindness is anti-American and does not deserve a respectful hearing. It's time to fight back. "

Born in 1945, Ruth J. Simmons grew up the twelfth child of sharecroppers. Her first home had no running water, no electricity, no books to read. Yet despite this\u2014or, in her words, because of it\u2014Simmons would become\u00a0the first Black president of an Ivy League university. The former president of Smith College, Brown University, and Prairie View A&M, Texas\u2019s oldest HBCU, Simmons has inspired generations of students as she herself made history. In  Up Home,  Simmons takes us back to Grapeland to show how the people who love us when we are young shape who we become. We meet her caring, tireless mother who managed to feed her large family with an often empty pantry; her father, who refused to let racial and economic injustice crush his youngest daughter\u2019s dreams; the doting brothers and sisters; and the attentive teachers who welcomed Ruth into the classroom, guiding her to a future she could hardly imagine as a child. From the farmland of East Texas to Houston\u2019s Fifth Ward to New Orleans at the dawn of the civil rights movement, Simmons depicts an era long gone but whose legacies of inequality we still live with today. Written in clear and timeless prose,  Up Home  is both an origin story set in the segregated South and the uplifting chronicle of a girl whose intellect, grace, and curiosity guide her as she creates a place for herself in the world.

Given his one-of-a-kind, soaring falsetto, Aaron was the breakout star, and over the next six decades, he had four platinum albums, three\u00a0 #1 songs, numerous film and television appearances, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2014. His triple-platinum duets with Linda Ronstadt (including the Grammy-Award-winning hit \u201cI Don\u2019t Know Much\u201d) showcased the softer side of his voice, and the smoking hot funky soul of the Neville Brothers cemented his legacy as an R&B legend.  But few people know the challenging and circuitous road Aaron took to fame.\u00a0Born in a housing project in New Orleans of Black and Native American heritage, Aaron struggled as a teenage father working to raise a family while building his career as a musician, surviving a stint in jail for car theft and many years battling heroin addiction.  \u200bRecognized by the dagger tattoo on his cheek and his St. Jude medallion earring, Neville credits St. Jude\u2014the patron saint of lost cases\u2014for turning his life around. He found healing and salvation in music. Aaron Neville is a man who by all accounts should not have made it.  Tell It Like It Is  shares his story for the first time. "

                "The first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia reveals in her memoir how her Christian faith, unwavering patriotism, and fervent commitment to conservative principles propelled her to serve and sacrifice for her country and a better future.   Winsome Earle-Sears sent shock waves across Virginia and the country at large when she pulled off her stunning upset victory in November 2021 and became the first woman lieutenant governor of Virginia and the first Black woman, the first naturalized female citizen, and first female veteran elected to statewide office. She earned intense national coverage because of her unwavering support for Second Amendment rights and her strong commitment to education opportunity for all students. Now in her memoir,  How Sweet It Is , Winsome will tell her story and explain how she arrived at that historic moment in time.  \u00a0  A devout Christian, Winsome is also a true believer in the promise of the American Dream. Her father was approved to immigrate to the U.S.A. and left Jamaica, arriving in America on August 11, 1963, with only $1.75 in his pocket. Winsome joined him when she was just six years old, and ever since she has never ceased enthusiastically bucking conventions, defying expectations, and charging straight toward challenges.  \u00a0  Winsome\u2019s remarkable story is one of faith and family, personal loss and perseverance, philanthropy and patriotism, service and sacrifice. But through it all, her Christian faith sustained her, drove her, and compelled her to give back to her community and her country. Her unyielding belief in the fundamental righteousness of America stands in stark opposition to the increasingly pervasive ideologies that are dividing the country. In  How Sweet It Is , Winsome encourages Americans to never stop fighting for their country and shows them how to chart a new path forward. "

Jodi M. Savage was raised in Brooklyn, New York, by her maternal grandmother. Her whip-smart, charismatic mother struggled with addiction and was unable to care for her. Granny\u2014a fiery Pentecostal preacher who had a way with words\u2014was Jodi's rock, until Alzheimer's disease turned the tables, and a 28-year-old Jodi stepped into the role of caretaker. It was up to Jodi to get them both through the devastations of a deteriorating mind. After Granny passed away, Jodi spent years trying to reckon with her grief. Jodi and her mother were both diagnosed with breast cancer nearly a decade later, and then Jodi lost her too.  In this searing, candid collection of essays, Jodi illuminates the roles that identity and memory play in preserving those we love. Jodi explores the lives of modern Black women and communities through the prism of her personal experiences. With grace, creativity, and insight, she looks at femininity, family, race, mental illness, grief, healthcare, and faith. Jodi deftly portrays how trauma is inherited, and how the struggle to break a generational curse can last a lifetime.  The Death of a Jaybird is a thoughtful examination of complicated family love, loss, and the liberating power of claiming our stories. "

                "Aspiring business owners and executives seeking to climb to the next rung, young to mid-career professionals seeking tools for life achievement, and general readers interested in biographies of successful people will like Larry Thornton's  Why Not Win? . The book is a front-row seat to how one man altered his thinking to transform his life. The book begins with his growing up with brown skin in the 1960s in segregated Montgomery, Alabama. A desegregation school pioneer, Thornton was a classroom failure until a perceptive English teacher showed him he had value and encouraged him to go to college. Like the educator who changed his life, Thornton became a classroom teacher. But budget cuts took his job, and he decided to rewrite his story using his artistic talent. Thornton's artistry and work ethic got him attention at Coca-Cola, both for the good and the bad. He had to figure out a way to navigate this new world, where higher-ups praised him but co-workers reminded him of his \"blackness\" by drawing a noose in his workstation. He persevered by learning to appreciate and embrace diversity, people resources, and conflicting opinions. While his success grew at Coca-Cola, Thornton did the unthinkable: set out to be the first African American to own a McDonald's franchise in Birmingham. This thorny journey was peppered with threats, attempts to thwart his mission and a marriage he could not keep from falling apart. He absorbed the \"try, try and try again\" motto, and came to see that failure was a prelude to feasting upon the sweet fruit of success. Thornton's own mother never had a checking account, but years after her passing he found himself on the board of directors for a major financial institution. He slowly became a part of a small fraternity of captains of industry and fought past guilt and insecurity to pave the way for others who look like him to join him at the table. Trying to fit into this new world, he learned that \"Thank you,\" \"Please,\" and \"Excuse me\" are perhaps three of the most powerful phrases in communication. Thornton made up his mind that he would spend each day on a mission to show his unbending gratitude for his life and its benefits by fostering a supreme attitude and maintaining consistency in vision, purpose, and an unwavering commitment to principles. Thornton's journey from Madison Park, Montgomery, has been a long one.  Why Not Win?  reflects on his most useful lessons and the anecdotes associated with them. If he were a Zen monk, his koan might well be: \"Plan your past.\" By that he means, think ahead one day, one week, one year, even twenty years out, and decide today your desired outcome, and work for it. \"Thank God for memories,\" he says; \"Let's plan to make them pleasant ones.\" "

Winner of the Gold Medal for Memoir/Biography from the Military Writers Society of America   A  New York Times Book Review  Editors' Choice  Eugene Bullard lived one of the most fascinating lives of the twentieth century. The son of a former slave and an indigenous Creek woman, Bullard fled home at the age of eleven to escape the racial hostility of his Georgia community.

                "\" Leapfrogging  is as much about the secrets of breakthrough leadership as it is about business innovation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. loaded with fresh ideas and examples.\" \u2014Hans Middag, Director, Learning and Development, Randstad  In his trailblazing debut, Soren Kaplan gives business leaders the tools to do exactly what they're taught to avoid: embrace surprise\u2014the new key to business breakthroughs. Instead of fighting against uncertainty, Kaplan reveals how to use it to break down limiting mindsets and barriers to change the game. By highlighting specific ways to transform both good and bad surprises into unique opportunities, Kaplan encourages leaders to compete by embracing counterintuitive ideas, managing paradoxes, and even welcoming failure. This is the key to \"leapfrogging\" \u2014creating or doing something radically new or different that produces a significant leap forward.  Leapfrogging  connects new research, unconventional strategies, and practical tools for navigating the \"messy\" and elusive process of achieving business breakthroughs. Filled with real-world examples from innovators such as Gatorade, Intuit, Philips, Kimberly-Clark, Colgate-Palmolive, OpenTable, and Etsy, Kaplan shows that any organization or business function can leapfrog. Using his LEAPS process (Listen, Explore, Act, Persist, and Seize), leaders learn to seek out, recognize, and respond to surprising experiences and events as a way to create solutions that leap beyond the current expectations of customers, partners, employees, the market, and the competition. Kaplan's  Leapfrogging  is the new handbook for the modern leader.  \"Superbly crafted, powerful in its simplicity, offering smart, actionable learning\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Finally, a simple, holistic model that allows for breakthrough thinking and living.\" \u2014Mary Beth Robles, Vice President, Colgate-Palmolive   \"His campaigning for fearless innovation and flexibility is compelling.\" \u2014 Publishers Weekly.

Our Secret Society brilliantly illuminates a little known yet highly significant aspect of the civil rights movement that has been long overlooked\u2014the powerhouse fundraising effort that supported the movement\u2014the luncheons, galas, cabarets, and traveling exhibitions attended by middle-class and working-class Black families, the Negro press, and titans of industry, including Winthrop Rockefeller.  No one knew this world better or ruled over it with more authority than Mollie Moon. With her husband Henry Lee Moon, the longtime publicist for the NAACP, Mollie became half of one of the most influential couples of the period. Vivacious and intellectually curious, Mollie frequently hosted political salons attended by guests ranging from Langston Hughes to Lorraine Hansberry. As the president of the National Urban League Guild, the fundraising arm of the National Urban League; Mollie raised millions to fund grassroots activists battling for economic justice and racial equality. She was a force behind the mutual aid network that connected Black churches, domestic and blue-collar laborers, social clubs, and sororities and fraternities across the country.  Historian and cultural critic Tanisha C. Ford brings Mollie into focus as never before, charting her rise from Jim Crow Mississippi to doyenne of Manhattan and Harlem, where she became one of the most influential philanthropists of her time\u2014a woman feared, resented, yet widely respected. She chronicles Mollie's larger-than-life antics through exhaustive research, never-before-revealed letters, and dozens of interviews.  Our Secret Society ushers us into a world with its own rhythm and rules, led by its own Who's Who of African Americans in politics, sports, business, and entertainment. It is both a searing portrait of a remarkable period in America, spanning from the early 1930s through the late 1960s, and a strategic economic blueprint today's activists can emulate.

                "The pioneering TV news journalist shares her extraordinary story in this acclaimed memoir: \"A very important book\" (Dr. Maya Angelou).  As the first black female television journalist in the western United States, Belva Davis overcame the obstacles of racism and sexism, and helped change the face and focus of television news over the course of five decades. Born in the Great Depression to a fifteen-year-old Louisiana laundress, and raised in the projects of Oakland, California, Davis persevered to achieve a career beyond her imagination.  Davis has seen profound changes in America, from being verbally and physically attacked while reporting on the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco to witnessing the historic election of Barack Obama in 2008. She reported on some of the most explosive stories in modern American history, including the Vietnam War protests, the rise and fall of the Black Panthers, the mass suicides at Jonestown, the onset of the AIDS epidemic, and many others. She encountered everyone from Malcolm X to Frank Sinatra, James Brown, Ronald Reagan, Huey Newton, Muhammad Ali, Fidel Castro, Condoleezza Rice, and more. Davis spent her career on the frontlines of the battle for racial equality, bringing stories of black Americans into the light of day. Still active in her seventies, Davis hosted a news roundtable at one of the nation's leading PBS stations. In this way she remained engaged in contemporary journalism, while offering her unique perspective on the decades that have shaped us. "

Glaude Jr., author of    Begin Again   In 2020, heartsick from constant assaults on Black life, Tracy K. Smith found herself soul-searching and digging into the historical archive for help navigating the \u201cdin of human division and strife.\u201d With lyricism and urgency, Smith draws on several avenues of thinking\u2014personal, documentary, and spiritual\u2014to understand who we are as a nation and what we might hope to mean to one another. In Smith\u2019s own words, \u201cTo write a book about Black strength, Black continuance, and the powerful forms of belief and community that have long bolstered the soul of my people, I used the generations of my own patrilineal family to lean backward toward history, to gather a fuller sense of the lives my own ancestors led, the challenges they endured, and the sources of hope and bolstering they counted on. What this process has led me to believe is that all of us, in the here and now, can choose to work alongside the generations that precede us in tending to America\u2019s oldest wounds and meeting the urgencies of our present.\u201d  To Free the Captives  touches down in Sunflower, Alabama, the red-dirt town where Smith\u2019s father\u2019s family comes from, and where her grandfather returned after World War I   with a hero\u2019s record but difficult prospects as a Black man. Smith considers his life and the life of her father through the lens of history. Hoping to connect with their strength and continuance, she assembles a new terminology of American life.\u00a0 Bearing courageous witness to the terms of Freedom afforded her as a Black woman, a mother, and an educator in the twenty-first century,   Smith etches a portrait of where we find ourselves four hundred years into the American experiment. Weaving in an account of her growing spiritual practice, she argues that the soul is not merely a private site of respite or transcendence, but a tool for   fulfilling our duties to each other, and a sounding board for our most pressing collective questions: Where are we going as a nation? Where have we been?. "

Charles Adams is a product of the Minneapolis\u2019s North Side, the city\u2019s poorest neighborhood, and of North High, the state\u2019s poorest school. After graduation he joined the Minneapolis Police Department, overcoming racial prejudice within its ranks to become his alma mater\u2019s resource officer. North High was in rapid decline, a building designed for 1,700 students down to about 200. Once the centerpiece of the community, the school was on the verge of folding. Then something magical happened.  Adams stepped in as football coach, and transformed a winless team into state champions. With that success came renewed pride in the school and neighborhood both. As North High began to thrive, Adams was hailed as a model of what a Black man from a Black neighborhood might be. That lasted until Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, which brought a rain of chaos upon Minneapolis. Working to maintain order in a riotous city, Adams feared for his life, his relationship to his community forever changed.  The memoir of a life divided,  Twin Cities \u00a0is the story of what happens when a man gives everything to his city in an effort to help kids envision a better future, only to have his city turn on him in response. Adams navigates the space between reality and perception, between law and justice, with the insight and wisdom he has gained from his unique experience. "

Until Bettina Love unapologetically and painstakingly chronicled the last forty years of education 'reform' in this landmark book. I hated school because it warred on me. I hated school because I loved to dream.\"     \u2014Ibram X. Kendi,  New York Times  bestselling author of  How to be an Antiracist     In the tradition of Michelle Alexander, an unflinching reckoning with the impact of 40 years of racist public school policy on generations of Black lives  In  Punished for Dreaming  Dr. Bettina Love argues forcefully that Reagan's presidency ushered in a War on Black Children, pathologizing and penalizing them in concert with the War on Drugs. New policies punished schools with policing, closure, and loss of funding in the name of reform, as white savior, egalitarian efforts increasingly allowed private interests to infiltrate the system. These changes implicated children of color, and Black children in particular, as low performing, making it all too easy to turn a blind eye to their disproportionate conviction and incarceration. Today, there is little national conversation about a structural overhaul of American schools; cosmetic changes, rooted in anti-Blackness, are now passed off as justice. It is time to put a price tag on the miseducation of Black children. In this prequel to  The New Jim Crow , Dr. Love serves up a blistering account of four decades of educational reform through the lens of the people who lived it.  Punished for Dreaming  lays bare the devastating effect on 25 Black Americans caught in the intersection of economic gain and racist ideology. Then, with input from leading U.S. economists ,  Dr. Love offers a road map for repair, arguing for reparations with transformation for all children at its core. "

                "As a two-time Super Bowl champion, three-time Pro-Bowler, first round draft pick, and former Jim Thorpe Award recipient, Malcolm Jenkins knows a thing or two about winning.   Over the course of his thirteen-year NFL career, the now retired defensive back's triumphs extend beyond that on the football field. As a successful entrepreneur he has seen the blossoming of his business ventures with an eponymous company named Malcolm Inc., and a media conglomerate named Listen Up Media. As a philanthropist, he strives to make a positive difference in the lives of young people in underserved communities through The Malcolm Jenkins Foundation. And as the father of two daughters, he understands the challenges of loving his children, and preparing them for an often unkind and hostile world. But for every triumph, there is a tragedy, for every loss, a lesson.    In  What Winners Won't Tell You ,   Jenkins share with readers the insight he's gained from winning and losing alike. One moment, Jenkins is riding high from being the only NFL Player to have Super Bowl victories against Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady and then he's navigating the harrowing low of a divorce from the mother of his children. In another moment he's advocating for the advances of Black people in America, and then feuding publicly about the direction of this advocacy.    Providing fans and readers alike with an intimate portrayal of life on and off the field, detailed breakdowns of his greatest moments against the games premiere players, and poignant reflections about what it means to straddle the narrow line between victory and defeat,  What Winners Won't Tell You    is the best kept secret for those who want to know what it takes to be a champion.

In these pages, we meet his great-grandmother Sophia, a tenant farmer born with the gift of prophecy who scraped together a life in Jim Crow Alabama; his mother, Laurie, who raised four kids alone in an era when single Black mothers were demonized as \u201cwelfare queens\u201d; and a cast of family, friends, and neighbors who won small victories in a world built to swallow Black lives.\u00a0With profound honesty and compassion, he raises questions that implicate us all: What does each person\u2019s struggle to build a life teach us about what we owe each other? About what it means to be human?\u00a0 \u00a0  How Far to the Promised Land  is a thrilling and tender epic about being Black in America.\u00a0It\u2019s a book that questions our too-simple narratives about poverty and upward mobility; a book in which the people normally written out of the American Dream are given voice.

                "\"[A] masterly and often riveting account of King's ordeal and the 1960 'October Surprise' that may have altered the course of modern American political history.\" \u2014Raymond Arsenault,  The New York Times Book Review  (Editors' Choice)    The authors of  Douglass and Lincoln  present fully for the first time the story of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s imprisonment in the days leading up to the 1960 presidential election and the efforts of three of John F. Kennedy's civil rights staffers who went rogue to free him\u2014a move that changed the face of the Democratic Party and propelled Kennedy to the White House.  Less than three weeks before the 1960 presidential election, thirty-one-year-old Martin Luther King, Jr. was arrested at a sit-in at Rich's Department Store in Atlanta. That day would lead to the first night King had ever spent in jail\u2014and the time that King's family most feared for his life. An earlier, minor traffic ticket served as a pretext for keeping King locked up, and later for a harrowing nighttime transfer to Reidsville, the notorious Georgia state prison where Black inmates worked on chain gangs overseen by violent white guards. While King's imprisonment was decried as a moral scandal in some quarters and celebrated in others, for the two presidential candidates\u2014John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon\u2014it was the ultimate October surprise: an emerging and controversial civil rights leader was languishing behind bars, and the two campaigns raced to decide whether, and how, to respond. Stephen and Paul Kendrick's  Nine Days  tells the incredible story of what happened next. In 1960, the Civil Rights Movement was growing increasingly inventive and energized while white politicians favored the corrosive tactics of silence and stalling\u2014but an audacious team in the Kennedy campaign's Civil Rights Section (CRS) decided to act. In an election when Black voters seemed poised to split their votes between the candidates, the CRS convinced Kennedy to agitate for King's release, sometimes even going behind his back in their quest to secure his freedom. Over the course of nine extraordinary October days, the leaders of the CRS\u2014pioneering Black journalist Louis Martin, future Pennsylvania senator Harris Wofford, and Sargent Shriver, the founder of the Peace Corps\u2014worked to tilt a tight election in Kennedy's favor and bring about a revolution in party affiliation whose consequences are still integral to the practice of politics today. Based on fresh interviews, newspaper accounts, and extensive archival research,  Nine Days  is the first full recounting of an event that changed the course of one of the closest elections in American history. Much more than a political thriller, it is also the story of the first time King refused bail and came to terms with the dangerous course of his mission to change a nation. At once a story of electoral machinations, moral courage, and, ultimately, the triumph of a future president's better angels,  Nine Days  is a gripping tale with important lessons for our own time. "

The nine members of Congress are:   -Joseph Rainey, South Carolina  -Josiah Walls, Florida  -William B. Wilson, Pennsylvania  -Adolph Sabath, Illinois  -Oscar Stanton De Priest, Illinois  -Margaret Chase Smith, Maine  -Henry B. Gonzalez, Texas  -Shirley Chisholm, New York  -Barbara Jordan, Texas   Representative Joe Neguse, the first African American elected to the Congress from Colorado, shares how these nine ordinary Americans served nobly despite the barriers before them and did extraordinary things in service to their constituents, the Constitution, and the country.

                "Instant  New York Times, USA Today, Publishers Weekly , and  Wall Street Journal  Bestseller!   A powerful and unexpected memoir of family, faith, tragedy, and life's most important lessons.   The day after future NBA superstar Chris Paul signed his letter of intent to play college basketball for Wake Forest, he received a world-shattering phone call. His grandfather, Nathaniel \"Papa\" Jones, a pillar of the Winston-Salem community where he owned and operated the first Black-owned service station in North Carolina, was mugged and ultimately died from a heart attack resulting from the assault. His funeral filled the largest church in the county, which held over one thousand people. He was sixty-one years old. The day after burying his grandfather, Chris was coping the best way he knew how: by playing basketball for his high school team. After pouring in shot after shot, his last attempt was an airball purposely flung out of bounds from the foul line before Chris exited the game. The next day, local news headlines declared that he fell six points shy of the statewide single game high school scoring record. But he accomplished exactly what he set out to do: scoring sixty-one points, one for each year of life lived by his grandfather. In  Sixty-One , Chris opens up about life beyond basketball and the role his grandfather played in molding him into the man and father he is today. He'll speak about the foundation of faith and family he built his life upon, what it means to be a positive light within your community and beyond, and the importance of setting the proper example for future generations. Most importantly, Chris will talk about his home, Winston-Salem, and the close-knit family and village that raised him to become one of the most respected leaders in all of sports. "

                "A \"powerful and insightful\" (Cyntoia Brown-Long, author of  Free Cyntoia ) memoir in the vein of  Just Mercy  and  The Sum of Us  that upends our understanding about the future of policing in the United States and explores how we can begin healing from systemic injustice.  In 2012, nineteen-year-old Leon Ford was shot five times by a Pittsburgh police officer during a racially charged traffic stop stemming from a case of mistaken identity. When he woke up in the hospital, he was faced with two life-changing realities: he was a new father, and he was paralyzed from the waist down. Leon found the only way to move forward was to let go of his bitterness and learn to practice forgiveness.   Now, in this memoir and manifesto, Leon illustrates how this harrowing experience has inspired a deep reckoning with the issues his community is facing, not only with police brutality, but also an epidemic of street violence, toxic masculinity and its impact on Black fatherhood, and the lack of disability rights and mental health access in disenfranchised communities. In the wake of countless similar shootings across the country, Leon details how he turned towards social activism, dedicating himself to bridging the gap between the police and the communities they are supposed to serve.   With a voice filled with \"healing, triumph, and resilience\" (Shaka Senghor, bestselling author of  Writing My Wrongs ), Ford offers fresh, counterintuitive ways we can effect social change. Leon shows us how, together, we can move away from retribution and towards transformative justice in order to end police brutality and heal as a country. As he once said, \"Lead with love. Start compassionate conversations even with individuals and systems that have caused you pain. I know from experience that you can make your pain purposeful.\" "

A uniquely intimate history of Black liberation.\"  \u2013  Los Angeles Times    The long overdue story of the Shakurs, persistent fighters in the U.S. struggle for racial justice, and one of the most prominent, influential and fiercely creative families in recent history   For over fifty years, the Shakurs have inspired generations of activists, scholars, and music fans. Many people are only familiar with Assata Shakur, the popular author and thinker, living for three decades in Cuban exile; or the late rapper Tupac. But the branches of the Shakur family tree extend widely, and the roots reach into the most furtive and hidden depths of the underground. Whether founding one of the most notorious Black Panther chapters in the country, spearheading community-based healthcare, or engaging in armed struggle with systemic oppression, the Shakurs were at the forefront.  They have been celebrated, glorified, and mythologized. They have been hailed as heroes, liberators, and freedom fighters. They have been condemned, pursued, imprisoned, exiled, and killed. But the true and complete story of the Shakur family\u2014one of the most famous names in contemporary Black American history\u2014has never been told.  An Amerikan Family is a history of the fight for Black liberation in the United States, as experienced and shaped by the Shakurs. It is a story of hope and betrayal, addiction and murder, persecution and revolution. Drawing from hundreds of hours of personal interviews, historical archives, court records, transcripts, and other rare documents, An Amerikan Family tells the complete and often devastating story of Black America's long struggle for racial justice and the nation's covert and repressive tactics to defeat that struggle. It is the story of a small but determined community, taking extreme, unconventional, and often perilous measures in the quest for freedom.  In short, the story of the Shakurs is the story of America.

                "This book honors the voices of African Americans of the Civil War era through their letters, inviting readers to engage personally with the Black historical experience.  Amidst bloody battles and political maneuvering, thousands of African Americans spent the Civil War trying to hold their families together. This moving book illuminates that struggle through the letters they exchanged. Despite harsh laws against literacy and brutal practices that broke apart Black families, people found ways to write to each other against all odds. In these pages, readers will meet parents who are losing hope of ever seeing their children again and a husband who walks fifteen miles to visit his wife, enslaved on a different plantation. The collection also includes tender courtship letters exchanged between Lewis Henry Douglass and Helen Amelia Loguen, both children of noted abolitionists, and letters sent home by the young women who traveled south to teach literacy to escaped slaves. Roberts' expert curation allows readers to see the wider historical context. The transcriptions are accompanied by reproductions of selected original letters and photographs of the letter writers. FRESH ANGLE ON HISTORY: Roberts reframes the Civil War era by telling the story of American slavery through letters. And by focusing on the strong bonds of love that these letters represent, she offers a deeply human and relatable version of history. AUTHORITATIVE YET ACCESSIBLE: Throughout the book, Roberts provides expert context while weaving compelling stories about the individual letter writers. Readers can connect with history directly by reading actual words from the time and seeing photographs of both the letters and the writers. NUANCED PERSPECTIVE: As Americans wake up to the complex legacy of race in this country, Roberts' book challenges a notion of a monolithic Black experience during the Civil War. BEAUTIFUL BOOK: This handsome hardcover provides an elegant presentation, complete with images throughout. While intense and often tragic, the stories carry inspiration for how to live and love through incredibly difficult times. This will make a truly meaningful addition to any book collection.    Perfect for: Readers of Black history, Civil War history, and American history  History students  Letter writers  Fans of historical letters. "

                "An award-winning journalist tells the story of his quest to reconcile with his white mother and the family he\u2019d never met\u2014and how faith brought them all together.    \u201cA compelling and courageous journey that bears witness to the realities of systemic racism, the complexity of identity within that system, and the possibilities of reconciliation.\u201d\u2014Robin DiAngelo,  New York Times  bestselling author of  White Fragility   John Blake grew up in a notorious Black neighborhood in inner-city Baltimore that became the setting for the HBO series  The Wire . There he became a self-described \u201ccloseted biracial person,\u201d hostile toward white people while hiding the truth of his mother\u2019s race. The son of a Black man and a white woman who met when interracial marriage was still illegal, Blake knew this much about his mother: She vanished from his life not long after his birth, and her family rejected him because of his race. But at the age of seventeen, Blake had a surprise encounter that uncovered a disturbing family secret. This launched him on a quest to reconcile with his white family. His search centered on two questions: \u201cWhere is my mother?\u201d and \u201cWhere do I belong?\u201d  More Than I Imagined  is Blake\u2019s propulsive true story about how he answered those questions with the help of an interracial church, a loving caregiver\u2019s sacrifice, and an inexplicable childhood encounter that taught him the importance of forgiveness. Blake covered some of the biggest stories about race in America for twenty-five years before realizing that \u201cfacts don\u2019t change people, relationships do.\u201d He owes this discovery to \u201cradical integration,\u201d which was the only way forward for him and his family\u2014and is the only way forward for America as a multiracial democracy.  More Than I Imagined  is a hopeful story for our difficult times. "

                "This extraordinary memoir of struggle and perseverance offers new ways of envisioning economic equality for  everyone \u2014from a leading activist and fashion pioneer.       \u201cWith community and sisterhood at its center,  Wildflower  teaches us that against all odds, we can overcome.\u201d\u2014Rupi Kaur,  New York  Times bestselling author of  milk and honey    ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2023:  Harper\u2019s Bazaar   Aurora James\u2019s life is a great American \u201csuccess story\u201d\u2014precisely because it looks so different from others we\u2019ve seen. Born in Canada to a counterculture mother, James was raised to question everything\u2014specifically the very institutions that have shaped so many of us. When James was seven, her mother married a man who would move them to Jamaica, where James would learn harsh lessons about control, power, abuse, and belonging. Eventually she would find her way back home to Toronto, where her blue-eyed and fair-haired grandmother welcomed her with unconditional love\u2014and inadvertently showed her that racism is the water in which we are all submerged. \u00a0 Scouted as a model in eighth grade, James struggled with body image and became disenchanted by the industry\u2019s objectification of women and commodification of race and culture. After she dropped out of high school, a flirtation with street racing led to her eventual arrest. She\u2019d hit rock bottom, but as a visionary and optimist, she allowed that experience to become one of many that reshaped her way of thinking about the world. A slew of fashion-related jobs led James to discover the real power in creating for the runway, and she started her own business in a flea market: a sustainable fashion line showcasing traditional African designs that would become an award-winning international brand. But none of this came from a drive to \u201csucceed.\u201d It came from a desire to forge a new creative path\u2014and to lift others up alongside her. \u00a0 Already a rising star in fashion and the first Black female designer to win a Council of Fashion Designers of America Award, James posted a revolutionary idea in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder that connected economics to racial justice in a way that has forever changed the American economic landscape. With that Instagram post, she founded the Fifteen Percent Pledge, which challenges retailers to commit 15 percent of their shelf space and spending power to Black businesses and is one of the fastest-growing social justice nonprofits. To date, more than two dozen of the world\u2019s most recognized retailers have taken the pledge, redirecting $10 billion in annual revenue to Black and BIPOC brands. \u00a0 Empowering and full of heart,  Wildflower  is the riveting story of how Aurora James made an indelible mark the American economic system, and a rallying cry for those eager to make change.

                "The rediscovery of a pivotal figure in Black history and his importance and influence in the struggle against slavery and discrimination     Born on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Samuel Ringgold Ward (1817\u2013c. 1869) escaped enslavement and would become a leading figure in the struggle for Black freedom, citizenship, and equality. He was extolled by his contemporary Frederick Douglass for his \"depth of thought, fluency of speech, readiness of wit, logical exactness.\" Until now, his story has been largely untold.    Ward, a newspaper editor, Congregational minister, and advocate for the temperance movement, was considered one of the leading orators of his time. After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 he fled to Canada, where he lectured widely to improve conditions for formerly enslaved people who had settled there. Ward then went to Britain as an agent of the Canadian Antislavery Society and published his influential book  Autobiography of a Fugitive Negro . He never returned to the United States, and he died in obscurity in Jamaica.    Despite Ward's prominent role in the abolitionist movement, his story has been lost because of the decades he spent in exile. In this book, R. J. M. Blackett brings light to Ward's life and his important role in the struggle against slavery and discrimination, and to the personal price he paid for confronting oppression. "

                "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    \"[An] outstanding debut.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly (starred review)    The award-winning journalist and co-host of CBS Saturday Morning tells the candid, and deeply personal story of her mother's abandonment and how the search for answers forced her to reckon with her own identity and the secrets that shaped her family for five decades.   Though Michelle Miller was an award-winning broadcast journalist for CBS News, few people in her life knew the painful secret she carried: her mother had abandoned her at birth. Los Angeles in 1967 was deeply segregated, and her mother\u2014a Chicana hospital administrator who presented as white, had kept her affair with Michelle's father, Dr. Ross Miller, a married trauma surgeon and Compton's first Black city councilman\u2014hidden, along with the unplanned pregnancy. Raised largely by her father and her paternal grandmother, Michelle had no knowledge of the woman whose genes she shared. Then, fate intervened when Michelle was twenty-two. As her father lay stricken with cancer, he told her, \"Go and find your mother.\"  Belonging is the chronicle of Michelle's decades-long quest to connect with the woman who gave her life, to confront her past, and ultimately, to find her voice as a journalist, a wife, and a mother. Michelle traces the years spent trying to make sense of her mixed-race heritage and her place in white-dominated world. From the wealthy white schools where she was bussed to integrate, to the newsrooms filled with white, largely male faces, she revisits the emotional turmoil of her formative years and how the enigma of her mother and her rejection shaped Michelle's understanding of herself and her own Blackness.  As she charts her personal journey, Michelle looks back on her decades on the ground reporting painful events, from the beating of Rodney King to the death of George Floyd, revealing how her struggle to understand her racial identity coincides with the nation's own ongoing and imperfect racial reckoning. What emerges is an intimate family story about secrets\u2014secrets we keep, secrets we share, and the secrets that make us who we are. "

                "The uplifting autobiography of a remarkable aviator who was the first African American and first double amputee licensed as a racing pilot  In 1926, a young Neal Loving saw a de\u00a0Havilland DH-4 biplane that propelled his dreams of taking to the sky.  Loving\u2019s Love  is the inspiring autobiography about his journey to get there. Only a recent high school graduate when he built his first full-size flying machine at a time when most flying schools, airports, and aviation jobs excluded African Americans, Loving went on to design and fly five aircraft, open an aviation school, and become the first African American to be licensed as a racing pilot. Loving faced no small number of obstacles. Barred by racist gatekeeping from serving in the Civil Air Patrol during World War II, Loving and a friend created an all-Black squadron to serve their country. And despite undergoing a double leg amputation after a glider crash, Loving shares his story with unflinching optimism. He got fitted with wooden prosthetic legs and was back to flying just two years after his accident. The book offers readers an intimate and engaging look at Loving's career, with a focus on his WR-1  Loving\u2019s Love ,\u00a0a single seat, midget racer he built in 1950 that won him the 1954 Most Outstanding Design award from the\u00a0Experimental Aircraft Association. At 40 years old, Loving enrolled as an aeronautical engineering student and after graduating spent the next 20 years as a civilian specialist for the Air Force. After retiring, he continued flying for almost a decade. Neal Loving experienced a lifetime of thrills and challenges, and  Loving\u2019s Love  captures the candid life story of a courageous man who defied the odds again and again. "
