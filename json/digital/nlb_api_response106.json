                "\"To be successful in the 21st century global marketplace you need many things - determination, well-articulated goals, and a bit of luck. But more than anything else, you need kindness. Kindness becomes the key business asset when you couple a caring attitude toward others with a focus on achieving your goals. Often people see business as a choice between being kind and being successful. This is a fictitious trade-off. Nice people are more successful. Those who wish to succeed in the 21st century business climate which is characterized by intense competition, ever-evolving technologies, and escalating expectations, must make the conscious development of kindness their business imperative. The successes of many of the most accomplished professionals come as a result of developing the Five Powers of Kindness: 1. Reputation: Being trusted and building a strong reputation; 2. Reciprocity: Garnering reciprocal kindnesses from others; 3. Personality: Learning to be someone that others like; 4. Thanks: Being gracious and appreciative of others; and 5. Connecting: Building a strong network of relationships. In Capitalizing on Kindness you will learn simple techniques to harness the Five Powers to your professional advantage.\"--Publisher's description. "

Into these interconnected vignettes Aboujaoude weaves his own personal experiences while presenting up-to-date, accessible medical information. Rich in both meaning and symbolism, Compulsive Acts is a journey of personal growth and hope that illuminates a fascinating yet troubling dimension of human experience as it explores a group of potentially disabling conditions that are too often suffered in silence and isolation.\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "We were created to work, and our work provides unique meaning and purpose in our lives. Yet today we are living in a crisis of apathy and ignorance regarding work's theological and existential nature.  There is no shortage of books pleading with people to work less, to find \"balance,\" to think less of career and more of the things that bring them \"happiness.\" Likewise, there is no shortage of books making the case that work matters a great deal\u2014that good things come from fruitful labor. This book belongs in neither of those categories.   In  Full-Time: Work and the Meaning of Life , David Bahnsen makes the case that our understanding of work and its role in our lives is deeply flawed\u2014we are unmoored from what he calls \"created purpose.\" He argues that the time has come to stop tip-toeing around the issues that matter, that separating one's identity from what they do is demonstrably false, and that this era of alienation is for many a direct result of a low view of work. It is in work\u2014effort, service, striving\u2014of every kind that we discover our meaning and purpose; a significant and successful life is one rooted in full-time productivity and cultivation of God's created world.   This book is not your normal \"defense of work\" book. Whether you are a leader, a follower, a boss, an employee, in a white collar or blue collar job, highly paid or \"just getting by,\" this book is for you. A life of meaning is right under your nose, and with it the joy and peace of a life well-lived.   \"David Bahnsen is a theologically grounded, vocationally minded, and Biblically focused man with a vision to make work a gift to the world. In this book, he does just that. Combining thoughtful cultural analysis, conservative economic theory, and practical application for how to live these ideas out in the real world, I am grateful for the keen insights he lays out here. This book is a great combination of ideas and application that I think will serve many well.\" \u2014 Jon Tyson , Author, Pastor, Church of the City NYC   \"Far too many of us believe that we need to work in order to be able to live, and that's it. We need to eat, and so we work. David Bahnsen's new book leans heavily in the opposite direction, meaning that God gave us the gift of life so that we might have the grace and privilege of working. Highly recommended.\" \u2014 Pastor Douglas Wilson , Christ Church. "

                "The creator of the #1 professional and personal development program in professional sports reveals his winning playbook for unleashing your God-given potential.  At 5'6\" and from a small town in Iowa, JJ Moses recognized that his childhood dream of playing in the NFL was a long shot. To overcome the overwhelming odds, he knew he needed to be prepared for any opportunity God sent his way. Still, it took a disappointing start to his college football career for a switch to finally flip. What followed was the creation of an integrative method so trailblazing and effective that it propelled him to seemingly impossible heights of success. In fact, Moses not only became a seasoned pro on the gridiron's grandest stage, but he also realized that the same process he used to get a competitive edge could help others embrace their own winning mindset.   When his playing days were over, Moses brought the \"Prepare to Win\" program to his former NFL team's front office, where it quickly evolved into the league's gold standard curriculum for motivating players to exceed their potential and become effective leaders. Thoughtfully weaving professional insight with emotional and spiritual guidance, Moses has now tailored his step-by-step strategy for a wide audience, unlocking the previously untold secrets to consistent high performance. As much for aspiring leaders as experienced executives,  Focused  is the blueprint for taking yourself, your team, and your community to the next level. "

                "Have you ever been loved with \"skimpy love\"? Or has your love for someone else seemed to shrivel? Enter the world of God's extravagant love: It is beyond measure. Careful study of God's Word, along with delving into ancient customs and symbols from Biblical times, helps us understand His passionate love for all He has created.  If we call someone  extravagant , we're usually thinking about his spending habits and luxurious way of life.  So to use that word for a homeless man who had only one change of clothes\u2014an itinerant teacher who depended on others for food and shelter\u2014seems a stretch. Yet Jesus was the most extravagant person who ever lived.    Carole Engle Avriett invites you to redefine your notion of \"extravagant.\" In this study of ancient customs and ways of life, you'll gain an understanding of the cultural context of the Scriptures and of twelve key characteristics of God's nature, giving you a new appreciation of God's love in all its fullness.    You may think you know what love is, but not until you've experienced His extravagant love will you understand what it's like to be loved by a King . . . the unrestrained and lavish God whose passion draws souls into eternity.

                "\"The advice contained in this book comes from those who have succeeded in their writing careers. The sensible counsel in this well-written anthology has immediate and long-term benefits for the serious writer.\"    --Ray Newton, National Coordinator,\u00a0  Reader's Digest Writing Workshops    The Chapter One starts with a lucid commentary on writing. Writing is a creative act. Building a nonfiction book requires planning, structure and lots of labor. Your intellectual property is a piece of art; it will not design itself or be created overnight.    Writing a book is a journey, a trip to be enjoyed on the way to the reward at the destination. Learning as you research your subject is stimulating. The thought process of distilling the pertinent information for your readers is invigorating. Crafting just the right words to convey your message is energizing and provides the power to maintain your writing momentum. The published book is your goal but the process is fun. You are fortunate to be a writer.    Chapter Two focuses on the rationale of writing. There are many justifications for investing your time and money in writing a nonfiction book. Some are fame, fortune, to help other people and/or because you have a personal mission.    Chapter Three stresses need of a book. A nonfiction book is a product, an information product that is inexpensive to manufacture and easy to distribute. A book speaks with more authority than other media.    Chapter Four explains a reader what to write. In First, decide whether to entertain or inform. In other words, decide between fiction and nonfiction. As you will discover, nonfiction is easier to sell.    Chapter Five stresses on Research. Most of a nonfiction writer's time is spent in study. You must locate and read through all the relevant materials available in other books, magazines, newsletters, newspapers, interviews, museums, historical societies, public libraries, university libraries and special (law, medical) libraries. You have an obligation to your audience, to your book and to yourself to exhaust every possible source of information.    Chapter Six focuses on Building your book. It is hard to put some time aside to write. But we all encounter unexpected bits of time throughout our day. With the binder under your arm, the project will be constantly active in your mind. As you visit a friend, walk on the beach or see a film, you will be searching for relevant ideas, stories, examples, quotations and sources. Chapters eight till nine explains details of Copyrights, Finding an Agent, and Book Promotion. "

Now you may print shorter runs at prices that make sense, publish your \"books\" in other (electronic) ways, sell them automatically and promote them for practically nothing. You will discover how to wring maximum value out of your work. This is an exciting time to be a writer.    To be successful, a book needs writing, design, production and promotion. I organized and automated some of these functions years ago. The last elements just recently fell into place to establish the New Book Model. You will love it!    There is not enough room in one manual to include everything that you should know about writing nonfiction. Consequently, Para Publishing has prepared many supplemental reports (called documents, special  reports or instant reports) that are referenced in relevant places throughout this book. You may not want or need these supplements right now, but when you do, you can find them on our Web site (by typing in the document number in the search box) or by contacting us  by email, telephone or fax. I am also including numerous Web site addresses for more information. If you are reading the downloadable or CD editions of this book, you  may click on the URLs and go directly to the sites.  My system works. In the back of The Self\u2212Publishing Manual , I ask readers to send me their books once they publish. I receive 15 to 20 books each week.    Thank you for investing your time and money to allow me to share this new book\u2212writing concept with you. I will make sure your time and money are well invested.    Dan Poynter, Santa Barbara. "

That is, if you have that luxury. Many don't. This is one of the big problems. People are overdrawing on their biological sleep banks.     Seventy million are sleepless in America. We're a nation of walking zombies. Loss of sleep is creating a loss to business of 100 billion dollars a year. People have more accidents and are just grumpier folks. Fooling around with your sleep patterns only a couple of hours a week can dramatically affect your mood swings. Many people don't know how it feels to be wide- awake and alert or their old selves again. Fire Captain Bob Smith tells us to eat stress at breakfast and enjoy rest of the day!. "

Nearly every one wants to write a book. Most people have the ability, some have the drive, but few have the organization. Therefore, the greatest need is for a simple system, a road map. The basic plan in this book will not only provide you with direction, it will promote the needed drive and expose abilities you never thought existed.    Writing a book is probably easier than you think! If you can voice an opinion and think logically, you can write a book. If you can say it, you can write it. Most people have to work for a living and therefore can spend only a few minutes of each day on their book. Consequently, they can't keep the whole manuscript in their head. They become overwhelmed and confused, and find it easy to quit the project. The solution is to break up the manuscript into many small, easy-to-attack chunks (and never start at page 1, where the hill looks steepest). Then concentrate on one section at a time and do a thorough job on each one.    Dan was prompted to write this book because so many authors and publishers wanted to know his secret to selling so many books. Now he is revealing to you the secrets of writing, producing and promoting your book-the good life of self-publishing. "

Intelligent agent technology is a tool of modern computer science that can be used to engineer complex computer programmes that behave rationally in dynamic and changing environments. Applications range from small programmes that intelligently search the Web buying and selling goods via electronic commerce, to autonomous space probes.\u00a0   This powerful technology is not widely used, however, as developing intelligent agent software requires high levels of training and skill.\u00a0The authors of this book have developed and tested a methodology and tools for developing intelligent agent systems.\u00a0With this methodology ( Prometheus ) developers can start agent-oriented designs and implementations easily from scratch saving valuable time and resources.    Developing Intelligent Agent Systems  not only answers the questions \"what are agents?\" and \"why are they useful?\" but also the crucial question: \"how do I design and build intelligent agent systems?\" The book covers everything a practitioner needs to know to begin to effectively use this technology - including an introduction to the notion of agents, a description of the concepts involved, and a software engineering methodology.   Read on for:   a practical step-by-step introduction to designing and building intelligent agent systems.   a full life-cycle methodology for developing intelligent agent systems covering specification, analysis, design and implementation of agents.    PDT: Prometheus Design Tool  \u2013 software support for the  Prometheus  design process.   the example of an electronic bookstore to illustrate the design process throughout the book.   Electronic resources including the Prometheus Design Tool (PDT), can be found at:  http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/agents/prometheus    This book is aimed at industrial software developers, software engineers and at advanced undergraduate students. It assumes knowledge of basic software engineering but does not require knowledge of Artificial Intelligence or of mathematics. Familiarity with Java will help in reading the examples in chapter 10.

We think we have a roadmap that will guide us towards success. But it isn't long before life throws some curve-balls at us. Florence Gildea looks at a series of myths that we cannot help but absorb from films, fairytales, songs, and advertisements: that we get to call the shots and have control over how our lives turn out; that a happily ever after is within our reach. All the strategies we have learned to make ourselves safe, loveable, and successful will backfire. Life, it turns out, is found exactly where Jesus said it was: at the end of ourselves, at the foot of the cross. "

The reason for our struggle is that productivity and time-management systems focus on individual habits rather than more meaningful and lasting lifestyle changes.

We experience AI in our daily lives through our fitness trackers, home digital assistant systems, and curated news services, to name a few examples. For talent development, this is no different. The fields of artificial intelligence and talent development have been on a collision course for decades, and their convergence has already occurred. It has just taken many in our profession some time to recognize this fact. On the horizon, AI-powered innovations are transforming the workplace and the role of the talent development professional, affecting recruiting to training to compensation. As such, there are actions TD professionals should take now to prepare ourselves and our organizations for the evolving AI revolution. In AI in Talent Development, Margie Meacham describes the benefits, uses, and risks of AI technology and offers practical tools to strengthen and enhance learning and performance programs. In layman's terms, Meacham demonstrates how we can free time for ourselves by employing a useful robot \"assistant,\" create a chatbot for specific tasks (such as a new manager bot, a sales coach bot, or new employee onboarding bot), and build personalized coaching tools from AI-processed big data. She concludes each of the six chapters with helpful tips and includes a resource guide with planning tools, templates, and worksheets. Meacham dispels fear of AI's black box\u2014the term used to describe its unknowability and opacity\u2014and points out ways AI can help us be better at creativity and critical thinking, what we humans do best.

                "Master the Production of Virtual Events and Improve Engagement Have you ever found yourself confidently delivering content for a virtual training session, webinar, or online meeting only to have a participant drop off? Or, have you bravely launched breakout sessions but found that participants got lost on where to go? These scenarios illustrate the convergence of virtual session facilitation and production. While attention is most often paid to the facilitation of virtual sessions, significantly less is devoted to producing them. Producing Virtual Training, Meetings, and Webinars rectifies this gap. In this book, Kassy LaBorie, go-to training expert and co-author of Interact and Engage! 50 Activities for Virtual Training, Meeting, and Webinars, guides you through the production knowledge and skills a trainer needs to master the production of virtual events while delivering engaging training, productive meetings, and captivating webinars\u2014from how to prepare the technology and content beforehand to how to run everything smoothly. Using examples from and discussing differences among common virtual conferencing platforms such as Adobe Connect, Blackboard, Zoom, Webex, GoTo suite, and Microsoft Teams, LaBorie offers a plan of action for conquering just about any platform and troubleshooting potential problems. This book thoroughly examines typical platform features (audio, webcam, chat, screen share), advanced interaction methods (polling, breakouts, Q&A), and administration and logistics elements (logins, session scheduling, reports). With production in mind, you'll also learn how to: \u2022 Design session materials. \u2022 Prepare attendees to participate before and during the session. \u2022 Build successful virtual working relationships with presenters. Through stories, templates, checklists, and examples, LaBorie shares about her 20-plus years of engaging participants successfully in thousands of virtual events and gets you up to speed in no time.

But such success is super rare and not always how it plays out for great leaders. \u00a0 The reality is that most leaders are responsible for corporations, teams, and products they didn\u2019t launch from the ground up. Tyler Reagin saw the immense need to address this mission-critical but often overlooked aspect of leadership: healthy transition for leaders who inherit teams, places, or platforms others created. \u00a0 His groundbreaking book  Leading Things You Didn\u2019t Start  provides a faith-based four-step plan that answers practical questions such as: \u2022 Do I really want to take over something loved by so many? \u2022 Is there a secret sauce to doing what the leaders before me did? \u2022 How do I get the current team on board with my leadership? \u2022 How do I honor the past without being trapped by it? \u2022 How do I steward the legacy of the leaders who started the movement? Through the use of tried-and-true coaching principles and practical case studies with leaders like Buzz Williams, head coach at Texas A&M, and Cheryl Bachelder, former CEO of Popeyes, Reagin helps you maximize your newfound influx of influence and master the intentions of an inheriting leader.

We all know these systemic inequalities persist, so why haven't we fixed them yet? Dion Johnson has excelled in her field as a black woman in a white man's world; facially disfigured in a beauty-obsessed world; a devoted Christian in a secular world. She knows first-hand how unequal the system can be.  \u00a0  In 2013, Dion, led by God, began challenging women leaders to respond to the call to show up, speak up and shake things the hell up in their industry. Since then, Dion has served passionately as a strategic ally supporting women to evolve, rise above leadership challenges, and be more influential in their role. In this book she offers a development framework for senior leaders who want to initiate hard change without sabotaging their health or self-esteem.  \u00a0  Influential Woman has the power to spark a revolution in the way we lead and do business - to make the marketplace a force for love, justice and equality. We are influential women and now is our time to rise up and take action!. "

For David L. Steward, founder and chairman of World Wide Technology, his philosophy for building a successful business is simple and founded on a Biblical principle: \"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve\" (Mark 10:45 NIV). As a business leader, he says, the first priority is to serve employees.    Together with Brandon K. Mann, these two leaders distill their wisdom in this field guide for leaders who want to bring respect, integrity, honesty, and trust to the workplace. Steward and Mann draw from personal experiences as well as share insights and examples of how God's Word has informed and influenced their leadership. Each chapter ends with a section titled Your Leadership Flywheel: Learn, Live, Lead, Legacy, which includes self-reflection questions, application of biblical principles, as well as a prayer. "

Freeman,\u00a0 Wall Street Journal \u00a0best-selling author of\u00a0 The Next Right Thing    \u00a0  Imagine how different your life would be if you spent your time doing the very thing that brings you the greatest joy. It\u2019s possible, but most people spend their days making incremental advances on numerous tasks, competent at many things but exceptional at none. That\u2019s because for too long we\u2019ve believed the lie that more activity, more jobs, and more responsibility equals greater effectiveness. In short, we are becoming a society of \u201cjacks-and-jills-of-all-trades and masters of none.\u201d   But what if you could shift your focus from too many things to one?  In this thought-provoking book, you\u2019ll discover the exponential power of pursuing a singular craft. Through practical principles, Jordan Raynor provides straightforward steps for finding and thriving in your calling. He also highlights more than a dozen real-life examples of high-impact individuals who have chosen to focus on and excel in their unique gifting, including:  \u2022\u00a0 Chronicles of Narnia \u00a0author C. S. Lewis  \u2022 Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins  \u2022 TV legend Mister Rogers  \u2022 Dallas Mavericks CEO Cynthia Marshall  \u2022 Reality TV star Chip Gaines  \u2022 NFL Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy  \u2022 Biblical figures, a teacher, a pilot, a banker, and world-class entrepreneurs  Too many of us are overwhelmed, overcommitted, and overstressed. This book offers a better way\u2014the path to becoming a master of one!. "

This can change.    In  Mining for Gold , pastor and master-coach, Tom Camacho, offers a fresh perspective on how to draw out the best in ourselves and in those around us. Cutting through the complexity and challenges of leadership development, he gives us practical and effective tools to help leaders grow personally and develop those around them.  Coaching, through the power of the Holy Spirit, provides the clarity and momentum we need to grow. When we get clarity, everything changes. Coaching helps us better understand our identity in Christ, our God-given wiring, and how we naturally bear the most fruit.    There is gold in God's people, waiting to be discovered. Let's learn to draw out that treasure and help others flourish in their life and leadership. "

Temptation, greed, dishonesty, and misguided ambition have always presented challenges for Christians in the workplace. Add secular bias, political correctness, and persecution to the mix, and the modern workplace becomes a foreboding environment for Christians to navigate. This is so much the case, many Christians wonder if it is still possible to earn a living without compromising their faith.      Christians on the Job  does more than demonstrate that Christians can stand firm when confronted with faith-related dilemmas in the workplace. It also demonstrates how to go about it. Using concepts illustrated with real-life examples, steps to implement in specific situations, life application questions, and resources for going deeper, Dr. Goetsch draws a clear map to ensure Christians can find their way and thrive on the job.

                "Just three seconds. The time it takes to make a decision. That's all that lies between settling for \"Whatever\" . . . or insisting on \"Whatever it takes.\"  3 Seconds shows how to unleash the inner resources that can move you to a whole new level of success. It comes down to six predictable impulses that most of us automatically accept without a second thought. You can replace them with new impulses that lead toward impact and significance.  For instance, it takes Three Seconds to . . .  Disown Your Helplessness - The First Impulse: \"There's nothing I can do about it.\" The Second Impulse: \"I can't do everything, but I can do something.\"  Quit Stewing and Start Doing - The First Impulse: \"Someday I'm going to do that.\" The Second Impulse: \"I'm diving in . . . starting today.\"  Fuel Your Passion - The First Impulse: \"I'll do what happens to come my way.\" The Second Impulse: \"I'll do what I'm designed to do.\"  Inhale . . . exhale . . . the difference of your lifetime can begin in the space of a single breath. The decision is yours. Start today. "
