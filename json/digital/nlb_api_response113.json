A primary goal of this volume is to describe several of the most important types of research designs that have been pioneered recently by mathematics and science educators; have distinctive characteristics when they are used in projects that focus on mathematics and science education; and have proven to be especially productive for investigating the kinds of complex, interacting, and adapting systems that underlie the development of mathematics or science students and teachers or for the development, dissemination, and implementation of innovative programs of mathematics or science instruction.\" \"The volume emphasizes research designs that are intended to radically increase the relevance of research to practice, often by involving practitioners in the identification and formulation of the problems to be addressed or in other key roles in the research process. Examples of such research designs include teaching experiments, clinical interviews, analyses of videotapes, action research studies, ethnographic observations, software development studies (or more generally, curricula development studies) and computer modeling studies.\" \"A second goal of the volume is to begin discussions regarding the nature of appropriate and productive criteria for assessing (and increasing) the quality of research proposals, projects or publications that are based on the preceding kind of research designs. A final objective is to describe such guidelines in forms that will be useful to graduate students and others who are novices to the fields of mathematics or science education research.\"--Jacket. "

The idea that questions answered on a questionnaire or discussed in a focus group can provide useful insights on which to base business decisions is the cause of product failures, political blunders and wasted billions.

The resulting analyses vividly exemplify what each approach looks like in action. The researchers then probe the similarities and differences among their approaches; their distinctive purposes and strengths; the role, style, and subjectivity of the individual researcher; and the scientific and ethical complexities of conducting qualitative research. Also included are the research participant's responses to each analysis of her experience.
