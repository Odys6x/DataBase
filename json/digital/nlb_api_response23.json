                "In focusing on a particular type of workplace violence, i.e., violence committed by mentally ill clients against those who work in the field of mental health, this study examined the routine activities of employees who worked in the mental-health field and the subsequent role that their routines may have played in their victimization experiences. The study population consisted of mental health employees who worked in Western Pennsylvania. The population, as defined by the Department of Public Welfare-Office of Mental Health under Title 55 of the Pennsylvania Code, was composed of mental health workers who were employed in licensed mental health facilities, including outpatient, inpatient, partial hospitalization, crisis, family-based, long-term structured residence, and community residential rehabilitation. Based on the sampling frame, facilities were limited to those that were licensed, which excluded employees who worked in private practice. The final sample size was 449, with 162 working in nonresidential facilities, 157 in residential facilities, and 130 in crisis facilities. In order to test the hypotheses, a questionnaire was designed to obtain information on employees' routine activities and patterns of criminal victimization. The questionnaire was administered to determine the relationship between the three central elements of routine activities theory -- exposure to potential offenders, guardianship, and target suitability -- and victimization at work. Verbal aggression, verbal threats, and physical attacks were examined over the past 12 months, with attention to the frequency as well as the nature of the aggression. Findings show that those employees who viewed more of their weekly client contacts as dangerous were more likely to experience victimization. Type of mental disorder, number of weekly client contacts, and setting provided weak or no support for the alternative hypotheses, in that the variables did not have a significant impact on victimization. Those who worked in crisis facilities were more likely to experience victimization than those who worked in residential and/or nonresidential facilities. Working evening or night shifts was associated with an increased risk of victimization. Males were more likely to be victimized than females, except in types of sexual assault. Some of these findings provide strong support for routine activities theory, as well as rich data on violence in the field of mental health. Several policy or practical implications are drawn from the study. "

                "Operation Biting was one of the most thrilling British commando raids of World War II, and probably the most successful. In February 1942 RAF intelligence was baffled by a newly-identified radar network on the coast of Nazi-occupied Europe, codenamed W\u00fcrzburg. The brilliant scientist Dr RV Jones proposed an assault to capture key components. The nearest accessible enemy set stood upon a steep cliff at Bruneval in Normandy. Winston Churchill enthused, as did Lord Louis Mountbatten, chief of Combined Operations. A company of the newly-formed Airborne Forces was committed to the operation, which took place on the night of 27/28 February. Amid heavy snow 120 men landed, some of whom were misdropped almost two miles from their objective. They nonetheless launched the assault, dismantled the German radar, and after three nail-biting hours in France and a fierce battle with Wehrmacht defenders, escaped in the nick of time by landing-craft across stormy seas to Portsmouth. Max Hastings recounts this cliffhanging tale in a wealth of previously unchronicled detail. He portrays its remarkable personalities: the 'boffin' RV Jones; the peacock Mountbatten; the troubled husband of Daphne Du Maurier, Gen. 'Boy' Browning, who commanded the Airborne Division; 'Colonel Remy', the French secret agent whose men reconnoitered Bruneval at mortal risk; Major John Frost, who led the paras into action; Charlie Cox, the little RAF technician who stripped the W\u00fcrzburg and became an unexpected hero; Wing-Commander Charles Pickard, a legendary bomber pilot who led the drop squadron. Seldom have so many fascinating personalities been brought together to fulfil a mission that became a front-page triumph in a season of British defeats. Recounted in Hastings' familiar best-selling blend of top-down and bottom-up action detail, Operation Biting tells a story that has become almost forgotten yet deserves to rank among the epic tales of courage and daring that took place in the greatest conflict in history.

                "The Number One Bestseller  ______________  For over thirty years, David McDonald worked in Ireland's biggest prisons. This is his story.  As a young officer, McDonald got a baptism of fire in Mountjoy. In 1989 it was a chaotic, pungent and overcrowded place, and the approach to keeping order was primitive. Returning to his hometown two years later, he entered Portlaoise Prison, which - due to the presence of IRA and other subversive prisoners - was then the most secure prison in Europe. McDonald was amazed to discover the power of these subversives within the prison. Portlaoise, and later the new Midlands Prison, were also where Ireland's emerging class of serious gangsters were housed. McDonald dealt with notorious household names like John Gilligan, Christy Kinahan, Brian Meehan, Dessie O'Hare and, more recently, killers like Graham Dwyer, in his average working day. McDonald shares vivid accounts of the constant war of attrition between prisoners and prison authorities over the smuggling of contraband like drugs and phones. His work in a specialist security unit trying to stop this trafficking sometimes brought him into conflict with his bosses. He also questioned aspects of an often brutal and under-resourced system. Ultimately, concerns about poor handling of key issues led to him becoming a whistle-blower. In  Unlocked , McDonald brilliantly describes the boredom, the constant tension and flashpoints of extreme violence, and the moments of comedy, tragedy and surprising humanity that are part and parcel of working in prisons. Written with the help of award-winning journalist and author, Mick Clifford, it is a jaw-dropping and authentic account of life in the toughest of workplaces. _____________ 'An extraordinary behind-the-scenes look at the hidden world of Irish prisoners . . . fascinating' Brendan O'Connor 'Cracking' Matt Cooper.

Sunday Times    'Absolutely superb. 5 stars for sheer readability alone. Her Honour entertains as she educates us about murder, about the law and about how we human beings are shaped as we create the culture we live with.'   PHILIPPA PERRY, author of THE BOOK YOU WISH YOUR PARENTS HAD READ   ___________________________________________________________________________________    'Every day in the UK lives are suddenly, brutally, wickedly taken away. Victims are shot or stabbed. Less often they are strangled or suffocated or beaten to death. Rarely they are poisoned, pushed off high buildings, drowned or set alight. Then there are the many who are killed by dangerous drivers, or corporate gross negligence. There are a lot of ways you can kill someone. I know because I've seen most of them at close quarters.'   High-profile murder cases all too often grab our attention in dramatic media headlines - for every unlawful death tells a story. But, unlike most of us, a judge doesn't get to turn the page and move on. Nor does the defendant, or the family of the victim, nor the many other people who populate the court room. And yet, each of us has a vested interest in what happens there. And while most people have only the sketchiest idea of what happens inside a Crown Court, any one of us could end up in the witness-box or even in the dock. With breath-taking skill and deep compassion, the author describes how cases unfold and illustrates exactly what it's like to be a murder trial judge and a witness to human good and bad. Sometimes very bad. The fracture lines that run through our society are becoming harder and harder to ignore. From a unique vantage point, the author warns that we do so at our peril. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 'The most exceptional book I have read in a long time.'  CLARE MACKINTOSH  'A very rare gem. written with authority, humility and compassion. Compellingly clever and sharply honest.'  PROFESSOR DAME SUE BLACK, author of ALL THAT REMAINS  'Riveting, thought-provoking, and very, very entertaining. I loved it.'

                "In the second volume of the Police Diaries series,  Khaki on Broken Wings , former director general of police Amod K. Kanth untangles some of the most sensational and heinous crimes that dominated national headlines. Deploying his deep knowledge of real world crimes committed by the rich and the powerful, Kanth lays bare the loopholes within the criminal justice system, comprising the police, whose investigations are crucial to any prosecution, the courts and lawyers, and the prison and correctional services, which they exploit ruthlessly.  Among the many gripping stories Kanth narrates is the story of the mafia lord Romesh Sharma, who terrorised his targets to extort properties worth hundreds of crores and thwarted investigations using his access to powerful people in the political and corporate world. He also recounts how 'Bikini Killer' Charles Sobhraj managed a sensational escape from the high-security Tihar Jail in Delhi and the complex story behind the fight for justice in the BMW hit-and-run case that left several people dead.  Kanth passionately argues for the radical restructuring of the criminal justice system so that the police and the justice system are able to protect the poor, the needy and the helpless instead of being subservient to the rich and the powerful.

                "SOON TO BE THE MAJOR MOTION PICTURE  PAIN HUSTLERS  STARRING EMILY BLUNT AND CHRIS EVANS   'A pacey crime caper set against the backdrop of the opioid crisis . . . When I tell you that reading  The Hard Sell  is like watching a Scorsese film, you will assume I am exaggerating. Pick it up and tell me I'm wrong.' - Patrick Radden Keefe,  The New York Times   In the early 2000s, John Kapoor had already amassed a small fortune in pharmaceuticals when he founded Insys Therapeutics. A boom time for painkillers, he had developed a novel formulation of fentanyl, the most potent opioid on the market. Kapoor, a brilliant scientist with relentless business instincts, was eager to make the most of his innovation. But there was a problem: the drug was a niche product, approved only for cancer patients in dire condition. So he recruited an avaricious team, who employed a variety of deceptive techniques, such as zeroing in on suspect doctors, falsifying patient records and deceiving insurance companies. Insys became a Wall Street sensation. That is, until insiders reached their breaking point and blew the whistle, sparking a sprawling investigation in the government's fight to hold the drug industry accountable in the spread of addictive opioids. With colourful characters and true suspense,  The Hard Sell  lays bare the pharma playbook. Evan Hughes offers a bracing look not just at Insys, but at how opioids are sold at the point they first enter the national bloodstream \u2013 in the doctor's office. "

                "A real-life murder mystery in turn-of-the-century London, and Scotland Yard's \"greatest detective of all time\" who was determined to discover whodunit.     By 1919, Det. Chief Inspector Fred Wensley was already a legend, having investigated the Jack the Ripper slayings, busted crime syndicates, and risked his life at the notorious Siege of Sidney Street. But the brutal murder of kindly fifty-four-year-old widow and shopkeeper Elizabeth Ridgley was an unexpected challenge in a storied career.    Elizabeth and her dog were both found dead in her blood-spattered shop in Hitchin. But even in the early days of forensics, Wensley was stunned by the inept conclusion of local Hertfordshire police: it was a freak, tragic accident that had somehow felled Elizabeth and her Irish terrier. At Wensley's urging, Scotland Yard proceeded with a second investigation. It led to the arrest of an Irish war veteran. The only real evidence: a blood-stained shirt. But the Ridgley case was far from over.    Drawing on primary sources and newly-discovered material, Paul Stickler exposes the frailties of county policing in the years after WWI, reveals how Ridgley's murder led to fundamental changes in methods of investigation, and attempts to solve a seemingly unsolvable crime.

And it reveals how, one by one, each of the Wilsons was put out of business.  The Hitmen  draws on exclusive access to wire taps, case files and interviews with sources close to the gang who have never spoken before. No 1 bestselling authors Stephen Breen and Owen Conlon have written an extraordinary account of a family business like no other. "

                "David Teale: groomed by the twins, controlled by threats, falsely imprisoned by the State for his 'own protection' as younger brother of Kray-informer Bobby. Turns out that's only half the story.  David first met the Krays when he was seventeen years old. He was drawn into London's underworld, and became Ronnie's reluctant foot soldier, driver, errand boy. He was close to murder, and witnessed menaces and the increasingly psychotic behaviour of the most feared men in gangster land. Unbeknown to David, his brother Bobby had bravely turned informer at great risk to his own safety and that of his brothers. That had its own consequences. But why, when the police were being furnished with eye-witness statements, from an impeccable source, were they seemingly incapable of bringing the twins to justice? The Krays were untouchable. After tireless research through newly released documents in the National Archives, and piecing previously classified information together with his own, first-hand knowledge of the time, David Teale uncovers the shocking new truth, revealed in this book for the first time. David's story rewrites history. "

Taking place nine years earlier than the Road Hill case, made famous by the best-selling book The Suspicions of Mr Whicher and subsequent television adaptation, The Awful Killing of Sarah Watts: A Story of Confessions, Acquittals and Jailbreaks recounts the shocking details of this 1851 murder, on an isolated farm near Frome, and the incredible events that transpired from it. On Wednesday 24th September 1851, with her parents at market, Sarah Watts was alone at Battle Farm. Sometime during the afternoon, an intruder battered, raped and brutally murdered her. As the case gripped the nation, a London Detective was sent to investigate. The result was three local men \u2013 all notorious felons with previous convictions \u2013 were arrested and charged; but with a huge reward on offer, were they really guilty or just hapless victims of others' greed? When they did stand trial, it set in motion a series of riveting events that culminated a decade later in a sensational confession; but was this confessor\u2019s sanity to be questioned and were they even in the country at the time of the murder? For the very first time, this sensational story is told in full-length book form, with the authors having meticulously researched newspaper accounts, court transcripts, prison records and eyewitness accounts.

                "This true crime history examines the media frenzy surrounding Jack the Ripper\u2014and what the so-called Ripper Letters reveal about Victorian society.     In the autumn of 1888, a series of grisly murders took place in Whitechapel in London's East End. The Whitechapel murderer, arguably the first of his kind, was never caught, though the police and local press received hundreds of letters claiming to be from the killer. Though most if not all of these letters were hoaxes, they gave rise to the best known pen-name in criminal history: Jack the Ripper.    Some letters were taken more seriously than others, while a few\u2014such as the infamous \"Dear Boss\" letter\u2014sent thousands on a hunt to follow its clues. This book is not about the world's first serial killer but about the twisted souls who played the part on paper, implicated innocent men, or suggested ever more lurid ways in which he could be caught. For true crime historian M.J. Trow, these letters offer a window into the disturbing shadows of the Victorian mind. "

                "Victims of rape and torture experience a forced intimacy with their violators that may be exaggerated, unveiled, or obscured in the act of representation. Focusing on acts of \"intimate violence\" and their fictional representations, this study explores the disturbing dynamics that propel readers into intimate contact with the power of the rapist or the vulnerability of the victim. Using such notorious works as D.M. Thomas's The White Hotel, Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, and Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho, as well as novels by William Faulkner, George Orwell, Gloria Naylor, and Louise Erdrich, Intimate Violence offers a theory of reading violation that emphasizes the reader's status as negotiator between the conventions of representation and the material dynamics of violence. Suspended between material and semiotic worlds, the reader in the scene of violence must adopt a position relative not only to victim and violator but to the attitudes about violation encoded in representation and experienced through reading. The reader may find the victim's body reduced to literary convention or unveiled with agonizing specificity, be swept up by the rhythms of the violator's force or experience the jarring disruptions of the victim's pain. Appropriating elements of diverse theoretical models, such as feminist film theory, Marxism, and theories of the body, Intimate Violence renders visible the way in which representations of violation may exaggerate the reader's disembodied status or, conversely, lend that reader a textual body which delimits his or her experience of the text.

Their target: the charismatic, globe-trotting con man Phil Kitzer, who was responsible for swindling (and spending) millions of dollars and who some called the world's greatest. One problem, the FBI under J Edgar Hoover didn't really do undercover operations or fraud investigations.  So they did it anyway, making it up as they went along.  As the young agents became entangled in Kitzer's outrageous schemes, meeting other members of Kitzer's crime syndicate and powerful politicians and businessmen he fooled at each stop, they also grew to respect him - even care for him. And Kitzer began to think of Wedick and Brennan like sons, schooling them in everything from writing bad checks to picking up women.   Chasing Phil  by journalist and author David Howard is the story of an incredible round the world manhunt, a charismatic conman and a friendship that changed crime forever. "

America watched in fascinated horror as the killers were tried and convicted. But the real questions went unanswered. How did Manson make his 'family' kill for him? What made these young men and women kill again and again with no trace of remorse? Did the murders continue even after Manson's imprisonment?

She became the last woman to be hanged in Britain, and her execution is the most notorious of hangman Albert Pierrepoint's 'duties'.   Despite Ruth's infamy, the story of her life has never been fully told. Often wilfully misinterpreted, the reality behind the headlines was buried by an avalanche of hearsay. But now, through new interviews and comprehensive research into previously unpublished sources, Carol Ann Lee examines the facts without agenda or sensation. A portrait of the era and an evocation of 1950s club life in all its seedy glamour,  A Fine Day for a Hanging  sets Ruth's gripping story firmly in its historical context in order to tell the truth about both her timeless crime and a punishment that was very much of its time.

                "Charles 'Lucky' Luciano was a vicious mobster who rose to become the multimillionaire king of the New York underworld. He was a legend - but also a fake master criminal without real power, his reputation manipulated and maintained by the government agents who had put him behind bars.     Drawing on secret government documents from archives in America and Europe, this myth-busting biography tells Luciano's real story, from his early days as a top hit man for the mob to his exploits running sex and narcotics empires and revelations about his trip to Nazi Germany to set up a drugs importing racket. His career abruptly halted by imprisonment, Luciano's reputation was enhanced by rumours that he was helping to win the Second World War for the Allies in Sicily and the Mediterranean. Through painstaking research, Newark exposes the truth about what Luciano really did during the war.    Expelled from the US in 1946, Luciano returned to Italy, where he was reputed to head a massive transatlantic narcotics network. In a complex conspiracy, he became a victim of the far greater powers around him, and Newark provides evidence that, at one time, he was even working as a Cold War agent, helping the US government fight Communism in Sicily. Lucky Luciano: Mafia Murderer and Secret Agent turns accepted Mafia history on its head with an extraordinary story that has never been told before. "

Hindley's later confession that she and Brady had lied in an attempt to reduce their sentences did little to diminish the slurs against his name.  For almost 45 years, Smith was asked by writers and film-makers to tell his story. Apart from a handful of brief interviews, he always refused. Carol Ann Lee met Smith during her research for  One of Your Own , her critically acclaimed biography of Hindley, following which he finally agreed to reveal all.  In  Witness , interviews, archival research and, most significantly, David Smith's own vivid memoir are fused to create an unforgettable, often harrowing account of his life before, during and after the Moors Murders.

Lee ChildIn a true crime cross between James Ellroy and David Simon's The Wire, A Good Month for Murder follows twelve homicides, three police-involved shootings and the furious hunt for an especially brutal killer in Washington D.C. After gaining unparalleled access to the homicide unit in Prince George's County, which borders the nation's capital, bestselling author Del Quentin Wilber begins shadowing the talented, often quirky detectives who get the call when a body falls. After a quiet couple of months, all hell breaks loose: suddenly every detective in the squad is scrambling to solve one shooting and stabbing after another. Meanwhile, the entire unit is obsessed with a stone-cold 'red ball', a high-profile case involving a seventeen-year-old honour student attacked by a gunman who kicked down the door to her house and shot her in her bed. This is the inside story of how a team of detectives carry out their almost impossible job.Murder is the police investigator's ultimate crucible: to solve a killing, a detective must speak for the dead. A Good Month for Murder is a compelling true crime account which shows what it takes to succeed when the stakes couldn't possibly be higher. "

The dirty bankers and businessmen he befriended knew him as Bob Musella, a wealthy, mob-connected big shot living the good life. Together they partied in expensive hotels, drank the world's finest champagnes, drove Rolls-Royce convertibles and flew in private jets. But under Mazur's designer suits and hidden away in his quality briefcase, recorders whirred quietly, capturing the damning evidence of their crimes. Then, at his own staged wedding, he led a dramatic takedown that shook the underworld. In the end, more than eighty men and women were charged worldwide. Operation C-Chase became one of the most successful undercover operations in the history of US law enforcement, and evidence gathered during the bust proved critical to the conviction of General Manuel Noriega.The Infiltrator is the true story of how Mazur's undercover work helped bring down the unscrupulous bankers who manipulated complex international finance systems to serve drug lords - including Pablo Escobar and the infamous Medillin cartel - corrupt politicians, tax cheats and terrorists. It is a shocking chronicle of the rise and fall of perhaps the biggest and most intricate money-laundering operation of all time. And, at its heart, it's a vivid portrait of an undercover life and the sacrifices it requires.Filled with dangerous lies, near misses and harrowing escapes,  The Infiltrator is as bracing and explosive as the greatest fiction thrillers - only it's all true.

When Silvano Iurata's troubled brother, Noonie, rumored to be living in Brooklyn Heights, goes missing, Silvano returns to a place he swore he'd never set foot in again. Silvano left Brooklyn a long time ago -- wanting to leave behind his family and their seedy mob connections, and a past that just won't stay buried. The jungles of Viet Nam felt more hospitable to him than his own hometown; now that he's back, he doesn't intend to stay for long. His cousin Domenic has harbored a deadly grudge against him for something that happened when they were teenagers, but they aren't kids anymore, and his cousin has some dangerous friends. Silvano needs to find out what happened to his brother and get out -- fast. "

                "Victims of rape and torture experience a forced intimacy with their violators that may be exaggerated, unveiled, or obscured in the act of representation. Focusing on acts of \"intimate violence\" and their fictional representations, this study explores the disturbing dynamics that propel readers into intimate contact with the power of the rapist or the vulnerability of the victim. Using such notorious works as D.M. Thomas's The White Hotel, Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, and Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho, as well as novels by William Faulkner, George Orwell, Gloria Naylor, and Louise Erdrich, Intimate Violence offers a theory of reading violation that emphasizes the reader's status as negotiator between the conventions of representation and the material dynamics of violence. Suspended between material and semiotic worlds, the reader in the scene of violence must adopt a position relative not only to victim and violator but to the attitudes about violation encoded in representation and experienced through reading. The reader may find the victim's body reduced to literary convention or unveiled with agonizing specificity, be swept up by the rhythms of the violator's force or experience the jarring disruptions of the victim's pain. Appropriating elements of diverse theoretical models, such as feminist film theory, Marxism, and theories of the body, Intimate Violence renders visible the way in which representations of violation may exaggerate the reader's disembodied status or, conversely, lend that reader a textual body which delimits his or her experience of the text.

A turf war between two biker gangs has erupted, turning the streets of a peaceful city into scenes of Hollywood-style assassinations, explosions, and motorcades to killed gangsters\u00bf funerals. Public outcry, police pressure, media, and politicians seem helpless to curb the violence. In the midst of this turmoil, Claude, an ambitious criminal and sadist, is hired by the Devil\u00bfs Knights gang leader, Marcel, for the most hideous job: murder. His hits, thoroughly contemplated and executed, with no evidence left, make large headlines in the local media. Obsessed with revenge against his foe Stanley, one of the rival gang leaders, Claude presses his luck too much in trying to kill this sophisticated gangster. His love affair with Leila, a young and adventurous woman from a middle-class family, complicates his life even more. The methodical, relentless pursuit of police after him and his bosses brings fruit. Arrested at the crime scene, Claude faces tough choices: death as punishment from the rival gang, death from his own \u00bfbrothers,\u00bf or life in prison. In his desperate attempts to find his way out of a death trap, he stretches the limits of gangsters\u00bf ethics and pays dearly for that. "

                "Former pop star Heather Wells has settled nicely into her new life as assistant dorm director at New York College--a career that does not require her to drape her size 12 body in embarrassingly skimpy outfits. She can even cope (sort of) with her rocker ex-boyfriend's upcoming nuptials, which the press has dubbed The Celebrity Wedding of the Decade. But she's definitely having a hard time dealing with the situation in the dormitory kitchen--where a cheerleader has lost her head on the first day of the semester. (Actually, her head is accounted for--it's her torso that's AWOL.) Surrounded by hysterical students--with her ex-con father on her doorstep and her ex-love bombarding her with unwanted phone calls--Heather welcomes the opportunity to play detective ... again. If it gets her mind off her personal problems--and teams her up again with the gorgeous P.I. who owns the brownstone where she lives--it's all good ... "

Then a beautiful young woman is found raped and savagely murdered on the altar steps of an ancient church near Westminster Abbey. A dueling pistol discovered at the scene and the damning testimony of a witness both point to one man, Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, a brilliant young nobleman shattered by his experience in the Napoleonic Wars. Now a fugitive running for his life, Sebastian calls upon his skill as an agent during the war to catch the killer and prove his own innocence. In the process, he accumulates a band of unlikely allies, including the enigmatic beauty Kat Boleyn, who broke Sebastian's heart years ago. In Sebastian's world of intrigue and espionage, nothing is as it seems, yet the truth may hold the key to the future of the British monarchy, as well as to Sebastian's own salvation. "

                "This history of the US's British aircraft acquisition \"examin[es] the role [the USSAF] played in reconnaissance, special operations, and night fighting.\" \u2014 Air & Space Power History    On 20 April 1941, a group of distinguished Americans visited the de Havilland Aircraft Company's airfield at Hatfield, England. The party was there ostensibly to gain an insight into how various US aircraft supplied to Britain were performing, as well as to observe some of the latest British products being put through their paces. The eighteen types on display included both US and British bombers and fighters. But the star of the day was undoubtedly the de Havilland Mosquito. Having first flown only a few months earlier, the aircraft was demonstrated by none other than Geoffrey de Havilland. Striving to impress the trans-Atlantic visitors, de Havilland provided an outstanding display of speed and manoeuvrability. It was a routine that left the Americans in no doubt as to the Mosquito's abilities. Following America's entry into WWII, formal requests for Mosquitoes began in earnest. A steady flow of the photographic reconnaissance version were provided to what would become the USAAF's 25th Bomb Group at Watton, England. There they served with distinction in a variety of specialist roles. A number of these Mosquitoes served with the 492nd Bomb Group at Harrington and were involved in the so-called \"Joan-Eleanor\" project. Finally, in 1945, the USAAF received much-anticipated night fighter Mosquitoes which enjoyed combat success with the 416th Night Fighter Squadron in Italy. In this highly illustrated work, the author explores the full story of why the Americans wanted Mosquitoes, how they went about obtaining them, and their noted success and popularity with USAAF units.
