The essays explore the regional settlement pattern arising from Adityavarman's highland interregnum and attempt to place the archaeological remains and the landscape of Tanah Datar in a cultural historic synthesis. The book consists of studies of metal, ceramics and glass finds by laboratory-based specialists and descriptions of stone, clay and other finds."

                "The ancient ruins of Southeast Asia have long sparked curiosity and romance in the world's imagination. They appear in accounts of nineteenth-century French explorers, as props for Indiana Jones' adventures, and more recently as the scene of Lady Lara Croft's fantastical battle with the forces of evil. They have been featured in National Geographic magazine and serve as backdrops for popular television travel and reality shows. Now William Chapman's expansive new study explores the varied roles these monumental remains have played in the histories of Southeast Asia's modern nations. Based on more than fifteen years of travel, research, and visits to hundreds of ancient sites, A Heritage of Ruins shows the close connection between \"ruins conservation\" and both colonialism and nation building. It also demonstrates the profound impact of European-derived ideas of historic and aesthetic significance on ancient ruins and how these continue to color the management and presentation of sites in Southeast Asia today. Angkor, Pagan (Bagan), Borobudur, and Ayutthaya lie at the center of this cultural and architectural tour, but less visited sites, including Laos's stunning Vat Phu, the small temple platforms of Malaysia's Lembah Bujang Valley, the candi of the Dieng Plateau in Java, and the ruins of Mingun in Burma and Wiang Kum Kam near Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, are also discussed. All share a relative isolation from modern urban centers of population, sitting in park-like settings, serving as objects of tourism and as lynchpins for local and even national economies. Chapman argues that these sites also remain important to surrounding residents, both as a means of income and as continuing sources of spiritual meaning. He examines the complexities of heritage efforts in the context of present-day expectations by focusing on the roles of both outside and indigenous experts in conservation and management and on attempts by local populations to reclaim their patrimony and play a larger role in protection and interpretation. Tracing the history of interventions aimed at halting time's decay, Chapman provides a chronicle of conservation efforts over a century and a half, highlighting the significant part foreign expertise has played in the region and the ways that national programs have, in recent years, begun to break from earlier models. The book ends with suggestions for how Southeast Asian managers and officials might best protect their incomparable heritage of art and architecture and how this legacy might be preserved for future generations.

The photographs gathered by the authors represent subjects including the methamphetamine known as Pervitin, Hitler's Mercedes, jackboots, concentration camp badges, a 1932 election poster, Wehrmacht mittens, Hitler's grooming kit, the Tiger Tank, fragments of flak, and, of course, the swastika and  Mein Kampf , among dozens more\u2014along with informative text that sheds new light on both the objects themselves and the history they represent.

                "The landing craft assault or LCA was one of the unsung heroes of the Second World War. It took part in practically every amphibious operation from Norway to Normandy and landed around 400,000 men in action conditions, plus many more in training. It was the only serviceable British landing craft at the beginning of the War, and it remained in service until the Suez operation of 1956. It landed the first waves of infantry on the British and Canadian beaches in Normandy in 1944, and Americans on the notorious Omaha Beach. Its far-sighted design of 1938 remains the basis for the landing craft of today.This is the first book devoted to this humble but essential craft. It examines its design history before the War, when amphibious operations were deeply unfashionable. It describes its design and construction with plans that will be useful to modellers and wargamers. It includes information on the role of the crew and the techniques and tactics used in landings. It gives an account of the larger ships which carried it and the life of the sailors and soldiers who travelled in it, with many vivid personal accounts. Finally, it describes its role in the many operations in which it took part, including withdrawals such as Dunkirk and the catastrophic Dieppe raid of 1942. "

                "A charmingly illustrated history of midcentury instructional records and their untold contribution to the American narrative of self-improvement, aspiration, and success.  For the midcentury Americans who wished to better their golf game through hypnosis, teach their parakeet to talk, or achieve sexual harmony in their marriage, the answers lay no further than the record player. In  Designed for Success , Janet Borgerson and Jonathan Schroeder shed light on these endearingly earnest albums that contributed to a powerful American vision of personal success. Rescued from charity shops, record store cast-off bins, or forgotten boxes in attics and basements, these educational records reveal the American consumers\u2019 rich but sometimes surprising relationship to advertising, self-help, identity construction, and even aspects of transcendentalist thought. Relegated to obscurity and novelty, instructional records such as  Secrets of Successful Varmint Calling, You Be a Disc Jockey , and  How to Ski (A Living-Room Guide for Beginners)  offer distinct insights into midcentury media production and consumption. Tracing the history of instructional records from the inception of the recording industry to the height of their popularity, Borgerson and Schroeder offer close readings of the abundant topics covered by \u201cdesigned for success\u201d records. Complemented by over a hundred full-color illustrations,  Designed for Success  is a wonderfully nostalgic tour that showcases the essential role these vinyl records played as an unappreciated precursor to contemporary do-it-yourself culture and modern conceptions of self-improvement.

                "After ten years of production, the Solihull-manufactured Land Rover was established as a useful 4x4, popular with farmers, armies, and those whose employment took them far from the beaten track. Following a redesign, the Series II Land Rover was launched in April 1958. It was available in two wheelbases, with a choice of diesel or petrol engines and a variety of body styles including pick-ups and soft-tops and, aimed more at travel and people-carrying rather than agricultural work, short and long wheelbase Station Wagons. The main difference that identified the new Land Rovers at a glance was the radius pressed into the aluminium bodywork below the galvanized waist rail. This changed the Land Rover's appearance considerably and was a shape that endured until 2016 in the Land Rover Defender. The Series IIA was introduced in 1961 and through a production run that last until 1971, a succession of upgrades, mainly detail and cosmetic changes, followed. The distinctive Station Wagon models \u2013 unofficially referred to as 'Safari' models \u2013 became popular with overland travelers and were often seen on location in TV nature programs, in National Geographic magazine and in the hands of aid agencies all of which promoted the Land Rover, which had most of the market to itself, especially in export markets such as Australasia and Africa.

                "Barbie is a strong, independent doll. But is she a feminist icon? It's complicated.    Since her introduction in 1959, Barbie's impact has been revolutionary. Far from being a toy designed by men to oppress women, she was a toy invented by women to teach women what was expected of them, for better or for worse. Whether tarred-and-glittered as antifeminist puffery or celebrated as a feminist icon (or, at any rate, an important cultural touchstone in understanding feminism) Barbie has undeniably influenced generations of girls.  In Forever Barbie, cultural critic, investigative journalist, and first-generation Barbie owner M. G. Lord uncovers the surprising story behind Barbie's smash success. Revealing her low origins as \"Bild Lilli,\" a risqu\u00e9 doll for adults sold as a gag gift in postwar Germany, Forever Barbie traces Barbie's development and transformation, through countless makeovers and career changes, into an international pop culture icon and now \"traditional toy.\" Though not every doll in the line has been a hit\u2014with pregnant Midge and Growing up Skipper among the more intriguing disasters\u2014Barbie's endurance, Lord writes, speaks as much to Mattel's successful marketing as it does to our society's overall ambivalence toward femininity.   With new accessories, including a preface on the latest developments in the Barbieverse, Forever Barbie \"will make you think of America's most celebrated plastic doll in ways you never have before\" (Susan Faludi).

From the early days of motoring, British innovators led the way, building some of the world\u2019s most famous motorcycles, as well as some of the best performers. At one point, the rest of the motorcycle world followed Britain\u2019s lead, and by the late 1950s, the British were by far the largest producers of motorcycles in the world. However, barely a decade later, the British motorcycle industry was almost bankrupt and in utter disarray. Illustrated with over 150 photographs, this book explores the rise and fall of the British motorcycle industry, looking at its history through the years and then at the motorcycles themselves by brand, giving the complete story of these amazing machines.

                "In the late 1970s, Robert Brunk discovered the world of auctioneering. Drawn to the unique mountain culture and the history of fine art in and around Asheville, North Carolina, Bob started a business, Brunk Auctions, that became part of a bustling network of commerce. America's passion for collecting, buying, and selling reached remarkable heights in the following decades. Auction houses and antiques stores thrived; people paid hundreds of dollars for a humble country basket and thousands for a rare piece of folk art.  In this collection of compelling, compassionate essays, Bob considers specific items and remarkable situations he encountered in his long and successful work as an auctioneer and appraiser. He presents objects as invitations to consider personal and collective histories often related to unresolved social inequities. Bob also describes how, as his business grew to offer the finest examples of American and European art, his career often conflicted with his Mennonite background and the complexities of ownership and value. The result is a portrait that reflects the best and worst of us as we search for ways to live with objects\u2014and then decide what to do when it's time to let them go. "

                "From building blocks to city blocks, an eye-opening exploration of how children's playthings and physical surroundings affect their development.  Parents obsess over their children's playdates, kindergarten curriculum, and every bump and bruise, but the toys, classrooms, playgrounds, and neighborhoods little ones engage with are just as important. These objects and spaces encode decades, even centuries of changing ideas about what makes for good child-rearing\u2014and what does not. Do you choose wooden toys, or plastic, or, increasingly, digital? What do youngsters lose when seesaws are deemed too dangerous and slides are designed primarily for safety? How can the built environment help children cultivate self-reliance? In these debates, parents, educators, and kids themselves are often caught in the middle. Now, prominent design critic Alexandra Lange reveals the surprising histories behind the human-made elements of our children's pint-size landscape. Her fascinating investigation shows how the seemingly innocuous universe of stuff affects kids' behavior, values, and health, often in subtle ways. And she reveals how years of decisions by toymakers, architects, and urban planners have helped\u2014and hindered\u2014American youngsters' journeys toward independence. Seen through Lange's eyes, everything from the sandbox to the street becomes vibrant with buried meaning.  The Design of Childhood  will change the way you view your children's world\u2014and your own. "

                "In a classic car photography book packed with an eclectic mix of automotive images, Lance Cole (author of the Classic Car Adventure) presents a stunning collection of photographs of old cars of all marques and types captured in many locations. Across Allards to Bugattis, Citro\u00ebns DKWs, Porsches, Saabs, Triumphs, Voisins, VWs, and a potpourri of well-known classics, the author has journeyed far and wide to create a wonderful diary of classic car moments amid the great enthusiasm for nostalgia on wheels. A mix of cars, people, portraits, action and atmosphere all blend in to a colorful journey across the classic car world in a diverse blend of marques and eras. 250 color and black and white images populate an odyssey across a landscape of cars in an interesting format that pitches multimillion pound cars alongside more humble names. Seen on the move and static, Lance Cole\u2019s photographs capture the essence of metal sculpture, light falling upon paint and form, and the design hallmarks of old cars prior to the age of digital design authoritarianism when so many cars look similar. If you love old metal, patina, paint, leather, and enthusiasm, all captured across vintage, veteran, classic and modern classic metal, then  Classic Car Gallery  is a rare memento of the cars of yesteryear seen in the celebration of their today.

                "A captivating and wonderfully illustrated chronicle of one of the most influential and legendary names in gunsmithing history.   John M. Browning was born in Ogden, Utah, in 1855, into a world of gunsmithing. His father was a gunsmith who was already well known for a number of innovations in the field. As a young boy, John spent hours in his father's shop and allegedly knew the name of every part of a gun before he could read. It's hardly surprising that at age twenty-three, he was filing his first patent for the \"J. M. Browning Single-Shot Rifle.\"   Browning inherited his father's gun making shop, and with funds of less than a thousand dollars, developed it into a highly successful business that developed several iconic firearms including the Colt Peacemaker. Browning also cooperated with Winchester to develop a whole range of small arms including semi-automatic pistols, single-shot rifles, repeater rifles, and machine guns. His enthusiasm and creativity have led many to believe he is the greatest firearm designer of all time.   This fascinating book describes the Browning history, and in addition to covering the full range of inventions and designs, also shows various gun-making artifacts, copies of designers' drawings, and interesting photographs of the weapons in the hands of users.   The History of Browning Firearms  makes a perfect addition to the libraries of Wild West buffs and firearms enthusiasts. "

                "\"Forty-thousand years of our relationship with time condensed into 288 pages: a hugely entertaining achievement.\" \u2013Esquire    \"As impeccably crafted and precisely engineered as any of the watches on which the author has worked so lovingly over the years, this book is a joy to behold and a wonder to enjoy.\" \u2013Simon Winchester, author of The Perfectionists and Land    An award-winning watchmaker\u2014one of the few practicing the art in the world today\u2014chronicles the invention of time through the centuries-long story of one of mankind's most profound technological achievements: the watch.   Timepieces have long accompanied us on our travels, from the depths of the oceans to the summit of Everest, the ice of the arctic to the sands of the deserts, outer space to the surface of the moon. The watch has sculpted the social and economic development of modern society; it is an object that, when disassembled, can give us new insights both into the motivations of inventors and craftsmen of the past, and, into the lives of the people who treasured them.  Hands of Time is a journey through watchmaking history, from the earliest attempts at time-keeping, to the breakthrough in engineering that gave us the first watch, to today \u2013 where the timepieces hold cultural and historical significance beyond what its first creators could have imagined. Acclaimed watchmaker Rebecca Struthers uses the most important watches throughout history to explore their attendant paradigm shifts in how we think about time, indeed how we think about our own humanity. From an up-close look at the birth of the fakes and forgeries industry which marked the watch as a valuable commodity, to the watches that helped us navigate trade expeditions, she reveals how these instruments have shaped how we build and then consequently make our way through the world.  A fusion of art and science, history and social commentary, this fascinating work, told in Struthers's lively voice and illustrated with custom line drawings by her husband and fellow watchmaker Craig, is filled with her personal observations as an expert watchmaker\u2014one of the few remaining at work in the world today. Horology is a vast subject\u2014the \"study of time.\" This compelling history offers a fresh take, exploring not only these watches within their time, but the role they played in human development and the impact they had on the people who treasured them.

Some years ago, Oliver Darkshire stepped into the hushed interior of Henry Sotheran Ltd on Sackville Street (est. 1761) to interview for their bookselling apprenticeship, a decision which has bedevilled him ever since. He'd intended to stay for a year before launching into some less dusty, better remunerated career. Unfortunately for him, the alluring smell of old books and the temptation of a management-approved afternoon nap proved irresistible. Soon he was balancing teetering stacks of first editions, fending off nonagenarian widows with a ten-foot pole and trying not to upset the store's resident ghost (the late Mr Sotheran had unfinished business when he was hit by that tram). For while Sotheran's might be a treasure trove of literary delights, it sings a siren song to eccentrics. There are not only colleagues whose tastes in rare items range from the inspired to the mildly dangerous, but also zealous collectors seeking knowledge, curios, or simply someone with whom to hold a four hour conversation about books bound in human skin. By turns unhinged and earnestly dog-eared,  Once Upon a Tome  is the rather colourful story of life in one of the world's oldest bookshops and a love letter to the benign, unruly world of antiquarian bookselling, where to be uncommon or strange is the best possible compliment.

                "This book provides a condensed, comprehensible, but complete overview of the history of Chinese porcelain.By studying the most notable characteristics of porcelain in different periods throughout history, it explores the evolution of the great kilns, and describes the influence of factors such as social and economic development, political change, and foreign cultures. Each one of these affected porcelain's shapes, uses, colors, styles, patterns, and other features in unique ways. An Illustrated Brief History of Chinese Porcelain explains the cultural implications and the aesthetic and philosophical concepts which underlie the porcelain we know today.The origins of Chinese porcelain lie as far back as the Shang (1600&#8211;1050BCE) and Zhou (1046&#8211;256BCE) dynasties. One of the treasures of Chinese civilization, porcelain was first fashioned in the five great kiln-sites at the beginning of the second millennium, then evolved to form the splendid blue-and-white of the Yuan, before reaching its apogee in the Ming (1368&#8211;1644AD) and Qing (1644&#8211;1912AD) dynasties.An Illustrated Brief History of Chinese Porcelain makes extensive use of archeological material from excavations at historic kilns and grave sites undertaken since 1949, as well as the results of new research. It presents readers with images of outstanding examples of different types of porcelain\u2014including celadon, blanc de Chine, famille rose, and blue-and-white ware. "

                "Author: Mick Walker. Italy has a reputation for style in all things, not least in motorcycles. The first pure-bred Italian motorcycles made their appearance at the beginning of the 20th century and included Bianchi, Borgo, Prinetti & Stucchi and Ferrera. By the 1920s these companies had been joined or replaced by a number of newer concerns. Then came the period of the pentarchia, comprising Benelli, Bianchi, Garelli, Gilera and Guzzi, who fought tooth and nail for a share of the market. The golden age of Italian motorcycling lasted until 1957 when the three largest and most successful teams, FB Mondial, Gilera and Guzzi announced their retirement from the sport. This improved the chances of marques such as MV Agusta, Bianchi, Benelli, Morini and Ducati who continued to fly the red, white and green flag of Italy with considerable success. Italy not only produced a host of world-beating machinery, but also a number of top riders including Carlo Ubbiali, Umberto Masetti, Tarquinio Provini, Libero Liberati and most notably Giacomo Agostini. Contents: Aermacchi, Aprilia, Benelli, Bianchi, Bimota, Cagiva, Ducati, Garelli, Gilera, Laverda, FB Mondial, Morbidelli, Moto Guzzi, Moto Morini, MV Agusta, Parilla, Paton & Rumi. A total of 256 fully illustrated pages. "

                "The ancient city of York has been closely associated with railways since their conception and promotion by the \u2018Railway King\u2019, George Hudson. Its impressive station and engine sheds have played host to the elite of East Coast Main Line traction as well as a wide variety of \u2018locals\u2019. The major stabling point of York North shed, coded 50A was home to a diverse collection of steam locomotives as well as welcoming visiting engines from the wider network. As such it attracted interest from enthusiasts not only of steam power but later on as an important diesel depot, finally closing but later to be reborn as the National Railway Museum. Constructed in 1877 it was the largest railway station in the world. Legendary expresses have called at the platforms under the imposing curved glass and iron roof, now a Grade II* listed building. Today\u2019s \u2018flyers\u2019 race between London and Edinburgh at speeds unheard of in steam days while cross-country services also bring visitors keen to explore York\u2019s historic and cultural heritage. Yet the sight and sound of steam traction is still a major attraction in this modern era, with crowds flocking to see preserved locomotives at the head of the trains which regularly grace these famous tracks. David Mather has brought together a collection of his images which represents York\u2019s railway heritage from its earliest days through to the present and which shows the city to be still justified in claiming the title \u2018Railway Centre\u2019.

                "Here's your beautifully photographed one-stop source for everything you ever wanted to know about the immensely popular classic Ford tractors.   First manufactured in 1917, Ford tractors (initially sold under the Fordson name, a contraction of Henry Ford & Son) were, thanks to mass production,  the first affordable and reliable machines that allowed small farmers to replace draft animals . Though manufacture was exclusive to Great Britain by the 1930s, Ford tractors returned stateside with a roar in 1939 with the  9N , which incorporated the hitch system of Irish engineer and inventor Harry Ferguson.  In this comprehensive addition to  Motorbooks' Complete Book Series , tractor historian Robert Pripps provides a detailed and complete account of Ford tractors, from the earliest  Fordsons  to the  Ford-Fergusons , the  Ford N Series , and the  Ford \"World\" tractors  manufactured into the 1970s. Amply illustrated, the book also offers extensive information on the numerous  options  and  accessories ,  implements  and  variations  that came out of Dearborn, Sherman Bros., and the great Funk Bros. hot rod conversions that could make each of these popular machines utterly unique. In between, the book traces  year-to-year model changes  within each series.  With content from Pripps' best-selling  The Big Book of Ford Tractors  and  The Illustrated Ford and Fordson Tractor Buyer's Guide ,  The Complete Book of Ford Tractors  is supplemented with  new text ,  data-packed specification boxes , and a largely new selection of  incredible color photography  and  period advertising .  The only book offering comprehensive coverage of the breadth of collectible Ford tractors,  The Complete Book of Ford Tractors  is a must-have volume for every tractor enthusiast's library.  Also available from the Complete Books series:  The Complete Book of Classic John Deere Tractors  and  The Complete Book of Farmall Tractors . "

Conceived to address needs long identified by the Costume Society of America, this guide is written for a broad spectrum of collection managers at museums, historical societies and houses, university theaters and study collections, and company archives, as well as for vintage dealers, private collectors, and living history performers. Drawing on the wisdom of many disciplines, Coffey-Webb takes a holistic approach to problem-solving, explaining appropriate procedures and the reasons behind them, to arm collection managers, specialists and nonspecialists alike, with sufficient tools to make informed decisions on their own. She also offers alternative solutions to the recommended guidelines. Although there are books on costume conservation, there is a paucity of 04 Activeable material on costume-collection management. Managing Costume Collections is the first work in collection management to address a wide audience, from general to academic and hobbyist to professional, interested specifically in costume. "

                "Batik occupies a special place in Indonesian culture. Each fabric has a rich story to tell\u2014as a reflection of the nation's religious beliefs, sophisticated court cultures and cosmopolitan history.   The extraordinary textiles in this book are from the collections of Rudolf Smend and Donald Harper. Most date from the period 1880 to 1930 when the art of batik reached its apogee. Having collected historical batik for over thirty years and published two books on the subject, Rudolf Smend has invited his friend and fellow batik specialist Donald Harper to contribute his fine collection to this publication as well. None of the batik in this book have been published before. They represent an exquisite cross-section of the batik production of Java\u2014the most important batik-producing region in the world.  The cloths are complemented by vintage photographs from the first quarter of the 20th century demonstrating how the batik were worn at court and at home. Three are from museums in Dresden and Cologne, while three are from the private collection of Leo Haks. The others have been collected over the past 30 years from private sources in Java. The captions are by Maria Wronska-Friend, an ethnologist and batik expert who frequently visits Indonesian batik centers and has worked for many years as an anthropologist in Papua New Guinea. Her contributions provide fundamental knowledge for lovers of this art form while at the same time providing new insights for experts.  Rudolf Smend has invited other batik aficionados of his generation to share their passion for batik in this book. Inger McCabe Elliott, author of the bestselling Batik: Fabled Cloth of Java has contributed her lifelong experience. Other authorities like Annegret Haake, Brigitte Khan Majlis and Jonathan Hope share their views and expertise in these pages. This book represents a labor of love and a lifetime of friendship for the two authors, who hope it will provide inspiration to a whole new generation of batik lovers. "

                "Poet, publisher, bookseller, activist\u2014this is the story of Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the bookshop he made a landmark in San Francisco, and a life beautifully lived with writers and books.  In the mid-1950s a group of San Francisco-based writers emerged as a central force in American letters. Self-styled bohemians, disillusioned with the old American dream of prosperity and conformity, they harangued these \"virtues\" in their writings. They became known as the Beat Generation. Their ranks included Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and Gregory Corso. But the unifying force among them was an unassuming, almost painfully shy young poet named Lawrence Ferlinghetti. As owner of the now legendary City Lights Booksellers and its publishing enterprises, City Lights Publishers and its Pocket Poet Series, Ferlinghetti promoted the writings of his rebellious contemporaries, and continually looked for new talent to publish, while conducting a parallel though more personal search for self-identity through his own work. Although that search began with a lonely, unstable childhood in which he never knew his real parents, it would not become manifest until years later with the 1958 publication of his first collection of poems,  A Coney Island of the Mind \u2014that debut would go on to sell more than one million copies and become one of the bestselling and most popular books of poetry ever published.  In this, the first biography ever published of Ferlinghetti (originally released in 1979), Neeli Cherkovski recreated those early years of the poet-publisher and examined the content and import of his work. Long out-of-print, this is a crucial literary document by a man who knew the legendary poet-publisher-bookseller intimately. This expanded edition of  Ferlinghetti: A Biography \u2014published just one year after Ferlinghetti's passing in 2021 at the age of 101\u2014includes a fascinating, hilarious new foreword about how the book came to be written in the late 1970s, an epilogue covering the last forty years of Ferlinghetti's life, and a personal, tender afterword about the long relationship between the author and his subject. For readers interested in American culture and how a business can make social change, this is an irresistible story of a long life very well lived. ",

These beautiful and intricate bed ornaments bear testament to their unique existence throughout the Straits of Malacca, Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar. A collection like this leaves us with the rich imagination of a lavish tribe.The collection in this book has given many insights into the past.

Advertising has changed over the decades\u2014and that is a major understatement. Despite the nostalgia of such shows as  Mad Men , the outrageous images in  Outdated Advertising  show readers just how far we've come since then. This outrageous collection of inappropriate ads will have you turning the pages and shaking your head in disbelief. It features ads from the mid-1850s through the 1980s, many of which have become notorious for their sexist, racist, politically incorrect, or other wildly inappropriate content\u2014or for just plain bad taste. Among the dozens of full-color examples, readers will find a woman being spanked by her husband for not buying the right coffee; the story of a mother having to turn her child over to an orphanage because her late husband didn't keep up his life insurance payments; Aunt Jemima declaring \"Happy days is here!\" because of her new pancake recipe; doctors promoting particular brands of cigarettes; and the Michael Jackson and Rainbow Brite portable record players with the copy line, \"Gifts to keep children singing.\" "

Blessed with a virtuoso palate, and with a seemingly limitless supply of coveted bottles, Kurniawan quickly became the leading purveyor of rare wines to the American elite. But in April 2008, at a New York auction house, dozens of Kurniawan's trophy bottles were abruptly pulled from sale.  Journalist Peter Hellman was there, and he began to investigate: Were the bottles fake? Were there others? And was Kurniawan himself duped by forgery...or had he ensnared the world's top winemakers, sellers, and drinkers in a web of deceit?. "

                "First published in the 1860s, Harry Johnson's \"Bartenders' Manual\" is part of the classic bar-books and one of its oldest exemplar. The author has been one of the first bartenders who not only had general and wise thoughts about his profession, he also commited his experiences and opinions to paper and wrote a teaching book for beginners and professionals. Doing this, he layed the foundation for following generations and stands beside Jerry Thomas at the beginning of a long list of famous bartenders. In his book Harry Johnson carries the reader into times where it was obviously necessary to remind bartenders not to chew on a toothpick or a cigar when on a job interview, not to spit on the floor or pursue other bad habits. He gives advise how to conduct a bar as well as how to treat employees and guests, how to handle beer-casks and wine-bottles, what stock is needed in a bar or restaurant, how to keep the business books and much more. The second half of the book contains recipes for cocktails, punches, bowls and other drinks famous in USA and Europe during this time. There you can also find the presumably first mention of the Martini cocktail as well as instruction of how to mix absinth and chill champagne. The Bartenders' Manual is not only a window to the past, it also shows how professional some bartenders of that time pursued their business - a fact we almost forget or ignore as we connect the USA of the 19. century with dusty saloons and dirty beer-glasses. Some parts of the book may seem out of date (who is still using blocks of ice or keeps guspidors for his guests?) but it is still a must-have for professionals and enthusiastic hobby-barkeepers and gives precious insights of the beginning of bar-culture.

                "Anthony Tucker-Jones's photographic history is a fascinating visual introduction to the armoured battles of the Second World War in the Far East and Asia-Pacific regions, from 1937 to 1945. In contrast to the experience of the armies that fought in Europe and North Africa, in the Far East tanks remained an infantry support weapon, and their role is often neglected in histories of the conflict. Japanese armour confronted tanks deployed by the Chinese, Russians, British and Americans. Early in the war, against Chinese forces which lacked armour, the Japanese had some success, but their light and medium tanks were no match for their Allied counterparts. Later Japanese designs were better armed, but they were built in such small numbers that they could do little to stem the Allied advance. The role of armoured vehicles in each theatre of the war in the Far East is shown in a selection of over 150 rare wartime photographs that record armour in action in China, Manchuria, Mongolia, Malaya, Burma and during the battles fought for the Pacific islands.

                "How has a game brought together Americans and defined separate ethnic communities? This book tells the first history of mahjong and its meaning in American culture.  Click-click-click. The sound of mahjong tiles connects American expatriates in Shanghai, Jazz Age white Americans, urban Chinese Americans in the 1930s, incarcerated Japanese Americans in wartime, Jewish American suburban mothers, and Air Force officers' wives in the postwar era. Mahjong: A Chinese Game and the Making of Modern American Culture illustrates how the spaces between tiles and the moments between games have fostered distinct social cultures in the United States. This mass-produced game crossed the Pacific, creating waves of popularity over the twentieth century. Annelise Heinz narrates the history of this game to show how it has created a variety of meanings, among them American modernity, Chinese American heritage, and Jewish American women's culture. As it traveled from China to the United States and caught on with Hollywood starlets, high society, middle-class housewives, and immigrants alike, mahjong became a quintessentially American game. Heinz also reveals the ways in which women leveraged a game to gain access to respectable leisure. The result was the forging of friendships that lasted decades and the creation of organizations that raised funds for the war effort and philanthropy. No other game has signified both belonging and standing apart in American culture. Drawing on photographs, advertising, popular media, and dozens of oral histories, Heinz's rich and colorful account offers the first history of the wildly popular game of mahjong. "

                "A wry, unvarnished chronicle of a career in the rare book trade during its last Golden Age   When Gary Goodman wandered into a run-down, used-book shop that was going out of business in East St. Paul in 1982, he had no idea the visit would change his life. He walked in as a psychiatric counselor and walked out as the store's new owner. In  The Last Bookseller  Goodman describes his sometimes desperate, sometimes hilarious career as a used and rare book dealer in Minnesota\u2014the early struggles, the travels to estate sales and book fairs, the remarkable finds, and the bibliophiles, forgers, book thieves, and book hoarders he met along the way.   Here we meet the infamous St. Paul Book Bandit, Stephen Blumberg, who stole 24,000 rare books worth more than fifty million dollars; John Jenkins, the Texas rare book dealer who (probably) was murdered while standing in the middle of the Colorado River; and the eccentric Melvin McCosh, who filled his dilapidated Lake Minnetonka mansion with half a million books. In 1990, with a couple of partners, Goodman opened St. Croix Antiquarian Books in Stillwater, one of the Twin Cities region's most venerable bookshops until it closed in 2017. This store became so successful and inspired so many other booksellers to move to town that Richard Booth, founder of the \"book town\" movement in Hay-on-Wye in Wales, declared Stillwater the First Book Town in North America.   The internet changed the book business forever, and Goodman details how, after 2000, the internet made stores like his obsolete. In the 1990s, the Twin Cities had nearly fifty secondhand bookshops; today, there are fewer than ten. As both a memoir and a history of booksellers and book scouts, criminals and collectors,  The Last Bookseller  offers an ultimately poignant account of the used and rare book business during its final Golden Age.

Its evolution since ancient times was driven not only by the expanding use of materials available, but advances in technology. The understated elegance of Chinese aesthetics in arts and crafts, both functional and decorative, has in many ways influenced the development of the Chinese cultural identity, becoming emblematic of Chinese civilization in its worldwide dispersion. This concise history, complete and lucidly accessible, captures this millennia-old tradition, from the Neolithic Age to the late Qing when the last imperial reign unraveled, and the rise and evolution of its various forms, tracing the chronology of Chinese dynasties. Well researched and richly illustrated with more than 200 artefacts, it offers a fascinating journey through the evolution of Chinese aesthetics in the context of changing societies, reflecting the underlying qualities of the Chinese mind and a cultural heritage that endured uninterruptedly through millennia.

                "Creating E-books in epub format is very important to sell E-books in electronic book stores. Most publishing and distribution E-book stores will not accept the epub format document for E-book if it includes any warnings or errors when validated and that is a very big challenge to all authors. I devoted this book to evaluate some tools that can be used for creating, validating and editing E-books to be in proper Epub format without errors. Personally, I suggest the following guidelines for preparing E-book in Epub format.   Write the document in Microsoft word as .docx file. Make sure to properly setup the h1headings and h2 headings and h3 headings on each section of the document as these data are the most important data used by the Epub management software to convert the document to epub format.   Convert the Microsoft document to Epub format using Calibre E-book management software. Add all required metadata and the cover and also create a table of contents when converting the file.   Using any Epub reader, check if the layout of epub document according to the headings you made on the word document is good and comfortable to any reader.   Validate the epub document to see if it has errors and warnings using the website http://validator.idpf.org.   Then try to troubleshoot and identify the exact location of the errors detected by the epub validator on the epub document by tracing the code view of the epub document using Sigil epub editor. Then, modify the word document to eliminate the errors. And reconvert the word document to epub format using Calibre E-book management software. Validate the updated epub document for any errors again. This book contains the following sections: 1. Some online publishing and distribution stores 2. Epub Validators 3. Creation Epub file through online websites 4. Common software's to convert a file to Epub format 5. Converting document to Epub format using Calibre software 6. Editing Epub documents using Sigil Epub Editor. "
