                "The audiobook is read by the author, Sophie Williams, and features an exclusive interview with Charlotte Cowan, Head of People and Culture and Shakespeare's Globe. ' Every current and aspiring leader needs to read this book' - Helen Tupper & Sarah Ellis,  Sunday Times  bestselling authors of  The Squiggly Career  and  You Coach You  'Clever, brilliantly researched and vitally important' - Dawn O'Porter, bestselling author of  The Cows  and  Cat Lady    The Glass Cliff is a conversation about what happens when women break the rules, and break through The Glass Ceiling.  Have you ever wondered why there are so few success stories of women in business leadership? Or maybe you've wondered what life is really like on the other side of The Glass Ceiling? The world of work is supposedly changing, embracing diversity \u2013 yet are the opportunities we're giving to women  really  equal to those of men? Drawing on almost 20 years of research from around the world, The Glass Cliff phenomenon - whereby women are often only hired in leadership roles when a business is already underperforming, meaning their chances of success are limited before they ever even start in the role - is well established, but little known. Until now.  This  is the story of  The Glass Cliff : a story of a structural inequality disguising itself as the personal failures of women. When Sophie Williams gave her viral TED talk on the subject, she was subsequently flooded with accounts of confident, accomplished women who had taken what seemed like a dream leadership role only to quickly find themselves in a waking nightmare. Without the language to describe their experiences they had been left blaming themselves. But learning about The Glass Cliff enabled them to reframe and reexamine what they'd gone through. Once we understand The Glass Cliff \u2013 once we can stand together and face it head-first \u2013 we can start to unravel so many other false narratives about women's leadership experiences that just don't make sense without it. By understanding the phenomenon, and by telling one another about it, we can affect the conversation, empower one another to overcome societal bias and, ultimately, change the world of work for women forever.

From barrister Harriet Johnson, Enough lays bare the appalling status quo of abuse against women in our society, offering an irrefutable case for why change is needed in policing and justice. Most vitally, it also gives a manifesto for how to get there. With expertise, clear-sightedness and appropriate fury, this book helps us see where women are suffering \u2013 from homicide to domestic abuse to street harassment. It exposes the ways the criminal justice system lets women down \u2013 from officers failing to properly investigate to a lack of consequences when police behaviour is unacceptable, to backlogged courts and the realities of convincing a jury. Addressing misogyny is to everyone's benefit and the answers aren't simple. Enough is the call to arms we can \u2013 and must \u2013 all get behind. "

Wade United States.  Abortion touches all of our lives. While statistically nearly everyone knows someone who will receive an abortion in their lifetime, limiting narratives flatten our understanding and assumptions around abortion, while stigma and criminalization stifle discussion. What we lack are the language and tools to provide care and support to all of the members of our communities who receive abortions, before, during, and after them.   Now, Hannah Matthews\u2014abortion care worker, doula, journalist and essayist, and reproductive rights advocate\u2014breathes depth and nuance into the oversimplified narratives surrounding abortion, presenting an accessible guide to the emotional and physical realities of providing and supporting abortion care for our own communities. Featuring stories of real abortion experiences, including Matthews's own,  You or Someone You Love  offers a glimpse into the stunningly diverse landscape of abortion care across gender, race, and class lines, while illustrating how we can better support and protect the people who seek abortion in a country that increasingly promotes secrecy and shame.

Moving deftly between psychoanalysis from Freud to Winnicott, cultural visions of fathering from King Lear to Ivanka Trump, and issues from incest to MeToo, Angel probes the fraught bond of daughters and fathers, women and the patriarchal regime. What, she asks, is this discomfiting space of love and hate-and how are we to reckon with both fealty and rebellion? As in her earlier book Tomorrow Sex Will Be Good Again, Angel proves herself to be one of the most perceptive feminist writers at work today. "

                "How did we become so divided and what do we do about it? 'Analytically incisive yet infectiously optimistic, Fractured expertly diagnoses the deepest divisions in our society and provides an urgent manifesto for collective healing.' David Lammy MP This landmark book tackles a deceptively simple idea: the more we spend time with people unlike ourselves, doing things together, the more understanding, tolerant, and even friendly we become. Combining fresh analysis with a wealth of fascinating examples, Jon Yates demonstrates the ways in which our societies have become disconnected, so that most of us spend less and less time with people who are different \u2014 as defined by age, race, or class, earning power or education. By answering a series of surprising questions, Yates reveals a set of truths that will change the way you think about yourself and those around you. What unites the England football team, the iPod and Singapore? How did a city that funded its schools the least become the best place to grow up poor? How did Silicon Valley come from nowhere to dominate the tech industry? How did a village of Italian-Americans become incredibly healthy while smoking cigars, drinking red wine and never exercising? And why is talking to our friends about politics the worst thing we can do for our democracy? Fractured is ultimately an optimistic book, showing convincingly how great people are when they're united in diversity. It argues that the pandemic has created an unprecedented opportunity for us to come together. So we must forge a new 'Common Life' \u2013 a set of shared practises and institutions \u2014 that can strengthen the glue that bonds our societies, in all their diversity. For the health of our democracy, our society, and our economy, the time to act is now. "

                "Despite more power and choices than ever before, women are still angry \u2014 that's not necessarily a bad thing, as anger is what continues to open the door for change. In this collection, 15 women speak boldly and passionately about choices they've made \u2014 about sex, children, love and work \u2014 and explore what's working and what is not. Their essays \u2014 always provocative, honest, witty and wise \u2014 are the culmination of the lessons of the past two decades, the 'me' years and the therapy years, the years that have taught women to express themselves and acknowledge their needs. As celebratory as they are critical, these brilliant essays reflect the truth about life.  Audio contains the following essays, written and read by the contributors:  Introduction \u2014 Cathi Hanauer  Getting the Milk for Free \u2014 Veronica Chambers  Crossing to Safety \u2014 Jen Marshall  Moving In.

Dan Abrams tackles the toughest case of his career in Man Down. Drawing on years of legal experience and research studies, Abrams explains step-by-step why women are better than men in just about every way imaginable, from managing money to flying planes to living longer. Abrams uses his trademark charm to get his point across without opining on the issue himself. Chock-full of fun facts and conversation starters, this book may not end the debate of men versus women, but it will definitely make it more interesting. "

                "An invaluable guide to understanding and dismantling sexism for parents trying to raise confident and powerful girls in a culture that often demeans them.    \u201cSeasoned and sensible guidance on the toughest topics in raising girls: misogyny, objectification, body image, confidence, harassment, sexual development, and more.\u201d\u2014Lisa Damour, PhD,  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Emotional Lives of Teenagers   The world is full of mixed messages for girls: Stand up for yourself but do it softly. Be independent but not single. Love your body, just make sure it\u2019s waxed, bleached, and thin. And then there are the more overt hostilities: being talked over, paid less, touched without permission, and having politicians debate their right to bodily autonomy. Many parents find it simpler to affirm girls\u2019 strength than to address these distressing experiences directly. But with girls\u2019 skyrocketing rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide, parenting them in this culture presents an urgent challenge: How do we teach girls to recognize and cope with these realities without crushing their optimism and belief that they can incite change? Jo-Ann Finkelstein, a Harvard-educated psychologist, has more than two decades of experience working with girls, helping them find resilience in the face of toxic messages about beauty, sex, and femininity. In  Sexism & Sensibility,  she draws on real stories from her practice to unpack the effects of sexism in its many guises.\u00a0Going beyond girl power and full of smart, constructive ways to help girls make sense of things,\u00a0it includes\u00a0 \u2022 how to talk about misogyny, gender stereotyping, objectification, and consent\u2014at different ages \u2022 strategies for fine-tuning our daughters\u2019 natural \u201csexism detectors\u201d and safeguarding their self-esteem\u00a0 \u2022 ways to help girls spot and contest the microaggressions they face in school, in the media, in relationships, and in public \u2022 how to recognize and combat sexism in our own parenting We can\u2019t shield our daughters from gender bias and sexism, but we  can  make sure that they are more prepared to handle it than we ever were.  Sexism & Sensibility  is an eye-opening and essential resource for proactive parenting. "

                "A searing critique of the disability rights movement from within, and a call for collective liberation that is pro-Black and centers disabled people of color  For over twenty years, Dara Baldwin has often been the only person of color in the room when significant disability policy decisions are made. Disenfranchisement of people of color and multi-marginalized communities within the disability rights community is not new and has left many inside the community feeling frustrated and erased. In  To Be a Problem , Baldwin candidly shares her journey to becoming a disability activist and policymaker in DC while critiquing the disability rights community. She reveals the reality of erasure for many Black people and people of color in the disability movement and argues that, in turn, many white disabled people center themselves within the work without addressing their own white privilege. Disability rights groups have been centering white, straight, cisgender people while racial justice groups often fail to center disabled people, leading many Black and Brown disabled people to start their own Disability Justice organizations. Drawing from her unique vantage point, Baldwin calls readers to understand the shortcomings of the disability rights movement while inspiring us to push all movements towards a more inclusive and authentic liberation.

                "Few women artists feature prominently in the history of art, and even fewer who are mothers. What can we learn about ambition, limitation, and creativity from women who persist in doing both? Forged in the stress of early motherhood,  The Mother Artist  explores the fraught yet generative ties between caregiving and creative practice. As a young mother working at a museum, essayist Catherine Ricketts began asking questions about the making of motherhood and the making of art. Now, with incantatory prose and an intuitive gaze, she twines intimate meditations on parenthood with studies of the work and lives of painters, writers, dancers, musicians, and other creatives. Ricketts takes listeners through the studios of mother artists, placing us in the company of women from the past and the present who persevere in both art and caregiving. We encounter Senga Nengudi's sculptures, which celebrate the pregnant body, and Toni Morrison's powerful writing on childbirth. We behold Joan Didion's meditations on maternal grief and Alice Neel's portraits of mothers and babies. And we observe the ambition of sculptor Ruth Asawa, the activism of printmaker Elizabeth Catlett, and the constancy of writer Madeleine L'Engle. This book is for mothers who aspire to make art, anyone eager to discover the stories of visionary women, and all who long for a revolution of tenderness. "

By Sunday, women have taken to the streets across Iran, setting their headscarves on fire and cursing the Supreme Leader. Months later, workers down their tools and businesses close.

From an International Women's Day celebrated inside Iran's most notorious prison to mass strikes in Kurdistan, ordinary Iranians are taking risks to fight for a better future.  Even as the regime spills blood in retaliation, Iranians have not given up. Today one thing's clear: no Supreme Leader can turn the clock back.

                "\"From foot-binding to corsets, patriarchal societies have found ways to immobilize women, but now, marathoners and Olympians are proving that women can run like the wind!\" \u2014GLORIA STEINEM  \"A look behind the curtain that all women who love running and sport should read.\"  \u2014 KARA GOUCHER, Olympic runner and  New York Times -bestselling author of  The Longest Race     More than a century ago, a woman ran in the very first modern Olympic marathon. She just did it without permission.  Award-winning journalist Maggie Mertens uncovers the story of how women broke into competitive running and how they are getting faster and fiercer every day\u2014and changing our understanding of what is possible as they go.   Despite women proving their abilities on the track time and again, men in the medical establishment, media, and athletic associations have fought to keep women (or at least white women) fragile\u2014and sometimes literally tried to push them out of the race (see Kathrine Switzer, Boston Marathon, 1967). Yet before there were running shoes for women, they ran barefoot or in nursing shoes. They ran without sports bras, which weren't invented until 1977, or disguised as men. They faced down doctors who put them on bed rest and newspaper reports that said women collapsed if they ran a mere eight hundred meters, just two laps around the track. Still today, women face relentless attention to their bodies: Is she too strong, too masculine? Is she even really a woman?  Mertens transports us from that first boundary-breaking marathon in Greece, 1896, to the earliest \"official\" women's races of the twentieth century to today's most intense ultramarathons, in which women are setting all-out records, even against men. For readers of  Good and Mad ,  Born to Run , and  Fly Girls ,  Better Faster Farther  takes us inside the lives and the victories of the women who have redefined society's image of strength and power.  \"An essential read to normalize women's existence, excellence, and humanity within the sport of running.\"  \u2014 ALISON MARIELLA D\u00c9SIR.

A modern argument, grounded in philosophy and cultural criticism, about childbearing ambivalence and how to overcome it     Becoming a parent, once the expected outcome of adulthood, is increasingly viewed as a potential threat to the most basic goals and aspirations of modern life. We seek self-fulfillment; we want to liberate women to find meaning and self-worth outside the home; and we wish to protect the planet from the ravages of climate change. Weighing the pros and cons of having children, millennials and zoomers are finding it increasingly difficult to judge in its favor.  With lucid argument and passionate prose, Anastasia Berg and Rachel Wiseman offer the guidance necessary to move beyond uncertainty. The decision whether or not to have children, they argue, is not just a women's issue but a basic human one. And at a time when climate change worries threaten the very legitimacy of human reproduction, Berg and Wiseman conclude that neither our personal nor collective failures ought to prevent us from embracing the fundamental goodness of human life\u2014not only in the present but, in choosing to have children, in the future.

An inclusive and essential new resource for reproductive health\u2014including period problems, pelvic pain, menopause, fertility, sexual health, vaginal and urinary conditions, and overall wellbeing\u2014from leading expert and fierce advocate Dr. Karen Tang  Did you know that up to 90% of women experience menstrual abnormalities or pelvic issues in their lifetime? Yet these conditions are overwhelmingly misunderstood, misdiagnosed, or dismissed. The root causes for these issues, such as PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, PMDD, or pelvic floor dysfunction, don't receive the stream of funding for research and new treatments that other conditions do, despite affecting up to half the population. Dr. Karen Tang is on a mission to transform how we engage with our bodies and our healthcare.  It's Not Hysteria  is a comprehensive guide to common conditions and potential treatment options, with practical tools such as symptom prompts and sample questions for your provider, to equip readers to take control of their gynecologic health. Reproductive healthcare, from abortion to gender-affirming care, is under siege. The onus continues to fall on patients to find and advocate for the care they need. In the face of uncertainty and misinformation,  It's Not Hysteria  is destined to become a new classic that educates and empowers women and those assigned female at birth.

But few today realize that she was the last in a long line of Egyptian queens who bore that name.\u202f\u202f   \u202f\u202f   In  The Cleopatras , historian Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones tells the dramatic story of these seven incomparable women, vividly recapturing the lost world of Hellenistic Egypt and tracing the kingdom's final centuries before its fall to Rome. The Cleopatras were Greek-speaking descendants of Ptolemy, the general who conquered Egypt alongside Alexander the Great. They were closely related as mothers, daughters, sisters, half-sisters, and nieces. Each wielded absolute power, easily overshadowing their husbands or sons, and all proved to be shrewd and capable leaders. Styling themselves as goddess-queens, the Cleopatras ruled through the canny deployment of arcane rituals, opulent spectacles, and unparalleled wealth. They navigated political turmoil and court intrigues, led armies into battle and commanded fleets of ships, and ruthlessly dispatched their dynastic rivals.\u202f\u202f\u202f   \u202f\u202f   The Cleopatras  is a fascinating and richly textured biography of seven extraordinary women, restoring these queens to their deserved place among history's greatest rulers.

                "Part memoir, part searing revelation, Seen Yet Unseen takes readers behind the scenes of some of the world's biggest tech companies and exposes the way their exclusion of and, at times, hostility toward Black women have lasting impacts on the technology we use every day.  Over the years the products of big tech companies and Silicon Valley have become indispensable to our lives. They impact the way we socialize, make purchases, and even our medical decisions. But what happens when a major segment of the population\u2014in this case Black women\u2014isn't included in these companies?  For over a decade, B\u00e4r\u00ed A. Williams has worked to carve a space for herself as a Black woman in the incredibly white male sphere of major tech companies, eventually becoming a lead counsel at Facebook and architect of their supplier diversity program. However, she also experienced the peculiar feeling familiar to Black women in the workforce: being both unseen and too seen. In raw and personal stories, Williams recounts balancing on glass cliffs while battling the burnout that so often forces Black women out of these companies, and how the industry's lack\u2014and loss\u2014of Black women not only harms the businesses themselves but has troubling ramifications for their products, particularly as the promises of AI and the Metaverse loom large.  In a tone both forthright and revealing, Williams dissects how a culture that has largely excluded Black women\u2014and people of color more generally\u2014is at a tipping point and that only through embracing and listening to Black women can we prevent the further weaponization of these technologies against marginalized communities. From fledgling in-house diversity initiatives to gentrification and the rise of AI, Seen Yet Unseen takes the reader inside the obscured machinations of big tech companies and makes a case for why diversity is essential to the future of technology.

When her beloved cousin was murdered just as both girls were entering adulthood, Dancyger\u2019s devotion to the women in her life took on a new urgency\u2014a desire to hold her friends close while she still could. In  First Love , this urgency runs through a striking exploration of the bonds between women, from the intensity of adolescent best friendship and fluid sexuality to mothering and chosen family. Each essay in this incisive collection   is grounded in a close female friendship in Dancyger\u2019s life, reaching outward to dissect cultural assumptions about identity and desire, and the many ways women create space for each other in a world that wants us small. Seamlessly weaving personal experience with literature and pop culture\u2014ranging from fairy tales to true crime, from Ana\u00efs Nin and Sylvia Plath to  Heavenly Creatures  and the \u201csad girls\u201d of Tumblr\u2014Dancyger\u2019s essays form a kaleidoscopic story of a life told through friendships, and an expansive interrogation of what it means to love each other. Though friendship will never be enough to keep us safe from the dangers of the world, Dancyger reminds us that love is always worth the risk, and that when tragedy strikes, it\u2019s our friends who will help us survive. In  First Love,  these essential bonds get their due. "

                "A  NEW YORK TIMES ,  LOS ANGELES TIMES ,  USA TODAY  BESTSELLER     The life and legacy of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, wife of John F. Kennedy Jr., are reexamined in this captivating and effervescent biography that is perfect for fans of  My Travels with Mrs. Kennedy ,  What Remains , and  Fairy Tale Interrupted .  A quarter of a century after the plane crash that claimed the lives of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn, and her sister Lauren, the magnitude of this tragedy remains fresh. Yet, Carolyn is still an enigmatic figure, a woman whose short life in the spotlight was besieged with misogyny and cruelty.    Amidst today's cultural reckoning about the way our media treats women, Elizabeth Beller explores the real person behind the tabloid headlines and media frenzy. When she began dating America's prince, Carolyn was increasingly thrust into an overwhelming spotlight filled with relentless paparazzi who reacted to her reserve with a campaign of harassment and vilification.    To this day, she is still depicted as a privileged princess\u2014icy, vapid, and drug-addicted. She has even been accused of being responsible for their untimely death, allegedly delaying take-off until she finished her pedicure. But now, she is revealed as never before.    A fiercely independent woman devoted to her adopted city and career, Carolyn relied on her impeccable eye and drive to fly up the ranks at Calvin Klein in the glossy, high-stakes fashion world of the 1990s. When Carolyn met her future husband, John was immediately drawn to her strong-willed personality, effortless charm, and high intelligence. Their relationship would change her life and catapult her to dizzying fame, but it was her vibrant life before their marriage and then hidden afterwards, that is truly fascinating.    Based on in-depth research and exclusive interviews with friends, family members, teachers, roommates, and colleagues, and featuring never-before-seen family photos, this comprehensive biography reveals a multi-faceted woman worthy of our attention regardless of her husband and untimely death.

                "A stirring, comprehensive look at the state of women in the workforce\u2014why women's progress has stalled, how our economy fosters unproductive competition, and how we can fix the system that holds women back.   In an era of supposed great equality, women are still falling behind in the workplace. Even with more women in the workforce than in decades past, wage gaps continue to increase. It is the most educated women who have fallen the furthest behind. Blue-collar women hold the most insecure and badly paid jobs in our economy. And even as we celebrate high-profile representation\u2014women on the board of Fortune 500 companies and our first female vice president\u2014women have limited recourse when they experience harassment and discrimination.     Fair Shake: Women and the Fight to Build a Just Economy  explains that the system that governs our economy\u2014a winner-take-all economy\u2014is the root cause of these myriad problems. The WTA economy self-selects for aggressive, cutthroat business tactics, which creates a feedback loop that sidelines women. The authors, three legal scholars, call this feedback loop \"the triple bind\": if women  don't  compete on the same terms as men, they lose; if women  do  compete on the same terms as men, they're punished more harshly for their sharp elbows or actual misdeeds; and when women see that they can't win on the same terms as men, they take themselves out of the game (if they haven't been pushed out already). With odds like these stacked against them, it's no wonder women feel like, no matter how hard they work, they can't get ahead.    Fair Shake  is not a \"fix the woman\" book; it's a \"fix the system\" book. It not only diagnoses the problem of what's wrong with the modern economy, but shows how, with awareness and collective action, we can build a truly just economy for all. "

                "Barbie is a strong, independent doll. But is she a feminist icon? It's complicated. Since her introduction in 1959, Barbie's impact has been revolutionary. Far from being a toy designed by men to oppress women, she was a toy invented by women to teach women what was expected of them, for better or for worse. Whether tarred-and-glittered as antifeminist puffery or celebrated as a feminist icon (or, at any rate, an important cultural touchstone in understanding feminism), Barbie has undeniably influenced generations of girls. In Forever Barbie, cultural critic, investigative journalist, and first-generation Barbie owner M. G. Lord uncovers the surprising story behind Barbie's smash success. Revealing her low origins as \"Bild Lilli,\" a risqu\u00e9 doll for adults sold as a gag gift in postwar Germany, Forever Barbie traces Barbie's development and transformation, through countless makeovers and career changes, into an international pop culture icon and now \"traditional toy.\" Though not every doll in the line has been a hit\u2014with pregnant Midge and Growing up Skipper among the more intriguing disasters\u2014Barbie's endurance, Lord writes, speaks as much to Mattel's successful marketing as it does to our society's overall ambivalence toward femininity. With new accessories, including a preface on the latest developments in the Barbieverse, Forever Barbie \"will make you think of America's most celebrated plastic doll in ways you never have before\" (Susan Faludi).

The caravan left Vancouver with 17 activists and arrived in Ottawa on May 8th 1970, where over 500 women rallied and shut down parliament.   In the spring of 1970, seventeen women set out from Vancouver in a big yellow convertible, a Volkswagen bus, and a pickup truck. They called it the Abortion Caravan. Three thousand miles later, they \"occupied\" the prime minister's front lawn in Ottawa, led a rally of 500 women on Parliament Hill, chained themselves to their chairs in the visitors' galleries, and shut down the House of Commons, the first and only time this had ever happened. The seventeen were a motley crew. They argued, they were loud, and they wouldn't take no for an answer. They pulled off a national campaign in an era when there was no social media, and with a budget that didn't stretch to long-distance phone calls. It changed their lives. And at a time when thousands of women in Canada were dying from back street abortions, it pulled women together across the country. "

From the outside, Rumana seemed an unlikely victim of domestic abuse: married to a man of her own choosing and progressing in her career as a professor of international relations at Dhaka University. But in 2011, on return from graduate studies at the University of British Columbia, her husband attacked and blinded her in front of their young daughter. As Rumana's horrifying story garnered international headlines, and connections brought her to Vancouver in an attempt\u2014ultimately futile\u2014to restore her sight, her plight underscored the fact that there are no typical victims of intimate-partner violence. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Denise Chong goes behind the headlines to reveal the devolution of a love story into a tale of tyranny behind closed doors, and the pursuit of justice that proved all the more elusive during the rise of social media.  Out of Darkness  tells a globe-spanning narrative of loyalty, perseverance and a woman\u2019s determination to face the future and rebuild a life with meaning. "

Wade, the renewed debate over women's reproductive rights places an even greater emphasis on adoption. Wellington's timely-and deeply researched-account amplifies previously marginalized voices and exposes the social and racial biases embedded in the United States' adoption industry. The history of adoption is rarely told from an adoptee's perspective. Wellington remedies this gap by framing the chronicle of adoption in America using her own life story. As she reckons with the pain and unanswered questions of her own experience, she explores broader issues surrounding adoption in the United States, including changing legal policies, sterilization and compulsory relinquishment programs, forced assimilation of babies of color and Indigenous babies adopted into white families, and other liabilities. According to Wellington, US adoption practices in America are shrouded in secrecy, for they frequently cast shame on unmarried women, women struggling with fertility, and \"illegitimate\" babies and children. As the United States once again finds itself embroiled in heated disputes over women's bodily autonomy Wellington's book offers a unique and much-needed frame of reference. "

Throughout American history, women have helped propel what we know as classic cocktails-the Martini, the Manhattan, the Old-Fashioned, and more-into popular culture. But, often excluded from private clubs, women exercised this influence from the home, in their cocktail parlors. In The Cocktail Parlor, Dr. Nicola Nice, sociologist and spirits entrepreneur, gives women their long-overdue spotlight in cocktail history and shows how they still impact cocktail culture today. Journeying through the decades, this book profiles a diverse array of influential hostesses. With each historic era comes iconic recipes, featuring a total of forty main cocktails and more than 100 variations that listeners can make at home. Whether its happy hour punch a la Martha Washington or a Harlem Renaissance-inspired Green Skirt, listeners will find that many of the ingredients and drinks they're familiar with today wouldn't be here without the hostesses who served them first.

                "In the modern information age, our brain's coping mechanisms have been overloaded, and our irrationality turned up to eleven. Amanda Montell blends cultural criticism and personal narrative to explore our modern cognitive biases and the power, disadvantages and highlights of magical overthinking. \"Magical thinking\" can be broadly defined as the belief that one's internal thoughts can affect unrelated events in the external world. Whether that's \"manifesting\" their way out of poverty, staving off cancer with positive vibes, or transforming an unhealthy relationship to a glorious one through loyalty alone. In a series of razor sharp and introspective chapters, Montell delves into cognitive biases that run rampant in our brains, from how the \"halo effect\" cultivates worship (and hatred) of larger-than-life celebrities, to how the \"sunk cost fallacy\" can keep us in detrimental relationships long after they no longer serve us. Told with her signature brilliance and wit, Montell's prevailing message is one of hope and forgiveness for our anxiety riddled human self. If you have all but lost faith in our ability to reason through the noise of information overload, this book aims to make sense of the senseless. To crack open a window in our minds and let the fresh air in. To help quiet the cacophony for a while, and maybe, even hear a melody in it. "

One of  Entertainment Weekly 's \"Books We Are Excited to Read in 2024\" \u00a0   Before Constance Wu, Sandra Oh, Awkwafina, or Lucy Liu, there was Anna May Wong. In her time, she was a legendary beauty, witty conversationalist, and fashion icon. Plucked from her family\u2019s laundry business in Los Angeles, Anna May Wong rose to stardom in Douglas Fairbanks\u2019s blockbuster  The Thief of Bagdad . Fans and the press clamored to see more of this unlikely actress, but when Hollywood repeatedly cast her in stereotypical roles, she headed abroad in protest.   \u00a0  Anna May starred in acclaimed films in Berlin, Paris, and London. She dazzled royalty and heads of state across several nations, leaving trails of suitors in her wake. She returned to challenge Hollywood at its own game by speaking out about the industry\u2019s blatant racism. She used her new stature to move away from her typecasting as the China doll or dragon lady, and worked to reshape Asian American representation in film.  \u00a0  Filled with stories of capricious directors and admiring costars, glamorous parties and far-flung love affairs,  Not Your China Doll  showcases the vibrant, radical life of a groundbreaking artist.

In On Disinformation, Lee McIntyre shows how the war on facts began, and how ordinary citizens can fight back against the scourge of disinformation that is now threatening the very fabric of our society. Drawing on his twenty years of experience as a scholar of science denial, McIntyre explains how autocrats wield disinformation to manipulate a populace and deny obvious realities, why the best way to combat disinformation is to disrupt its spread, and most importantly, how we can win the war on truth. McIntyre goes through the history of strategic denialism to show how we arrived at this precarious political moment and identifies the creators, amplifiers, and believers of disinformation. On Disinformation lays out ten everyday practical steps that we can take as ordinary citizens-from resisting polarization to pressuring our Congresspeople to regulate social media-as well as the important steps our government (if we elect the right leaders) must take. On Disinformation empowers us to save our republic from autocracy before it is too late. "

The compelling true story behind the testimony that awed the nation   On September 27, 2018, Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee which was considering the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. She described an alleged sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee that took place at a high school party in the 1980s. Her words and courage on that day provided some of the most credible and unforgettable testimony our country has ever witnessed.  In  One Way Back , Ford recounts the months she spent trying to get information into the right hands without exposing herself and her family to dangerous backlash. Drawing parallels to her life as a surfer, she explains the process of paddling out into unknown waters despite the risks and fears, knowing there is only one way back to shore. The book reveals riveting new details about the leadup to her testimony and its overwhelming aftermath and describes how she continues to navigate her way out of the storm. This is the real story behind the headlines and the soundbites, a complex, page-turning memoir of a scientist, a surfer, a mother, a patriot and an unlikely whistleblower. Ford's experience shows that when one person steps forward to speak truth to power, she adds to a collective whole, causing \"a ripple that might one day become a wave.\"  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press.

In  Over the Influence , communication professor and CNN Opinion contributor Kara Alaimo reveals how social media is affecting every aspect of the lives of women and girls\u2014from our relationships and our parenting to our physical and mental well-being.  Over the Influence  is an audiobook about what it means to live in the world social media has wrought\u2014whether you\u2019re constantly connected or have deleted your accounts forever. Alaimo shows why you\u2019re likely to get fewer followers if you\u2019re a woman. She explains how fake news is crafted to prey on women\u2019s vulnerabilities. She reveals why so much of the content we find in our feeds is specifically designed to hold us back. And she explains how social media has made the offline world an uglier place for women. But we can change this. Alaimo offers up brilliant advice for how to get over the influence\u2014how to handle our daughters\u2019 use of social media, use dating apps to find the partners we\u2019re looking for, use social networks to bolster our careers, and protect ourselves from sextortionists, catfishers, and trolls. She also explains what we need to demand from lawmakers and tech companies.  Over the Influence  calls on women to recognize and call out the subtle (and not-so-subtle) sexism and misogyny we find online, reject misinformation that is targeted to us because of our gender, and use our platforms to empower ourselves and other women.

Observer From one of our leading experts on disinformation, the incredible true story of the complex and largely forgotten WWII propagandist Sefton Delmer - and what we can learn from him today. In the summer of 1941, Hitler ruled Europe from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. Britain was struggling to combat the powerful Nazi propaganda machine, which crowed victory and smeared its enemies. But inside Germany, there was one notable voice of dissent from the very heart of the military machine, Der Chef, a German whose radio broadcasts skilfully questioned Nazi doctrine. He had access to high-ranking German military secrets and spoke of internal rebellion. His listeners included German soldiers and citizens. American officials and even the President tried to to decipher what it meant for the future of the war. But what these audiences didn't know was that Der Chef was a fiction, a character created by the British propagandist Sefton Delmer, just one player in Delmer's vast counter-propaganda cabaret, a unique weapon in the war. As author Peter Pomerantsev uncovers Delmer's story, he is called into a wartime propaganda effort of his own: the global response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This book is the story of Delmer and his modern-day investigator, as they each embark on their own quest to seduce and inspire the passions of supporters and enemies, and to turn the tide of information wars.

                "This remarkable work about women writers in the English Renaissance explodes our notion of the Shakespearean period by drawing us into the lives of four women who were committed to their craft long before anyone ever imagined the possibility of \u201ca room of one\u2019s own.\u201d  In an innovative and engaging narrative of everyday life in Shakespeare\u2019s England, Ramie Targoff carries us from the sumptuous coronation of Queen Elizabeth in the mid-sixteenth century into the private lives of four women writers working at a time when women were legally the property of men. Some readers may have heard of Mary Sidney, accomplished poet and sister of the famous Sir Philip Sidney, but few will have heard of Aemilia Lanyer, the first woman in the seventeenth century to publish a book of original poetry, which offered a feminist take on the crucifixion, or Elizabeth Cary, who published the first original play by a woman, about the plight of the Jewish princess Mariam. Then there was Anne Clifford, a lifelong diarist who fought for decades against a patriarchy that tried to rob her of her land in one of England\u2019s most infamous inheritance battles. These women had husbands and children to care for and little support for their art, yet against all odds they defined themselves as writers, finding rooms of their own where doors had been shut for centuries. Targoff flings those doors open, revealing the treasures left by these extraordinary women; in the process, she helps us see the Renaissance in a fresh light, creating a richer understanding of history and offering a much-needed female perspective on life in Shakespeare\u2019s day.

                "From the closing years of the nineteenth century, women received subtle-and not so subtle-messages that they shouldn't be in public. Or, if they were, that they were not safe. Breaking the Gender Code tells the story of both this danger narrative and the resistance to it. Historian Georgina Hickey investigates challenges to the code of urban gender segregation in the twentieth century, focusing on organized advocacy to make the public spaces of American cities accessible to women. She traces waves of activism from the Progressive Era, with its calls for public restrooms, safe and accessible transportation, and public accommodations, through and beyond second-wave feminism, and its focus on the creation of alternative, women-only spaces and extensive anti-violence efforts. In doing so, Hickey explores how gender segregation intertwined with other systems of social control, as well as how class, race, and sexuality shaped activists' agendas and women's experiences of urban space. Drawing connections between the vulnerability of women in public spaces, real and presumed, and contemporary debates surrounding rape culture, bathroom bills, and domestic violence, Hickey unveils both the strikingly successful and the incomplete initiatives of activists who worked to open up public space to women.

                "From the  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Recovering  and  The Empathy Exams  comes the riveting story of rebuilding a life after the end of a marriage\u2014an exploration of motherhood, art, and new love.      Leslie Jamison has become one of our most beloved contemporary voices, a scribe of the real, the true, the complex. She has been compared to Joan Didion and Susan Sontag, acclaimed for her powerful thinking, deep feeling, and electric prose. But while Jamison has never shied away from challenging material\u2014scouring her own psyche and digging into our most unanswerable questions across four books\u2014 Splinters  enters a new realm.    In her first memoir, Jamison turns her unrivaled powers of perception on some of the most intimate relationships of her life: her consuming love for her young daughter, a ruptured marriage once swollen with hope, and the shaping legacy of her own parents' complicated bond. In examining what it means for a woman to be many things at once\u2014a mother, an artist, a teacher, a lover\u2014Jamison places the magical and the mundane side by side in surprising ways: pumping breastmilk in a shared university office, driving the open highway in the throes of new love, growing a tender second skin of consciousness as she watches her daughter come alive to the world. The result is a work of nonfiction like no other, an almost impossibly deep reckoning with the muchness of life and art, and a book that grieves the departure of one love even as it celebrates the arrival of another.    How do we move forward into joy when we are haunted by loss? How do we claim hope alongside the harm we've caused? A memoir for which the very term  tour de force  seems to have been coined,  Splinters  plumbs these and other pressing questions with writing that is revelatory to the last page. Jamison has delivered a book with the linguistic daring and emotional acuity that made  The Empathy Exams  and  The Recovering  instant classics, even as she reaches new depths of understanding, piercing the reader to the core. A master of nonfiction, she evinces once again her ability to \"stitch together the intellectual and the emotional with the finesse of a crackerjack surgeon\" (NPR). "

                "When Valena Beety first became a federal prosecutor, her goal was to protect victims, especially women, from cycles of violence. What she discovered was that not only did prosecutions often fail to help victims, they frequently relied on false information, forensic fraud, and police and prosecutor misconduct. Seeking change, Beety began working in the Innocence Movement, helping to free factually innocent people through DNA testing and criminal justice reform. Manifesting Justice focuses on the shocking story of Beety's client Leigh Stubbs-a young, queer woman in Mississippi, convicted of a horrific crime she did not commit because of her sexual orientation. Beety weaves Stubbs's harrowing narrative through the broader story of a broken criminal justice system. Drawing on interviews with both innocence advocates and wrongfully convicted women, along with Beety's own experiences as an expert litigator and a queer woman, Manifesting Justice provides a unique outsider/insider perspective. Beety expands our notion of justice to include not just people who are factually innocent, but those who are over-charged, pressured into bad plea deals, and over-sentenced. The result is a riveting and timely book that will transform our very ideas of crime and punishment, what innocence is, and who should be free. "

Wendy Moore, author of Endell Street: The Women Who Ran Britain's Trailblazing Military Hospital The second world war could not have been won without the bravery and selflessness of women on the Home Front. Women like Kathleen Johnstone. This first-hand story of one extraordinary but unheralded member of Britain's 'Greatest Generation' brings home with extraordinary lucidity and compassion the realities of wartime Lancashire. In 1943, Kathleen, then thirty, was a nurse-in-training at the Blackburn Royal Infirmary. For the next three years she kept a meticulous diary of her day-to-day existence, leaving behind a vivid record of the real-time concerns of a busy, thoughtful woman on the frontline of the war at home. Kathleen's days were never the same. She writes in clear and lively prose about life in the hospital: of her fellow nurses, her patients, about death and dying, and the progress of the war as wounded soldiers returned from Normandy in the summer of 1944. She muses on being working class, wartime austerity, and her anxiety about examinations. Here too are dances, Americans and a POW boyfriend in Germany. Kathleen's observations are witty, wry and astute \u2013 but above all relatable, even today. Poignant and engrossing, Kathleen Johnstone's tale of trauma, romance and friendship will leave a lasting impression. "

Philippa Gregory has produced something rare and wonderful: a genuinely new history of [Britain], with women at its beating heart.\" \u2014Dan Jones, New York Times bestselling author of The Plantagenets    \"Stunning. . . . Full of surprises. . . . A brilliant, essential read.\" \u2014The Independent (UK)     The #1 New York Times bestselling historical novelist delivers her magnum opus\u2014a landmark work of feminist nonfiction that radically redefines our understanding of the extraordinary roles ordinary women played throughout British history and \"should be included in every history lesson\" (Glamour UK)   Did you know that there are more penises than women in the Bayeux Tapestry? That the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was started and propelled by women who were protesting a tax on women? Or that celebrated naturalist Charles Darwin believed not just that women were naturally inferior to men, but that they'd evolve to become ever more inferior?  These are just a few of the startling findings you will learn from reading Philippa Gregory's Normal Women. In this ambitious and groundbreaking book, she tells the story of England over 900 years, for the very first time placing women\u2014some fifty per cent of the population\u2014center stage.  Using research skills honed in her work as one of our foremost historical novelists, Gregory trawled through court records, newspapers, and journals to find highwaywomen and beggars, murderers and brides, housewives and pirates, female husbands and hermits. The \"normal women\" you will meet in these pages went to war, ploughed the fields, campaigned, wrote, and loved. They rode in jousts, flew Spitfires, issued their own currency, and built ships, corn mills and houses. They committed crimes or treason, worshipped many gods, cooked and nursed, invented things, and rioted. A lot.  A landmark work of scholarship and storytelling, Normal Women chronicles centuries of social and cultural change\u2014from 1066 to modern times\u2014powered by the determination, persistence, and effectiveness of women.

                "A scathing reexamination of the lives of nine female celebrities in the 2000s, and the sexist, exploitative culture that took them down   Welcome to celebrity culture in the early aughts: the reign of Perez Hilton, celebrity sex tapes, and dueling tabloids fed by paparazzi who were willing to do anything to get the shot. It was a time when the Internet was still the Wild West, and when slut-shaming, fat-shaming, and revenge porn were all considered perfectly legitimate. Celebrity was seen as a commodity to be consumed, and for the famous women of this era, they were never as popular\u2014or as vulnerable\u2014as when they were in crisis.   Toxic  tells the stories of nine women who defined the hell of celebrity in the 2000s and explores how they were devoured by fame, how they attempted to control their own narratives, and how they succeeded or (more often) failed. These women come from all walks of fame\u2014pop music, acting, reality TV, and WWE wrestling. Some of them you think you know already, and others will be less familiar, but  Toxic  reveals these women neither as pure victims nor as conniving strategists, but as complex individuals trying to navigate celebrity while under attack from a vicious and fast-changing media. Their portrayal has shaped the way that all women\u2014famous or otherwise\u2014are viewed today, and their experiences preempted the now-universal condition, especially thanks to social media, of living under the public gaze.  In this audiobook, Ditum brings readers back to a time before second chances and redemption arcs, and traces the ripple effects that came in the wake of spending a decade vilifying our idols. We\u2019ll see how these women\u2019s stories intersect with the birth of YouTube, the rise of Internet pornography, and the emergence of Donald Trump as a political force. It\u2019s time to come to terms with how those cultural events shaped the way we see ourselves, our bodies, our relationships, our aspirations, and our presence in the wider world. We are all products of the toxic decade. "

FIRST THINGS FIRST, hip-hop is not just the music, and women have played a big role in shaping the way it looks today. FIRST THINGS FIRST takes readers on a journey through some notable firsts by women in hip-hop history and their importance. Factual firsts like  Queen Latifah  becoming the first rapper to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,  Lauryn Hill  making history as the first rapper to win the coveted Album of the Year Award at the GRAMMYs,  April Walker  being the first woman to dominate in the hip-hop fashion game, and  Da Brat  being the first solo woman rapper to have an album go platinum, and metaphorical firsts like  Missy Elliott  being the first woman rapper to go to the future. (Trust me, she really did.)  There are chapters on music legends like  Nicki Minaj, Lil' Kim  and  Mary J. Blige , tv and radio hosts like  Big Lez  and  Angie Martinez , and so many more ladies I would name but I don't want to spoil the book! There are games, charts and some fire images, too.  Altogether, FIRST THINGS FIRST is a celebration of the achievements of women in hip-hop who broke down barriers and broke the mold. So the next time someone doesn't have their facts straight on the ladies in hip-hop, you can hit them with \"first things first\"... "

                "A reclamation of essential history and a hopeful gesture toward a better political future, this is what listening to Black women looks like \u2014from a professor of political science and columnist for  Teen Vogue  .    \u201cJenn M. Jackson is a beautiful writer and excellent scholar. In this book, they pay tribute to generations of Black women organizers and set forward a bold and courageous blueprint for our collective liberation.\u201d\u2014Imani Perry, author of  South to America    This is my offering. My love letter to them, and to us.  Jenn M. Jackson, PhD, has been known to bring historical acuity to some of the most controversial topics in America today. Now, in their first book, Jackson applies their critical analysis to the questions that have long energized their work: Why has Black women\u2019s freedom fighting been so overlooked throughout history, and what has our society lost because of our refusal to engage with our forestrugglers\u2019 lessons? A love letter to those who have been minimized and forgotten, this collection repositions Black women\u2019s intellectual and political work at the center of today\u2019s liberation movements. Across eleven original essays that explore the legacy of Black women writers and leaders\u2014from Harriet Jacobs and Ida B. Wells to the Combahee River Collective and Audre Lorde\u2014Jackson sets the record straight about Black women\u2019s longtime movement organizing, theorizing, and coalition building in the name of racial, gender, and sexual justice in the United States and abroad. These essays show, in both critical and deeply personal terms, how Black women have been at the center of modern liberation movements despite the erasure and misrecognition of their efforts. Jackson illustrates how Black women have frequently done the work of liberation at great risk to their lives and livelihoods. For a new generation of movement organizers and co-strugglers,  Black Women Taught Us  serves as a reminder that Black women were the first ones to teach us how to fight racism, how to name that fight, and how to imagine a more just world for everyone.

                "Frieda \"Fritizie\" Mann had several identities during her brief life, and the mysterious circumstances of her death raise as many questions as they do answers. She was born in 1903 near the present border between Poland and Ukraine. She and her family were Jewish immigrants who traveled to San Diego to find security and prosperity. In the last year of her life, Mann became locally famous. She had reinvented herself as a flapper and \"Oriental\" dancer. She claimed to have friends in Hollywood and a movie contract. On the night of her murder, she said she was going to a party to meet her Hollywood friends; instead she traveled to an isolated roadside hotel where she met her death. An autopsy revealed that she was four and a half months pregnant. Historian Amy Absher guides the listener through the intricacies of this true crime story as it unfolded, from the initial flawed investigation to the sensationalized press coverage and the ultimate failure of the legal system to ensure justice on Mann's behalf. Like other \"new women\" of her era, Fritzie Mann adopted roles that promised liberation from the control of men. In the end, her life and early death suggest the opposite: she became the victim of a culture that consumed women even as it purported to celebrate them. Contains mature themes. "

                "From  Playboy  to Jay-Z, the racial origins of toxic masculinity and its impact on women, especially Black and \u201cinsufficiently white\u201d women  More men than ever are refusing loving partnerships and commitment, and instead seeking out \u201csituationships.\u201d When these men deign to articulate what they are looking for in a steady partner, they\u2019ll often rely on superficial norms of attractiveness rooted in whiteness and anti-Blackness. Connecting the past to the present, sociologist Sabrina Strings argues that following the Civil Rights movement and the integration of women during the Second Wave Feminist movement, men aimed to hold on to their power by withholding love and commitment, a basic tenet of white supremacy and male domination, that served to manipulate all women. From pornography to hip hop, women\u2014especially Black and \u201cinsufficiently white\u201d women\u2014were presented as gold diggers, props for masturbation, and side-pieces. Using historical research, personal stories, and critical analysis, Strings argues that the result is fuccboism, the latest incarnation of toxic masculinity. This work shows that men are not innately \u201ctoxic.\u201d Nor do they hate love, commitment, or sex. Instead, men across race have been working a new code to effectively deny loving partnerships to women who are not pliant, slim, and white as a new mode of male domination. "

Kate is a pop culture commentator and host of the popular millennial-focused podcast  Be There in Five . Part-funny, part-serious, Kate navigates the complicated nature of celebrating and criticizing the culture that shaped her as a woman, while arguing that great depths can come from surface-level interests. With her trademark style and vulnerability,  One In a Millennial  is sharp, hilarious, and heartwarming all at once. She tackles AOL Instant Messenger, purity culture, American Girl Dolls, going out tops, Spice Girl feminism, her feelings about millennial motherhood, and more. Kate's laugh-out-loud asides and keen observations will have you nodding your head and maybe even tearing up.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

In exploring their lives she rewrites early American history, challenging the established male-centered narrative. Dubcovsky reconstructs the lives of Native women-Timucua, Apalachee, Chacato, and Guale-to show how they made claims to protect their livelihoods, bodies, and families. Through the stories of the Native cacica who demanded her authority be recognized; the elite Spanish woman who turned her dowry and household into a source of independent power; the Floridiana who slapped a leading Native man in the town square; and the Black woman who ran a successful business at the heart of a Spanish town, Dubcovsky reveals the formidable women who claimed and used their power, shaping the history of the early South.
