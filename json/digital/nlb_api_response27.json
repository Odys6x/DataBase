                "In Modern Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater, W.B. Worthen examines how the dynamic interplay between dramatic text and stage production shapes the audience's experience in the modern theater. Dividing the \"rhetoric\" of theatrical performance into three modes--realistic, poetic, and political--Worthen traces the course of British and American drama from the 1880s through the 1980s, showing how textual conventions and performance practices direct the interpretive performance of the theater audience. The realistic theater translates the objectivity associated with science into a vehicle for treating social class. Worthen examines realism's onstage representation of social \"others\" for an invisible, privileged offstage audience; he discusses the problem drama of the turn of the century (Robins, Shaw, Galsworthy, Glaspell), the experiments of O'Neill, Rice, and the American Method, and the contemporary realism of Pinter, Shepard and Bond. Where realistic theater relies on the \"natural\" qualities of the stage scene, poetic theater uses the poet's word, the text, to control performance. The plays of Yeats, Auden, Eliot, and Beckett explore the kinds of authority--over actors and audiences--that poetic theater can achieve. Modern political theater, by contrast, openly places the audience at the center of its rhetorical designs, and the drama of the postwar period (Barnes, Brenton, Churchill, Fornes, Nichols, Osborne, Soyinka) is shown to develop a range of post-Brechtian practices that make the audience the subject of the play. Treating a wide variety of plays and drawing extensively on performance history, Modern Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater outlines the strategies that have produced both the modern drama onstage and the modern audience in the theater.

                "Victorian women were exhilarated by the authoritative voice and the professional opportunity that, uniquely, the theatre offered them. Victorian men, anxious to preserve their dominance in this as in every other sphere of life, sought to limit the theatre as being distinctively, irrevocably masculine. Actresses were represented as inhuman monstrosities, not women at all. Furthermore, the executive functions of theatre-manager and playwright were carefully defined as requiring supposedly masculine qualities of mind and personality. A woman playwright came to be seen as an impossibility, although their number actually increased towards the close of the nineteenth century. In this book, Kerry Powell chronicles the development of women's participation in the theatre as playwrights, actresses and managers and explores the making of the Victorian actress, gender and playwriting of the period, and the contributions these made to developments in the following century.

Valerie Wayne takes a transformative look at the play's critical and performance history by examining its attention to gender, calumny and sexuality together with nationhood, colonialism and British identities. The authoritative play text is amply annotated to clarify its language and allusions, and three appendices delineate the play's textual history, its rich use of music and its casting. Offering students and scholars alike a wealth of insight and new research, this edition maintains the rigorous standards of the Arden Shakespeare. "

Subsequent generations have struggled with its bold confrontation of violence but in the 20th and 21st centuries the play has chimed with audiences again, perhaps because of its simultaneously shocking and playful approach to violent revenge and bodily mutilation. Jonathan Bate's original Arden edition was first published in 1995 and has had a significant influence on how the play has been performed and studied in the past 20 years. This revised edition includes a new 10,000 word introductory essay in which Bate reassess his views on the play's co-authorship with George Peele in the light of contemporary textual scholarship and updates his lively account of the play's performance history, on the international stage and screen. With detailed on-page commentary notes this will continue to be the edition of choice for students, scholars and theatre-makers. "

                "In  All's Well That Ends Well , Helen, a lowly ward, risks her life to satisfy her boundless love for Bertram, a count and ward to the King of France. Following him to Paris, she concocts an endangering plan to win the King of France's favour and induce Bertram's hand in marriage.  In the comprehensive introduction to this new, fully-illustrated Arden edition, Suzanne Gossett takes a transformative look at the play's critical and performance history by offering fresh perspectives on the conundrum of genre, sexuality and moral dilemmas with masculinity and the structures of family. The authoritative play text is amply annotated to clarify its language and allusions, and two appendices debate the play's authorship and review its casting. Offering students and scholars alike a wealth of insight and new research, this edition maintains the rigorous standards of the Arden Shakespeare. "

Othello  is one of Shakespeare's great tragedies-written in the same five-year period as  Hamlet,   King   Lear , and  Macbeth.  The new introduction attends to the play's different meanings throughout history, while articulating the historical context in which  Othello  was created, paying particular attention to Shakespeare's source materials and the evidence about early modern constructions of racial and religious difference. It also explores the life of the play in different historical moments, demonstrating how meanings and performances develop, accrue, and metamorphose over time.  The volume provides a rich and current resource, making this best-selling play edition ideal for today's students at advanced school and undergraduate level. "

                "The heroic Greek dramas that have moved theatergoers and readers since the fifth century B.C.  Towering over the rest of Greek tragedy, the three plays that tell the story of the fated Theban royal family\u2014 Antigone, Oedipus the King\u00a0 and \u00a0Oedipus at Colonus\u2014 are among the most enduring and timeless dramas ever written. Robert Fagles's authoritative and acclaimed translation conveys all of Sophocles's lucidity and power: the cut and thrust of his dialogue, his ironic edge, the surge and majesty of his choruses and, above all, the agonies and triumphs of his characters.\u00a0This Penguin Classics edition features an introduction and notes by the renowned classicist Bernard Knox. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700\u00a0titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Medea is the terrible story of a woman's bloody revenge on her adulterous husband through the murder of her own children. "

The Blame by Charlotte Langley is a debut psychological suspense police thriller in which two detectives begin a love affair, only for one of them to become a prime suspect in a chilling murder. Detective Erin Crane is assigned to the investigation into sixteen-year-old Sophie Madson's murder along with her partner, detective Tom Radley. Over the years they've formed a close professional bond built on mutual trust and a shared contempt for the unscrupulous head of the anti-corruption team, Walker. This case will prove a bigger test of their relationship than either of them could ever have imagined. During the investigation, Tom discovers Erin's biggest secret: that she put a man in prison under false evidence. But to her surprise, far from driving them apart, the revelation brings them closer together, and Tom and Erin embark on a love affair \u2013 despite the risk to their careers and the case. Then Erin discovers dashcam footage from a van driver, showing Sophie Madson getting into Tom's car barely an hour before she died. Tom becomes the prime suspect in the murder case and everything Erin thought she could trust begins to crumble... "

Professor Farah Karim-Cooper has dedicated her career to the Bard, which is why she wants to take the playwright down from his pedestal to unveil a Shakespeare for the twenty-first century. If we persist in reading Shakespeare as representative of only one group, as the very pinnacle of the white Western canon, then he will truly be in peril.  Combining piercing analysis of race, gender and otherness in famous plays from\u00a0Antony and Cleopatra\u00a0to\u00a0The Tempest\u00a0with a radical reappraisal of Elizabethan London,\u00a0The Great White Bard\u00a0asks us neither to idealize nor bury Shakespeare but instead to look him in the eye and reckon with the discomforts of his plays, playhouses and society. In inviting new perspectives and interpretations, we may yet prolong and enrich his extraordinary legacy. "

                "Martin Steelman, a senior United States Senator, has always trodden the path toward power and the Presidency, with which he was obsessed.  Towards that end he has sacrificed friendship, his marriage, daughter and grandchildren, from whom he is estranged.  But now he has been given a terminal medical diagnosis: his cardiac condition is incurable and irreversible and soon he will die.  Resigned to this, faced with the end of ambition and the hollowness of the life that his ambition has left him, Steelman moves to reconcile with his divorced wife, his estranged daughter and through them establishes with his grandchildren the first real family relationship he has ever had.  Then, Steelman finds that an experimental medical treatment, one which can be administered only in the weightless environment provided by the Russian space station, may save his life.  He is approached by the State Department and the Russians and offered the treatment and therefore the very possible extension of his life.  Decades earlier, in his capacity as a powerful Senate committee chairman, Steelman had been instrumental in killing a similar orbital station for the USA, calling it an egregious waste of public funds.  Now Steelman comes to understand that if he accepts the treatment he will be known as a hypocrite; furthermore, he learns in a graphic way that he will displace others who may be equally or more worthy from this expensive and exclusive treatment.  Steelman realizes that the dilemma he faces has placed him in the crucible of his life. "

                "The seismic shifts in American life in the years following World War II have inspired several generations of novelists, but few have described the fallout of those changes as poignantly and with as much understanding as Gerald Green did in The Last Angry Man, published in 1956.  At a time when the world had begun to focus on angry young men, Green created a magnificently angry old one as his hero.  Based on his father, the title character is a doctor and a man of principle whose life's work is about to be examined for the first time.    Dr. Sam Abelman is tough and irascible, but he is dedicated healer and a good man guided by a belief in basic human decency -- the right doctor for the poor and disadvantaged who fill the slums and tenements of Brooklyn.  His relationship with his patients is sometimes explosive, especially as the world is changing and becoming more dangerous.  Into this mix comes a hard-driving television producer, who learns about Dr. Abelman and wants to feature the doctor on his reality-based network show, Americans USA.  To get Abelman to participate is not easy, and it calls for schmoozing that verges on a complete con of the principled old man.  As tragedy looms, Abelman, whose difficult life is a living testament to his beliefs, becomes a true hero in the eyes of producer, for all the reasons that made him an impossible subject for the show.    The Last Angry Man is dedicated to \"Samuel Greenberg, M.D. 1886-1952,\" the father of the author who practiced medicine in the heart of Brooklyn's cultural melting pot.  Gerald Green knew his father's world, but he had left it as an adult.  As he developed as a novelist, he became a writer, director and producer at NBC-TV in its early days.  His behind-the-scenes knowledge of the emerging television industry was thorough and complete, and his perspective allowed him -- almost 50 years ago -- to understand the acute irony of applying media celebrity to such a man as his fictional hero, Dr. Sam Abelman.  The Last Angry Man is written with passion and fierce affection, and it also richly captures the raucous energy and the tough humanity of a now-vanished New York.  \"A tremendous novel,\" the Chicago Sun-Times wrote of The Last Angry Man, and The Atlantic Monthly noted, \"You are lifted and swept along as you read.\" "

                "The Holocaust becomes a breathtaking personal drama, in the midst of a vast cataclysm, in William Styron's Sophie's Choice, a big and questing novel with autobiographical elements and a fearless determination to explore a particular human dimension of a historical nightmare.  The novel speaks through the voice of Styron's alter ego, a polite young Tidewater Virginian called Stingo who comes to New York in 1947 in the hopes of being a writer.  With a small legacy that will enable him to devote himself to writing, Stingo lands in a boarding house in deepest Brooklyn.  There he befriends an irresistible character named Nathan Landau, a compelling but deeply disturbed Jewish intellectual who has nursed back to health a beautiful Polish war victim, Sophie Zawistowska, who is now his lover.  Stingo revels in his time with his new friends but gradually becomes aware of the shadows that surround them.  Their relationship is tormented, even violent.  Sophie begins to describe to Stingo her experiences during the war, when-as a Polish Catholic, the daughter of a law professor and the married mother of two-she was persecuted with all the viciousness the Nazis could muster.  Her husband and father were murdered, and she and her children were sent to Auschwitz.  Sophie lived through it, amazingly, but only in the technical sense, an act of survival that begins with an awful decision she was forced to make.  With her unstable lover, she now waits for a fate that seems, to Stingo, as inevitable as it is tragic.  Sophie's Choice is a rare event in late-20th-century American fiction-a bold, substantial novel with serious themes that also tells a riveting story.  Styron meditates frequently on the historical dimension of the Holocaust and how such a thing could happen, letting the matter resonate with his own knowledge of oppression that occurred in the American South.  The characters are powerfully and engagingly drawn, often with wit and humor, and the novel speaks with great humanity.  \"It belongs on that small shelf reserved or American masterpieces,\" Paul Fussell wrote in the Washington Post Book World.  \"'Sophie's Choice' is in the main stream of the American novel.  Like 'A Portrait of a Lady' or 'The Great Gatsby,' it is ... wonderfully human.\" "

                "Readers know Pat Conroy as a novelist of great reputation and success, but his first notable achievement as a writer was an autobiographical book called The Water Is Wide, published in 1972 -- the story of a year in his life as a teacher of poor African-American children on a coastal island in South Carolina. The New York Times called The Water Is Wide \"a hell of a good story,\" and that observation points to one of Conroy's supreme gifts as a writer of fiction -- the ability to craft an irresistible narrative.    In his later novels, Conroy has used details from his own life and experience, though The Water Is Wide is vibrantly told in the first person by Conroy himself.  After graduating from The Citadel, Conroy returned to Beaufort, S.C., to teach in the same high school he attended a few years earlier.  The time was the late 1960s, and his idealism and his frustration with the complacent world to which he had returned soon inspired him to apply to the Peace Corps.  The Peace Corps did not respond, so he impulsively decided to go after an unusual job he had heard about -- teaching virtually illiterate children in an old-fashioned school house on Yamacraw Island, reached only by boat, a sad but lushly beautiful place the 20th century had almost completely bypassed.     Whatever he expected, what Conroy found on Yamacraw was far worse.  The school received little in the way of support, financially or otherwise, and the situation forced Conroy to improvise wildly as a teacher.  His students never seemed to grasp his name, so he became known as \"Conrack.\"  He spent a year teaching on Yamacraw, succeeding sometimes by teasing and cajoling his demoralized students into learning and even getting excited about a world beyond their misery on the island.  Inevitably, he was too successful -- his freewheeling methods and exuberant energy alarmed the school authorities, who fired him.  The experience clearly transformed Conroy, as it must have transformed the children he taught, though he had few illusions in the end.  \"Of the Yamacraw children I can say little,\" he wrote in conclusion, \"For them I leave a single prayer: that the river is good to them in the crossing.\" "

                "The suspense and the excitement are so intoxicating in Paul Brickhill's 1950 novel The Great Escape that it is easy to forget what a frightening, life-and-death struggle its characters have undertaken.  They are British and American prisoners of war in a Nazi stalag (or POW camp), determined to burrow their way to escape and make the dangerous dash for freedom across occupied Europe.  Through the 1963 film adaptation, starring Steve McQueen, the story has become well-known.  Brickhill's novel reflects more of the actual process of planning and executing the escape, the painstaking detail and the incredible will behind a remarkable act of heroism.  Led by a fearless Englishman named Roger Bushell, the inmates of Stalag Luft III, both British and American, come together to plan a mass escape from their Nazi captors.  Their task is formidable, to dig their way out of the camp in a network of tunnels while creating themselves the papers, clothing and simulated weapons they will need to escape through occupied territory.  The men face a bewildering number of reversals of fortune, starting over each time a little wiser about what it takes to outfox the Germans.  They must not only evade the German officers who run the camp but also the \"ferrets,\" who are constantly on guard for any suspicious activity.  The whole wildly improbable mission requires the most sensitive coordination and complete trust in an enemy prison camp in the middle of a worldwide war -- any escape, it seems under these circumstances, would be a \"great\" escape.  Australian-born Paul Brickhill was himself a prisoner of war of the Germans, and he participated in just such a mass escape from a German stalag.  Using fiction to heighten the drama, he creates in The Great Escape a gallery of memorable characters and carefully charts -- literally, at certain points, with drawings and maps -- their ingenuity, their success and failures, and their courageous hope.  \"One of the great true stories of the war, and one of the greatest escape narratives of all time,\" the San Francisco Chronicle wrote of The Great Escape.  The Dallas Times-Herald noted that the novel \"puts the average war book so far in the shadow it's not even funny.\" "

                "The Great Santini is an affecting coming-of-age story that does not blink in its depiction of a tight and loving family on the edge of disaster.  Set in the rich, sleepy atmosphere of coastal South Carolina in the early 1960s, the novel echoes the timeless tension that emerges between vigorous fathers and their maturing sons, the inevitable clash of personal pride and selfless love, the jealous frustration that comes with maturity.  Bull Meecham, known to all as \"The Great Santini,\" can't push his son Ben hard enough; to show affection or proud pleasure in Ben's accomplishment would never occur to him.  For Ben, his father's relentless bullying has become more than a frustration, and he is no longer able to suffer his father's abuse.  The binding force in the Meecham family is Lillian, Bull's wife and Ben's mother, a beautiful Southern woman of seemingly limitless patience and deference, but indomitable will.  She holds her family together, a firewall for her husband's worst authoritarian excesses.  Yet she is also sympathetic to the impossible position in which Ben finds himself, at a pivotal moment in his maturity -- the man-child of a father who is defiantly unwilling to yield.    Bull Meecham is a vivid and explosive character with whom the reader comes to terms, as Ben does.  Conroy, admirably, does not sentimentalize Bull.  The clear-eyed, often funny progress of his story reminds us how close to home it is; the characters and the conflict are founded on the author's own difficult relationship with his father, a Marine Corps colonel who was a pilot like Bull Meecham.  (Conroy, perhaps tellingly, imagines a dire fate for Bull that his own father was spared.)  The publication of The Great Santini seems to have wrought a powerful effect on Conroy's family -- his paternal grandparents were so offended that they shunned him, and his mother used the novel as evidence when she divorced Conroy's father.  It also established Conroy as a great teller of stories and an interesting new voice in American fiction, unabashed in its expressive power and hard-won sensitivity. "

                "The 20th century was not very old when Chicago played host to what was freely billed \"the crime of the century.\"  It happened in 1924, when two rich young men kidnapped and murdered a boy simply to exercise what they believed to be their superior intellectual skills.  Both Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were sons of wealthy Jewish families in Chicago, arrogant in their sense of entitlement, sure they were above the law.  Their vicious kidnapping and killing of Bobby Franks horrified the world, and the two were spared the death penalty only as the result of an extraordinary appeal by their defense attorney, the legendary Clarence Darrow.    Novelist Meyer Levin covered the Leopold-Loeb trial as a student reporter and, some  30 years later, returned to the subject -- and the reporter's perspective -- in novelized form in Compulsion, published in 1956.  Fiction allowed Levin to project himself inside the heads of the murderers (Leopold was still alive and in prison at the time), to explore elements in their behavior -- such as their homosexual tendencies -- not easily confronted at that time.   The novel transforms Leopold and Loeb into Judd Steiner and Artie Strauss, their victim into Paulie Kessler and their defense attorney into Jonathan Wilk.  Levin's novel is in two parts, \"The Crime of the Century\" and \"The Trial of the Century.\"  It explores the reasons the young men chose to commit a \"perfect\" crime -- a crime that was otherwise meaningless -- and it dramatizes the remarkable summation by their attorney that saved them from the gallows.    Interestingly, the publication (and subsequent film adaptation) of Compulsion angered one person -- Nathan Leopold, who had been an exemplary and even heroic prisoner, and was paroled in 1958, after Erle Stanley Gardner and Carl Sandburg testified at his parole hearing.  (Loeb, who had become surly and violent in prison, was murdered there in a knife fight in 1936.)  Leopold was offended by the novel and film, and he sued both Meyer Levin and the film's producer Richard Zanuck for invasion of privacy.  The case dragged for over a decade; when it was decided in 1970, Leopold was ruled to be a public figure and not entitled to the protection of privacy.  He died the following year. "

                "To tell his story, Tom Wingo, the scarred but proud hero of Pat Conroy's The Prince of Tides, must go on a journey -- a literal, geographical journey to New York from his home on the South Carolina coast that leads to a psychological journey from the present to the past, to a virtual prison of memory.  What he finds there is both terrible and liberating, for him and for his whole broken but remarkable family.  Ambitious and intoxicating, The Prince of Tides is Conroy's biggest and most popular novel, a lushly evocative but riveting tale of redemption and renewal.  Tom Wingo is a high-school football coach, temporarily out of a job, living with his wife and children on the South Carolina coast, where he has always lived.  He learns that his twin sister, Savannah, a troubled but successful feminist poet, has made yet another suicide attempt in New York.  He goes to New York to take care of her, and her psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lowenstein, ask him to help in reconstructing Savannah's past. Tom stays in New York for several months, submitting to intensive therapy in the hope of helping his sister, while becoming closer to Dr. Lowenstein.  Savannah had been a fragile creature since childhood, given to hallucinations and suicidal impulses, but Dr. Lowenstein leads Tom to discover that the reasons are dark and violent, involving the whole family, and that he is their victim as well.  Published in 1986, The Prince of Tides is dedicated to Conroy's entire family.  It is not about his family, though inevitably elements in the story resonate with his own experience.  What is important is the conviction with which he demonstrates the powerful grip of a family's pathology -- something most readers can recognize, on some level, and one of the reasons for the novel's great success.  The character of Tom Wingo is among the author's finest creations, a good man who very badly wants to make things right -- like most Conroy heroes, a man in a bad situation, struggling to find an honorable way out.  Conroy tells Tom's sprawling story with skill and abandon, and with a fearless reach for the most lyrical and heartfelt expression of a man, seemingly, learning to breathe again. "

                "Eugene Iretnev had everything he need to succeed in life; an admirable education at home, high honours when he graduated in law at Petersburg University, and connections in the highest society through his recently deceased father. His one downfall was his love and sexual affair for a peasant woman. Once married, he tried to discontinue his \"meetings\" with the peasant woman, but found it to be impossible to live with... He must kill one of them... his wife or the peasant woman... or maybe himself. This great story is written with two alternate endings.  Please Note:  This book is easy to read in true text, not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher.  The Microsoft eBook has a contents page linked to the chapter headings for easy navigation. The Adobe eBook has bookmarks at chapter headings and is printable up to two full copies per year.  Both versions are text searchable. "

Among his plays,  The Importance of Being Earnest \u2014the last he wrote\u2014is certainly the most celebrated. H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw thought it one of the funniest plays ever written, and it has continued to amuse theatergoers the world over for more than a century. The play pokes fun at the aristocracy, the literary world, and British manners and customs, while calling into question the very notion of \u201cidentity.\u201d The characters\u2019 plans are constantly sent topsy-turvy by unexpected turns of events. Along the way, Wilde\u2019s wit-sharpened dialogue skewers nearly everyone, throwing into high relief the strains of class pretension, social ambition, and romantic gamesmanship.  Readers who have enjoyed Oscar Wilde\u2019s barbed prose will find his pointed dramatic dialogue equally enticing. "

                "Daisy Miller, a young woman from Schenectady, New York, arrives in Switzerland with her mother and younger brother to visit her aunt. They are on holiday from the United States where her father is a successful businessman, a member of the nouveau riche. Mrs. Miller wants to try her daughter out on the European social regime which includes complex and detailed layers of conduct by which judgement is rendered on the participants. A certain amount of useful knowledge can protect an innocent from her own vulnerability. Unfortunately, Daisy is spirited but without the ability to curb her quick enthusiasm. She doesn't have the social experience to be unconventional. In Switzerland she meets 27-year-old Frederick Winterbourne who is from America but grew up and was educated in Geneva. When he and Daisy meet at the beginning of the story their behavior is spontaneous, and Winterbourne is drawn by her flirtatious ways. The tale continues as a studious consideration of Daisy through Frederick's eyes. Because he is older and differently schooled he spends his energy trying to decipher her manner and intent. He detects her unwillingness to follow the customary demeanor of other girls who match her age and social rank. Daisy meets another man, an impoverished Italian, who takes her on unescorted excursions. They are seen together and criticized for these unchaperoned situations. When Winterbourne is a witness to one of these questionable outings he steps away from any more pursuit of Daisy. She becomes ill with fever in Rome. Frederick visits her during this sickness until she dies. This narrative outlines the conflict between artifice and infatuation. This is one of Henry James most succinct and direct accounts of the interplay between social standings.

                "Early nineteenth century English society imposed many requirements for a successful life. Women, to maintain a comfortable economic condition, needed to make the conventions of class and wealth important when they came of marrying age. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett had five daughters to present before whatever eligibly prosperous men were available. This story centers on the Bennetts' daughter Elizabeth who will be most resistant to any financially stable marriage which has no room for romance. Because Elizabeth has her sights set on happiness, she employs her intelligence and quick response to keep an edge on suitors like Mr. Collins whose overdone manner combined with unassertive demands make him totally undesirable. Elizabeth is sure of her ability to accurately judge the quality of others. But Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy who is rich and aristocratic. He becomes a rather unwelcome presence in her life even though he is a close friend of her sister's beau. Elizabeth mistakenly believes that Darcy has a disagreeable tendency to hate everyone, but the longer she knows him she is shown through event and example how generous and capable he is. The novel becomes a discovery of true love as Darcy and Elizabeth reconcile the conceits of prejudice and pride that had hidden the possibility of pleasure.

                "Edmond Dantes, a sailor, returns home to Marseilles with the cargo he was assigned to retrieve and news of the death of that ship's captain. After making his report to the boss of the shipping company he is promoted to captain because of his loyalty and perserverance and joins his fiance to plan their wedding. On his wedding day he is arrested and falsely accused as a traitorous Napoleonic conspirator and sent to the Isle Chateau D'If where he is to remain imprisoned for the rest of his life and suffer unrelenting torture. In this prison after seven years and almost giving up hope, he meets Abbe Faria who is also sentenced to be incarcerated on the Isle forever. Faria is quite old but is digging a tunnel to the sea where he plans to escape. The Abbe sees that Dantes' depression is the real prison, not the lack of nourishing food and strengthening activity, so Faria begins to teach Dantes languages, politics, law, mathematics, science, and fencing. Faria becomes a father figure to Dantes. But after 14 years the Abbe has a terrible accident while tunnelling and will soon die because of it. He tells Dantes how to escape and gives him the location of a great treasure. Dantes slips through the guards' fingers, finds the treasure which makes him as rich as a country, and calls himself The Count of Monte Cristo to conceal his true identity. But Dantes has spent his 14 years in prison devising the ruination of those \"friends\" who abandoned him to devastation. He believes that happiness must be fed by great suffering, therefore he constructs a Godlike deportment to win the trust and confidence of the long-lost acquaintances so that his revenge will be complete and their downfall will be downright termination. When the last target is felled, The Count of Monte Cristo goes away quickly and leaves this message: \"Wait and hope.\"  Please Note:  This book is easy to read in true text, not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher.
