Considered together, the discussions of these concepts advertise in a most dramatic fashion the intellectual barriers currently existing between Chinese and Western thinkers. More importantly, these discussions reformulate Chinese and Western vocabularies in a manner that will enhance the possibilities of intercultural communication.\"--Jacket. "

                "Annotation The linguistic turn in German philosophy was initiated in the eighteenth century in the work of Johann Georg Hamann, Johann Gottfried von Herder, and Wilhelm von Humboldt. It was further developed in this century by Martin Heidegger, and Hans-Georg Gadamer extended its influence to contemporary philosophers such as Karl-Otto Apel and J?Habermas. This tradition focuses on the world-disclosing dimension of language, emphasizing its communicative over its cognitive function. Although this study is concerned primarily with the German tradition of linguistic philosophy, it is very much informed by the parallel linguistic turn in Anglo-American philosophy, especially the development of theories of direct reference. Cristina Lafont draws upon Hilary Putnam's work in particular to criticize the linguistic idealism and relativism of the German tradition, which she traces back to the assumption that meaning determines reference. Part I is a reconstruction of the linguistic turn in German philosophy from Hamann to Gadamer. Part II offers the deepest account to date of Habermas's approach to language. Part III shows how the shortcomings of German linguistic philosophy can be avoided by developing a consistent and more defensible version of Habermas' theory of communicative rationality. "

It connects long-standing philosophical questions about work and human growth to questions about teacher motivation, identity, and development. Makes a significant contribution to the philosophy of teaching and also offers new insights into virtue theory and professional ethics. Offers fresh and detailed readings of major figures in ethics, including Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, and Bernard Williams and the practical philosophies of Hannah Arendt, John Dewey and Hans-Georg Gadamer. Provides illustrations to assist the reader in visualizing major points, and integrates sources such as film, literature, and teaching memoirs to exemplify arguments in an engaging and accessible way. Presents a compelling vision of teaching as a reflective practice showing how this requires us to prepare teachers differently \"-- Provided by publisher. "

                "That Herman Melville was a philosophical fiction writer may be generally accepted, but the implications of this definition are unclear. In Melville's Muse, John Wenke discusses what it means - both biographically and textually - for Melville to combine philosophy and aesthetics. Wenke focuses on Melville's failures and successes in developing fictional forms to contain and express metaphysical speculations. He examines how the author appropriated and transformed elements of his Calvinist-Lutheran heritage; his eclectic reading in ancient, Renaissance, and contemporary writings; his Romantic Zeitgeist; and his cultural and political milieu. Through his analysis, he clearly shows that consciously articulated life choices led Melville to create texts that are both derivative and revolutionary. This study offers a new interpretation of some existing materials but also provides many specific discoveries of Melville's use of Plato, Francois Rabelais, Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, Robert Burton, Sir Thomas Browne, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Shelley, Thomas Carlyle, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, among others. It combines traditional historicism with contemporary theoretical practice, resulting in an interdisciplinary jargon-free critical narrative. Of particular interest to specialists in Melvillean studies, American Romanticism, and 19th-century American literature, it also will appeal to scholars of philosophy and literature, literature and culture, and literary criticism.

Returning to the classical debate between realists and formalists, he shows how the opposing positions may be harmonized and united. He accepts the realist claim that films somehow \"capture\" reality, but agrees with the formalist belief that they transform it. Extending his earlier work on meaning in art and life, he suggests that the meaningfulness of movies derives from techniques that re-create reality in the process of presenting it to viewers who have learned how to appreciate the aesthetics of cinematic transformation.

Based upon the original teachings of the great sage Laozi, it has only ever been taught to close students of the masters chosen as the heads of the ancient orders. For the first time in the English language, this book describes the philosophy, principles and practice of Nei Gong. The author provides a breakdown of the entire Nei Gong process, and explains in plain English the philosophy which underpins Nei Gong practice, and which is based on the original teachings of the ancient Daoist priests. The methodology of Sung breathing, an advanced meditative practice which has until now been reserved for 'inner-door' students is described, and the book contains an entire set of Qigong exercises accompanied by instructional photographs and drawings. This book will be of interest to all practitioners of Qi Gong, martial arts and meditation, and will be a rewarding read for anyone interested in Eastern philosophy. "

                "That Herman Melville was a philosophical fiction writer may be generally accepted, but the implications of this definition are unclear. In Melville's Muse, John Wenke discusses what it means - both biographically and textually - for Melville to combine philosophy and aesthetics. Wenke focuses on Melville's failures and successes in developing fictional forms to contain and express metaphysical speculations. He examines how the author appropriated and transformed elements of his Calvinist-Lutheran heritage; his eclectic reading in ancient, Renaissance, and contemporary writings; his Romantic Zeitgeist; and his cultural and political milieu. Through his analysis, he clearly shows that consciously articulated life choices led Melville to create texts that are both derivative and revolutionary. This study offers a new interpretation of some existing materials but also provides many specific discoveries of Melville's use of Plato, Francois Rabelais, Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, Robert Burton, Sir Thomas Browne, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Shelley, Thomas Carlyle, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, among others. It combines traditional historicism with contemporary theoretical practice, resulting in an interdisciplinary jargon-free critical narrative. Of particular interest to specialists in Melvillean studies, American Romanticism, and 19th-century American literature, it also will appeal to scholars of philosophy and literature, literature and culture, and literary criticism.
