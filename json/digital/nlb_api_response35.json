                "In this lush and terrifying debut\u2014perfect for readers of The Hunger Games and Children of Blood and Bone\u2014Camila Victoire creates a future where cruelty and spectacle hold the keys to subjugating humans on a ravaged earth.  At the end of the twenty-first century, climate change and famine almost ended humanity\u2014until the discovery of the Klujns, a barbaric, humanoid species with strangely colored eyes and even stranger abilities. Their crystal claws and bones fertilize barren soil, and their tender meat is a super-protein. Klujns are both humans' saviors and natural-born enemies, meant to be hunted and used.  When sixteen-year-old Ava finds herself on the wrong side of a military fence erected to protect the North American Territory, she's captured by Klujns and made to participate in the Blood Race, a macabre tradition where young human hostages compete to the death for Klujn amusement. At first, she is terrified, but as Ava observes Klujn behavior that contradicts what she's learned, she begins to wonder: Are Klujns as different as she was led to believe? And, as she fights for her life, does it matter?  Inspired by four years on the road with a traveling circus, where the word itself embodies an entire culture built on dark spectacle, Camila Victoire delivers a twisted coming-of-age tale that combines elements of fantasy, magical realism, and suspense. Blood Circus will capture fans of Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games and Tomi Adeyemi's Children of Blood and Bone. Its masterful worldbuilding, plot twists, and boundary-pushing Blood Race are wholly immersive\u2014and compel readers to call their own long-held assumptions, values, and belief systems into question.

Zuberi, Uzochi, and Lencho were among the first of a new generation of Nubians to awaken to extraordinary powers\u2014gifts their parents lost when they fled their island home decades ago. And now that Uzochi has been declared a Nubian catalyst, everyone expects him to lead. But what should be a time of rebirth and celebration is instead one of turmoil. The so-called sky king, Krazen St. John, is bent on harnessing Nubian gifts for himself, and he has assembled a special, superhuman militia to do his bidding, putting a ruthless Lencho in charge. Facing down his cousin feels insurmountable for Uzochi, even with Zuberi at his side, but now there\u2019s more at stake than the hostile government of Tri-State East. Uzochi\u2019s training has led him to discover an ancient, forgotten force hungry for conquest\u2014and it won\u2019t stop until all of Tri-State East . . . and possibly the world . . . is under its control.

A foundling raised by his wizard master, young Tristan has led an isolated life, and is frustrated because he has no friends and can't do anything right, even small tasks like frying fish, drying clothes, or cleaning the hearth going dreadfully wrong. Then a talking cat with a practical attitude comes into his life and helps him when things go wrong once his master goes away for a few days and problems snowball, until Tristan has to set out into the forest on a quest--to find a hive of bees. The most magical moments come when he encounters a unicorn trapped in the swamp, but the story's real charm is in the down-to-earth details of dealing with things like chickens and foxes, which ought to appeal to fantasy fans both young and old.\"--Carolyn Cushman, Locus.

Sprague de Camp, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, and many other modern writers. The Book of Wonder is Dunsany at his peak of his talent. The stories here are a lush tapestry of language, conjuring images of people, places, and things which cannot possibly exist, yet somehow ring true. They are, in short, full of wonder. Together with Dunsany's other major collections, A Dreamer's Tales and Tales of Three Hemispheres, they are a necessary part of any fantasy collection. "

A powerful saga of three teens, the children of refugees from a fallen African utopia, who must navigate their newfound powers in a climate-ravaged New York City. Perfect for fans of  Black Panther  and  Children of Blood and Bone .   For Zuberi, Uzochi, and Lencho, Nubia is a mystery. Before they were born, a massive storm destroyed their ancestral homeland, forcing their families to flee across the ocean to New York City. Nubia, a utopic island nation off the coast of West Africa, was no more, and their parents\u2019 sorrow was too deep for them to share much of their history beyond the folklore.  But New York, ravaged by climate change and class division, is far from a safe haven for refugees, and Nubians live as outcasts, struggling to survive in the constantly flooding lower half of Manhattan, while the rich thrive in the tech-driven sky city known as the Up High.  To many, being Nubian means you\u2019re fated for a life plagued by difficulties and disrespect. But Zuberi, Uzochi, and Lencho are beginning to feel there might be more. Something within them is changing, giving each of them extraordinary powers. Extraordinary and terrifying powers that seem to be tied to the secrets their parents have kept from them.  And there are people Up High watching, eager to do anything they can to become even more powerful than they already are. Now Zuberi, Uzochi, and Lencho will be faced with the choice\u2014do they use their inheritance to lift their people, or to leave them behind. The fate of their city, and their people, hangs in the balance. "

Now they and Ashley sit in a maximum security prison where the authorities conduct experiments on them to learn the secrets of long life. Earlier, the world's acceptance of dragonkind crumbled, and the Enforcers took the infant twins born to Billy and Bonnie and stole Excalibur, hoping to develop a weapon to battle the dragons that are sure to try to rescue their allies. All the while, a great secret from the past is being revealed to Bonnie through a dream. Joran and Selah, teenaged children of Methuselah, have been trapped in a strange world for centuries, yet still able to manipulate certain events in our world during that time. The fate of all prisoners now rests on the Bannisters' two teenagers who must battle demons, a sorceress, and soldiers in a military compound in order to rescue parents they don't even know. "

Newbery Honor author Catherine Gilbert Murdock's Da Vinci's Cat is a thrilling, time-slip fantasy about rewriting history to save the present.

Federico doesn't mind being a political hostage in the Pope's palace, especially now that he has a cat as a friend.

Even stranger is Herbert, apparently an art collector from the future, who emerges from the wardrobe the next night. Herbert barters with Federico to get a sketch signed by the famous painter Raphael, but his plans take a dangerous turn when he hurries back to his era, desperate to save a dying girl.  Bee never wanted to move to New Jersey. When a neighbor shows Bee a sketch that perfectly resembles her, Bee, freaked out, solidifies her resolve to keep to herself. But then she meets a friendly cat and discovers a mysterious cabinet in her neighbor's attic\u2014a cabinet that leads her to Renaissance Rome. Bee, who has learned about Raphael and Michelangelo in school, never expected she'd get to meet them and see them paint their masterpieces.   This compelling time-slip adventure by Newbery Honor author Catherine Gilbert Murdock is full of action, mystery, history, art, and friendship\u2014and features one unforgettable cat.   Includes black-and-white spot art throughout of Da Vinci's cat by Caldecott Medalist Paul O. Zelinsky, as well as an author's note about the art, artists, and history that inspired the novel . "

What's more, Houdini's offering Harry a chance to go back in time and experience it for himself. Should Harry ignore what must be a hoax? Or should he give it a try and take Houdini up on this death-defying offer?

                "Twelve-year-old Adam is whisked away from his imperfect but quiet life with the arrival of a stranger and a magical promise in this time travel mystery.   It's 1999 and Adam doesn't mind living at his uncle's bakery, the Biscuit Basket, on the Lower East Side in New York City. The warm, delicious smells of freshly baked breads and chocolate croissants make every day feel cozy, even if Adam doesn't have many friends and he misses his long dead parents very much. When a mysterious but cheerful customer shows Adam a snow globe and says that adventures await him, it's too strange to be true. But days later, an unbelievable, incredible thing happens. Adam finds a similar looking snow globe and immediately travels back in time, first to Times Square in 1935, then a candle factory fire in 1967. But how are these times related? What do they have to do with his parents' death? And why is a tall man with long eyebrows and a thin mustache following Adam's every move? In her debut novel G. Z. Schmidt has crafted a world filled with serendipity, mystery, and adventure for readers of Roald Dahl and Lemony Snicket. "

This series inspires young people to pursue faith, courage, and love and to dig deep within to find their God-given strengths, no matter how difficult the circumstances. This book is a prequel to the Dragon in our Midst series (DIOM), covering the events that led up to Raising Dragons, the first DIOM book. The second book in Oracles of Fire, Enoch's Ghost, picks up where Tears of a Dragon, the fourth book in DIOM, left off. Therefore, the second, third, and fourth books in Oracles of Fireare sequels to DIOM. This book is designed to be read after the DIOM series and will launch a new adventure that continues through the next three books. Readers familiar with DIOM will recognize characters from that series and will be introduced to new ones as well. Readers unfamiliar with DIOM will have no trouble following this new story, because no knowledge of DIOM will be required. "

So when tough-as-nails seventeen-year-old Leica is caught doing just that, she's exiled and left to the mercy of Gabriel's unforgiving desert for the rest of her life.  While in exile, Leica discovers a mysterious shuttle, which may not only lead her home, but even more impossible\u2014reestablish contact with Earth. Then Red Death rears its head again, killing her entire work crew, leaving Leica all alone until a handsome Curador offers her refuge in the Dome\u2014the only place on Gabriel untouched by Red Death, where a decadent and sultry life awaits. But there's a catch: Leica can only enter the Dome as his concubine\u2014his Kisaeng. When a rogue group of Citizens see their chance for revolution in Leica's good fortune, she finds herself unraveling a deadly mystery with chilling answers to the true origin of Red Death and the reason Earth really abandoned them so long ago.\u00a0 A richly imagined tale in the vein of Tamora Pierce,  Lotus and Thorn \u00a0is a magnificent, epic fantasy adventure.

Nearly everyone that Lyric Walker loves is either missing or presumed dead, including the mesmerizing prince Fathom. It's up to Lyric to unite the Alpha before the second wave of a cataclysmic invasion wipes out mankind for good. The Undertow trilogy is an unforgettable reading experience that author E. Lockhart calls, \"Allegorical and romantic, the book nevertheless reads like an action movie with especially awesome CGI.\" "

                "The classic science fiction horror novel of possessed children that inspired the terrifying  Village of the Damned  films.     In John Wyndam's classically elegant, calm style, this novel explores the arrival of a collective intelligence on earth that threatens to eliminate mankind. The quiet, eerie changes that befall Midwich manifest in strange ways: On the surface, everything seems normal, but scratch a little deeper and there is a clear sense of dread. After the night of September 26, every woman of childbearing age is pregnant, all to give birth at the same time, to children who are all alike\u2014their eyes mesmerizing, void of emotion. These children are innately possessed with unimaginable mental powers and a formidable intelligence. It is these children who develop into an unstoppable force, capable of anything and far out-reaching other humans in cunning. Whatever dwells in Midwich is sowing the seeds for a master race of ruthless and inhumane creatures who are bent on nothing less than absolute and total domination.    The  London Evening Standard  called  The Midwich Cuckoos  \"humane and urbane with a lightly sophisticated wit putting the ideas into shape.\" Wyndham skillfully heightens the terror by making his narrative so rational and matter-of-fact. In such a nuclear and technological age, this story is rich in irony in that it is set in the picturesque, bucolic English Village and the \"enemy,\" or, the threat is seeming cherubim.    \"Exciting, unsettling and technically brilliant.\" \u2014 The Spectator.

                "Ages ago the continent was invaded by massive armies intent on creating a new home for themselves. The peaceful indigenous peoples fled before the marauding hordes and hid defiantly in the mountain peaks awaiting a signal from god. They learned the arts of magic and warfare as they hid from the intruders, who divided the land amongst themselves and set up a civilization where the many toil and slave for the elite few.  The Forgotten Legacy series begins with  Young Lord of Khadora  as Marak, a young soldier in the service of one of the clans of Khadora is chosen as a sacrifice for the benefit of his lord. Marak is sent on a fool\u2019s mission to defeat one of the small bands of indigenous people known as the Chula, a race of dreaded cat-people.  Marak, however, is not your normal clan soldier. His mother is a mage slave to the clan lord and his father is unknown, presumed dead. What makes Marak different though, is his abhorrence for Khadoran culture, a society that feeds on the helpless and victimizes all but the most wealthy and powerful. Refusing to accept his given role in life, Marak sets out to change the very fabric of society.  The young soldier has a brilliant military mind and warrior skills that so far have not been bested, but his real weapons are the resources that Khadoran society discards. In Khadora mages are typically slaves who tend the fields, often thought of as little more than farm implements. The average Khadoran soldier is taught to follow orders and not think. The workers on the clan estates are treated barely better than the slaves.  Marak intends to use a secret weapon to not only accomplish the futile mission he is sent on, but to start a reform of the entire society. His weapon is compassion and it is an emotion that has long been dead in Khadora.  It is a fine edge that Marak must walk to stay alive. While not knowing how a populace will react to his endeavors, Marak has little doubt what the reactions of the clan lords will be. Marak will have to defend himself against rival clan lords fearful of his efforts, the dreaded cat-people who hate all Khadorans, and even his own clan to whom he owes his very life and allegiance. "

                "Volume 3 of the Targa Trilogy      Ages ago, elves and dwarves unknowingly migrated between Universes via a Junction. Jenneva and Egam believe they have found a Junction and plan a trip with Alexander to test the theory and investigate the origins of the elves and dwarves. Because they believe that the perennial animosity between the two races is due to misunderstandings about their histories, the mages include the prince of elves and the prince of dwarves in the group.       Trouble begins at the very start of the journey as Egam falters going through the Junction, awakening an old nemesis, the evil demon, Alutar. It appears that the excursion will not just clarify history, but also actually change it.      As the group discovers they are trapped in the new Universe, the shocking truth of the real history of the races is overshadowed by impending doom as an ancient prophecy begins to unfold.       Meanwhile, the evil sorcerer, Sarac, not only gains freedom from his imprisonment, but also gains the blessing of the evil demon, Alutar. With the blessing, Sarac is given new powers and is promised a reign of a thousand years.       The race is on to prevent Sarac from unfettered control of the Universes, as our trio stands incapable of altering the prophecy of destruction. "

A devastating and seemingly senseless attack on the Omunga Academy of Magic leaves Lyra running for her life. Her father, Master Malafar, was kidnapped and her mother was killed during the attack. Her mother\u2019s cryptic dieing words propel Lyra on a journey across the breadth of the country in search of her Uncle Temiker. The raiders of the Academy however have other plans for Lyra as they doggedly pursue her. Trying to stay one step ahead of the raiders, Lyra finds out that the Imperial government wants her head for the very slaughter she narrowly escaped.  With the raiders in pursuit and Imperial troops blocking the roads ahead, Lyra has no chance of survival unless she enters the dreaded Sakova, a land of nightmares. The Sakova, long known as a place of no return, is home to cannibals, ferocious beasts, and strange magic.  The fast pace of her flight leaves Lyra little time to solve the mysteries of the attack, but the questions of why anyone would kidnap her father, or slaughter dozens of innocents to accomplish it, linger as a gnawing distraction.  Discover a world of swords and magic, political intrigue and deceit, and cunning, ruthless people who seek to finish the annihilation of a society that began ages ago. "

                "\"   Fireborne    is everything I want in fantasy.\" \u2014Rachel Hartman,    New York Times    bestselling author of    Seraphina    Game of Thrones meets  Red Rising  in a debut young adult fantasy that's full of rivalry, romance . . . and dragons.   Annie and Lee were just children when a brutal revolution changed their world, giving everyone\u2014even the lowborn\u2014a chance to test into the governing class of dragonriders.  Now they are both rising stars in the new regime, despite backgrounds that couldn't be more different. Annie's lowborn family was executed by dragonfire, while Lee's aristocratic family was murdered by revolutionaries. Growing up in the same orphanage forged their friendship, and seven years of training have made them rivals for the top position in the dragonriding fleet.  But everything changes when survivors from the old regime surface, bent on reclaiming the city.  With war on the horizon and his relationship with Annie changing fast, Lee must choose to kill the only family he has left or to betray everything he's come to believe in. And Annie must decide whether to protect the boy she loves . . . or step up to be the champion her city needs.  From debut author Rosaria Munda comes a gripping adventure that calls into question which matters most: the family you were born into, or the one you've chosen. "
