Augland 54 is the Pacific Northwest's most extravagant theme park. Those with Suits choose the body they want and live the life of their dreams...and those without Suits work for the Artificial Existence Center, or AEC. As long as the workers keep their heads down, Augland provides food and shelter from the post-war world outside its domed walls.  When Ashton is sent to the new Land of Legends park, she discovers that Augland is keeping secrets\u2014inside and outside of its walls\u2014and they're more violent than she ever expected. So she decides to fight back. After all, if Augland is going to make her dress up as a red-headed warrior princess, then she's more than willing to become one.  In a corporation-ruled world inhabited by the augmented bodies of the wealthy, securely cut off from the rest in life-extending pods, Ashton exposes the sham of corporate success and refuses to remain a cog in the machine. The only thing that matters now is freedom. "

At least that's what Ashton thinks until Wolfe leads an attack at the Colony and kidnaps Jagatha.   Heartbroken and once again defeated by Augland, Ashton is forced to decide whether to accept the loss and keep her freedom, or fight against the tyranny of the Suits, even if it means going back into the dome of the Augland park she fought so hard to escape.  Ashton soon discovers that the levels of Augland 54's treachery go far deeper than she ever imagined and the only way to fight it is to become another version of herself. But even with the fa\u00e7ade, Ashton is afraid she is unsuitable to lead the rebellion. Can the workers, exhausted and unprotected, rise up against the augmented and idealized world of the Suits? All Ashton knows is that she refuses to lose anyone else. It's time for the rise of the  UnSuited . "

                "A girl matches wits with a war god in this kaleidoscopic, thought-provoking tale of oppression and the cost of peace, where stories hide within other stories, and narrative has the power to heal \u2014 or to burn everything in its path \u2014 from World Fantasy Award\u2013winning author Alaya Dawn Johnson.       A girl and a god, alone in communion ...     In the winding underground tunnels of the Library, the great peacekeeper of the three systems, a heinous secret lies buried \u2014 and Freida is the only one who can uncover it. As the daughter of a Library god, Freida has spent her whole life exploring the Library's ever-changing tunnels and communing with the gods. Her unparalleled access makes her unique \u2014 and dangerous.    When Freida meets Joshua, a Tierran boy desperate to save his people, and Nerg\u00fci, a Disciple from a persecuted religious minority, Freida is compelled to help them. But in order to do so, she will have to venture deeper into the Library than she has ever known. There she will discover the atrocities of the past, the truth of her origins, and the impossibility of her future.    With the world at the brink of war, Freida embarks on a journey to fulfill her destiny, one that pits her against an ancient war god. Her mission is straightforward: Destroy the god before he can rain hellfire upon thousands of innocent lives \u2014 if he doesn't destroy her first. "

[A] strong and intricate story.\" \u2014 Kirkus Reviews   This 2022 Colorado Book Award Winner is a rare, searing portrayal of the future of climate change in South Asia. A streetrat turned revolutionary and the disillusioned hacker son of a politician try to take down a ruthlessly technocratic government that sacrifices its poorest citizens to build its utopia.   The South Asian Province is split in two. Uplanders live in a luxurious, climate-controlled biodome, healthy and artificially youthful forever. Outside, the poor and forgotten scrape by with black-market robotics, in slums threatened by rising sea levels, unbreathable air, and deadly superbugs.  Ashiva works for the Red Hand, an underground network of revolutionaries fighting the government, which is run by a merciless computer algorithm. As a smuggler with the best robotic arm and cybernetic enhancements the slums can offer, her cargo includes the city's most vulnerable abandoned children.  When the brilliant Uplander hacker Riz-Ali stumbles into the Red Hand's dangerous activities, he and Ashiva uncover a horrifying conspiracy that the government will do anything to bury. As armed guardians kidnap children, massive robots flatten the slums, and a pandemic threatens to decimate the city, Ashiva and Riz must put aside their differences to fight the system and save the communities they love.

                "In this electric speculative YA sci/fi novel, the world treats memories like currency, so dreams can be a complicated business. Perfect for fans of Neal Stephenson and Philip K. Dick.   In an alternative 1987, a disease ravages human memories. There is no cure, only artificial recall. The lucky ones\u2014the recollectors\u2014need the treatment only once a day.  Freya Izquierdo isn't lucky. The high school senior is a \"degen\" who needs artificial recall several times a day. Plagued by blinding half-memories that take her to her knees, she's desperate to remember everything that will help her investigate her father's violent death. When her sleuthing almost lands her in jail, a shadowy school dean selects her to attend his Foxtail Academy, where five hundred students will trial a new tech said to make artificial recall obsolete.  She's the only degen on campus. Why was she chosen? Freya is nothing like the other students, not even her new friends Ollie, Chase, and the alluring Fletcher Cohen. Definitely not at all like the students who start to vanish, one by one. And nothing like the mysterious Dean Mendelsohn, who has a bunker deep in the woods behind the school.  Nothing can prepare Freya and her friends for the truth of what that bunker holds. And what kind of memories she'll have to access to survive it.   \"Vaca's debut is a thrilling and often unsettling examination of the elusive nature of memory and truth. The Memory Index will leave you breathlessly turning pages until its satisfying conclusion.\"  \u2014Jonathan Evison, New York Times bestselling author of Small World  Get hooked on The Memory Index Duology:  Book 1: The Memory Index  Book 2: The Recall Paradox (coming Spring 2023) "

                "A human boy lives in a world full of clones and the girl who falls in love with him in this dystopian YA novel debut.   Jack is a walking fossil. The only human among a sea of clones. It's been hundreds of years since humanity died off in the slow plague, leaving the clones behind to carry on human existence. Over time they've perfected their genes, moving further away from the imperfections of humanity. But if they really are perfect, why did they create Jack?  While Jack longs for acceptance, Althea-310 struggles with the feeling that she's different from her sisters. Her fascination with Jack doesn't help. As Althea and Jack's connection grows stronger, so does the threat to their lives. What will happen if they do the unthinkable and fall in love?  \"Like the works of Ursula K. LeGuin, inside this lyrically written, suspenseful tale is a deeply humane thematic core.\" \u2014Kirkus Reviews , starred Review  \"We fell for Jack and Althea's romance, which is made to order for fans of  The Giver ,  Delirium  and  Warm Bodies , because woven into this fast-paced and romantic sci-fi is a thoughtful look at what it really means to be human.\" \u2014Justine Magazine     \"A thought-provoking tale that explores conformity, individuality, and what it means to be human...With imaginative, vivid world building, this should appeal to fans of Lauren Oliver's  Replica .\" \u2014Booklist   \"Readers will feel fully immersed in this new reality.

In the series' penultimate novel, the remnants of Britain's last army are called into battle again \u2013 this time to avert the violent deaths of tens of thousands of prisoners. The neurodiverse skills and defiant bravery of the Underdogs are pitched against the might of military science and the terrifying Acceleration project.  Meanwhile, Oliver Roth has been offered a promotion that would make him the second most powerful person in Britain. But it's conditional on the success of his next mission: the discovery and annihilation of Spitfire's Rise.  The Underdogs fight for the safety of countless prisoners, clueless that their home is being hunted. As each side launches their respective attacks, it's only a matter of time until one triumphs decisively over the other. "

Spensa\u2019s life as a Defiant Defense Force pilot has been far from ordinary. She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus  and  she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krell\u2014the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. What\u2019s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home.  \u00a0  Now, the Superiority\u2014the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life\u2014has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa\u2019s seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator.   \u00a0  Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she\u2019s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy.   \u00a0  The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return.   \u00a0  To have courage means facing fear. And this mission is terrifying.

When she unexpectedly finds herself in Colorado, she's tempted by the total eclipse of the sun that's about to happen\u2014and maybe even meeting up with the female scientists she's long admired.

The British population continues its imprisonment in Nicholas Grant's giant walled Citadels, under the watchful eye of innumerable cloned soldiers. The heroes of Oakenfold Special School remain their last chance of freedom. As a result of their last mission, Grant has been forced to speed up his plans for Great Britain and beyond. Ewan, Kate, McCormick and the rest of the Underdogs must face the horrors of his new research, knowing that it raises the stakes as high as they will go. Failing this battle will not merely result in losing soldiers and friends, but in losing the war entirely.  According to the odds, the Underdogs are near-certain to fail. But they have spent their whole lives being underestimated and did not survive this long by respecting the odds. "

England has been radically changed by a series of catastrophes \u2013 large cities have disappeared and London has been replaced by a lagoon. The surviving population exists in fortified towns where they cling to traditional ways, while strangely evolved beasts prowl the wilderness beyond. Conformity is rigidly enforced and those who fall foul of the rules are persecuted: some are killed, others are driven out into the wilds. Only a few fight back \u2013 and two of these outlaws, Scarlett McCain and Albert Browne, display an audacity and talent that makes them legends. "

In an alternative fantasy world where some men are made from clockwork parts and carriages are steam powered, Alasdair Finch, a young mechanic, does the unthinkable after his brother dies: he uses clockwork pieces to bring Oliver back from the dead.  But the resurrection does not go as planned, and Oliver returns more monster than man. Even worse, the novel Frankenstein is published and the townsfolk are determined to find the real-life doctor and his monster. With few places to turn for help, the dangers may ultimately bring the brothers together\u2014or ruin them forever. "

Even in a world where technology connects everyone's minds, it would seem that some secrets can still remain hidden.  For all the mysteries teen hacker Marisa Carneseca has solved, one has always eluded her: When she was two years old, she was in a car accident in which she lost her arm and a mob boss's wife, Zenaida de Maldonado, lost her life. No one can tell her what she was doing in that car, or how it led to the feud between the Carnesecas and the Maldonados.   The secrets from the past rise violently to the surface when Zenaida's freshly severed hand shows up at the scene of a gangland shooting. If Zenaida is\u2014or was\u2014still alive, it means there's even more about Marisa's past that she doesn't know.  And when everyone from Los Angeles gangs to the world's largest genetic engineering firms becomes involved in the case, it's clear there's more happening under the surface than anyone cares to admit.  The truth is out there, and Marisa will have to thread together lost friends, corporate assassins, a gang lord's digital brain, and what might be a literal ghost from the past in order to find it. "

                "Two sisters are torn apart by war and must fight their way back to each other in a futuristic, Black Panther-inspired Nigeria.  The year is 2172. Climate change and nuclear disasters have rendered much of earth unlivable. Only the lucky ones have escaped to space colonies in the sky.  In a war-torn Nigeria, battles are fought using flying, deadly mechs and soldiers are outfitted with bionic limbs and artificial organs meant to protect them from the harsh, radiation-heavy climate. Across the nation, as the years-long civil war wages on, survival becomes the only way of life.  Two sisters, Onyii and Ify, dream of more. Their lives have been marked by violence and political unrest. Still, they dream of peace, of hope, of a future together. And they're willing to fight an entire war to get there. Acclaimed author, Tochi Onyebuchi, has written an immersive, action-packed, deeply personal novel perfect for fans of Nnedi Okorafor, Marie Lu, and Paolo Bacigalupi. "

Speth Jime is anxious to deliver her Last Day speech and celebrate her transition into adulthood. The moment she turns fifteen, Speth must pay for every word she speaks (\"Sorry\" is a flat ten dollars and a legal admission of guilt), for every nod ($0.99/sec), for every scream ($0.99/sec) and even every gesture of affection. She's been raised to know the consequences of falling into debt, and can't begin to imagine the pain of having her eyes shocked for speaking words that she's unable to afford.  But when Speth's friend Beecher commits suicide rather than work off his family's crippling debt, she can't express her shock and dismay without breaking her Last Day contract and sending her family into Collection. Backed into a corner, Speth finds a loophole: rather than read her speech\u2014rather than say anything at all\u2014she closes her mouth and vows never to speak again. Speth's unexpected defiance of tradition sparks a media frenzy, inspiring others to follow in her footsteps, and threatens to destroy her, her family and the entire city around them. "

                "From acclaimed author Makiia Lucier, a dazzling, romantic fantasy inspired by Pacific Island mythology.    In the old tales, it is written that the egg of a seadragon, dragonfruit, holds within it the power to undo a person's greatest sorrow. But as with all things that offer hope when hope had gone, the tale came with a warning.  Every wish demands a price.  Hanalei of Tamarind is the cherished daughter of an old island family. But when her father steals a seadragon egg meant for an ailing princess, she is forced into a life of exile. In the years that follow, Hanalei finds solace in studying the majestic seadragons that roam the Nominomi Sea. Until, one day, an encounter with a female dragon offers her what she desires most. A chance to return home, and to right a terrible wrong.  Samahtitamahenele, Sam, is the last remaining prince of Tamarind. But he can never inherit the throne, for Tamarind is a matriarchal society. With his mother ill and his grandmother nearing the end of her reign. Sam is left with two choices: to marry, or to find a cure for the sickness that has plagued his mother for ten long years. When a childhood companion returns from exile, she brings with her something he has not felt in a very long time-hope.  But Hanalei and Sam are not the only ones searching for the dragonfruit. And as they battle enemies both near and far, there is another danger they cannot escape...that of the dragonfruit itself. "

Centuries after a miracle vanquished Tresttato's monsters and turned the soldiers fighting them to stone, Milo lovingly tends to the statues of those who protected the city. Raised with devout templars and scholars, autistic temple ward Milo wants nothing more than to be accepted into their ranks. When his prayers admiring her heroic sacrifice accidentally free Gia from stone, she wakes with a fury to kill the man Milo owes his life to, Primo Sanct Ennio. Gia claims that the immortal holy leader Milo lives to serve is the same man who betrayed her and transformed her into a statue-and what Milo always believed was a miracle was actually a curse that Gia will stop at nothing to break. Even if she has to kill his followers to do it. Even if she must kill the boy who woke her. "

Unfortunately, Marlowe was the one surprised when Josh dumped her because he'd prefer a girlfriend who's more romantic. One with emotional depth. But Marlowe has never failed anything in her life, and she isn't about to start now. When she's paired with Ashton Hayes for an English project, his black clothing and moody eyeliner cause a bit of a systems overload, and the dissonant sounds of his rock band make her brain itch. But when she discovers Ash's hidden stash of love songs, Marlowe makes a desperate deal to unleash her inner romantic heroine: if Ash will agree to help her write some love letters to win back Josh, she'll calculate the perfect data analytics formula to make Ash's band go viral. As the semester heats up with yearning love notes, a syllabus of romance novels, and late nights spent with a boy who escapes any box her brain tries to put him in, Marlowe starts to question if there's really a set solution to love. Could a girl who's never met a problem she can't solve have gotten the math so massively wrong?. "

                "June Hur, bestselling author of  The Red Palace , crafts a devastating and pulse-pounding tale that will feel all-too-relevant in today's world, based on a true story from Korean history.    Hope is dangerous. Love is deadly.   1506, Joseon.  The people suffer under the cruel reign of the tyrant King Yeonsan, powerless to stop him from commandeering their land for his recreational use, banning and burning books, and kidnapping and horrifically abusing women and girls as his personal playthings. Seventeen-year-old Iseul has lived a sheltered, privileged life despite the kingdom's turmoil. When her older sister, Suyeon, becomes the king's latest prey, Iseul leaves the relative safety of her village, traveling through forbidden territory to reach the capital in hopes of stealing her sister back. But she soon discovers the king's power is absolute, and to challenge his rule is to court certain death.  Prince Daehyun has lived his whole life in the terrifying shadow of his despicable half-brother, the king. Forced to watch King Yeonsan flaunt his predation through executions and rampant abuse of the common folk, Daehyun aches to find a way to dethrone his half-brother once and for all. When staging a coup, failure is fatal, and he'll need help to pull it off\u2014but there's no way to know who he can trust. When Iseul's and Daehyun's fates collide, their contempt for each other is transcended only by their mutual hate for the king. Armed with Iseul's family connections and Daehyun's royal access, they reluctantly join forces to launch the riskiest gamble the kingdom has ever seen: Save her sister. Free the people. Destroy a tyrant.   Also by June Hur:   The Silence of Bones The Forest of Stolen Girls The Red Palace. "

Agnes Chan never expected to be the punchline of her own life . . . But how else do you explain getting accidentally run over and seeing a lifetime of careful preparation, endless training, and all your hopes of a track scholarship to college destroyed in a split second? Not to mention the only witness to your humiliation being your #1 archnemesis, Royce Taslim. So, when Agnes finds a new answer to her scholarship predicament in the form of an international stand-up comedy contest for teens, the last person she expects to be up against is also the last person she wants to see: Royce. Because for years Royce has represented everything Agnes loathes: extreme privilege, popularity, and physical perfection (ok maybe she doesn't hate that part  so  much). Behind the scenes, though, Royce's flawless fa\u00e7ade fades away, revealing someone Agnes never expected\u2014someone who shows her that perhaps the best parts of life are the ones you  aren't  prepared for\u2014and as the competition heats up, so do things between these two rivals. But will the pressure to win be too much for them to handle\u2014or will Agnes (and Royce) get the last laugh?. "

England, 1388: All her life, Louisa has dreamed of finding the rumored \"Giant's Treasure,\" a collection of ancient, lost riches said to be hidden on a mountaintop in Scotland, guarded by a fierce monster. It's a story her father used to tell her, and when he dies and she and her younger sister have to go live with their shiftless, greedy uncle, Louisa is determined to find that treasure. It's the hope that has kept her defying her uncle's efforts to marry her off to the highest bidder.  After her uncle starts to parade Louisa's twelve-year-old sister Margaret in front of potential husbands, Louisa realizes she has no time to waste. She disguises herself as a boy and takes off for Scotland. But the road is a harsher place than she'd imagined, and she is relieved to find a friend in the knight, Sir Charles, who goes along with her on her journey.  Charles is intrigued by this young woman who claims her name is \"Jack\" and is set on going to Scotland. He goes along, pretending to believe she is a boy, in order to make sure nothing bad happens to her. As they meet new friends along the road, and as Louisa comes clean about her identity, the pair find themselves falling in love. But what will happen when they reach Scotland? Will they find their independence and the freedom to marry in the form of a buried treasure, or will the monster from Louisa's own past keep the young couple apart?

Zara loves love in all forms: 90s romcoms and romance novels and grand sweeping gestures. And she's desperate to have her own great love story. Crucially, a  real  one. So when her best friend Adnan begs her to pretend to date him to cover up his new top-secret relationship, Zara is hesitant. This isn't the kind of thing she had in mind. But there's something in it for Zara too: making her parents, who love Adnan, happy might just stop them arguing for a while. She may not be getting her own love story, but she could save theirs.  So Zara agrees and the act begins: after all, how different can pretending to be in a relationship with your best friend be to just hanging around with them like usual? Turns out, a lot. With fake dating comes fake hand-holding and fake kissing and  real  feelings... And when a new boy turns up in Zara's life, things get more confusing than ever. The course of true love never did run smooth, but Zara's love story is messier than most...   A hilarious and heartfelt romcom, told with a light touch, perfect for fans of TO ALL THE BOYS I'VE LOVED BEFORE, EXCUSE ME WHILE I UGLY CRY and HANI AND ISHU'S GUIDE TO FAKE DATING. "

One classic fairy tale. Absolutely no cell service. Stella Griffin doesn't believe in fairy tales. Ever since her boyfriend dumped her three weeks before the prom- not  ideal timing-she's convinced every love story is a lie. She's ready to skip the prom entirely. But she and her best friend, Nisha, have been planning for years to celebrate at Disneyland before the prom . . . an OG OC tradition. But even being all dressed up at the Happiest Place on Earth isn't salvaging Stella's night. Nisha has brought along her friend Reece to join them, and he and Stella do  not  get along. They're like oil and water. Cats and dogs. Aladdin and Jafar. And so what if Reece is, fine, kind of cute? Stella's over it all. Happily-ever-afters, true love's kisses, princes on white horses. It's not real. . . . Or is it? Because when Stella and Reece push through a hidden door in Sleeping Beauty's castle, they're not in Anaheim anymore. They're  in  the story. In  Sleeping Beauty -with Aurora and Phillip, the fairies, Maleficent, and extremely intelligent woodland creatures. Unfortunately, they've landed right in the  middle  of the story-which throws things off. Suddenly, Aurora and Phillip are meeting before they were supposed to. The fairies are suspicious of the interlopers, and even Maleficent gets word of their arrival. Stella and Reece will have to put aside their differences, make sure Aurora and Phillip fall in love, and get the story back on track-because if things don't end the way they're supposed to . . . they might never get home. Will they be able to pull off a fairy-tale ending? And will Stella and Reece get a happily-ever-after of their own?. "

The only thing keeping nineteen-year-old Case Michaels together after the death of his best friend, Walker, is a list Walker left behind of things he wants Case to accomplish in his absence. So far, though, Case hasn't even been able to continue riding bulls in the rodeo circuit, something he's done his entire life, balking at the thought of competing without Walker by his side. But the list? Case is determined to follow it to the letter\u2013 and he follows it all the way to Winnie Sutton. Eighteen-year-old Winnie Sutton just wants to keep her family together. She graduated high school early to work long shifts at the Michaels family ranch so she can support her younger siblings and a father who's more than happy to let Winnie fill the responsible parent role. If she sometimes sneaks out to ride the horses herself and forget about life for a while\u2013 well, that's no one else's business\u2013 until the day she crashes headfirst into Case Michaels. Case sees her riding skills and immediately ropes her into competing for the ranch  and  becoming his friend. Winnie and Case couldn't be more different, but Case can't help but be inspired by Winnie's badly-hidden passion for riding and competition. And there's something about Case that makes Winnie want to try grasping onto a dream for herself, whether that's a shot at a rodeo trophy, the annoyingly handsome rancher's son who won't leave her alone, or maybe both.

When seventeen-year-old Bailey starts a new job at a hotel waterpark, she is less than thrilled to see an old acquaintance is one of her coworkers. Bailey met Charlie a year ago on the long flight to Omaha, where she moved after her parents' divorce. Charlie's cynicism didn't mix well with Bailey's carefully well-behaved temperament, and his endless commentary was the irritating cherry on top of an already emotionally fraught trip.   Now, Bailey and Charlie are still polar opposites, but instead of everything about him rubbing Bailey the wrong way, she starts to look forward to hanging out and gossiping about the waterpark guests and their coworkers\u2014particularly two who keep flirting with each other. Bailey and Charlie make a bet on whether or not the cozy pair will actually get together. Charlie insists that members of the opposite sex can't just be friends, and Bailey is determined to prove him wrong.    Bailey and Charlie keep close track of the romantic progress of others while Charlie works to deflect the growing feelings he's developed for Bailey. Terrified to lose her if his crush becomes known, what doesn't help his agenda is Bailey and Charlie \"fake dating\" in order to disrupt the annoying pleasantries between Bailey's mom and her mom's new boyfriend. Soon, what Charlie was hoping to avoid becomes a reality as Bailey starts to see him as not only a friend she can rely on in the midst of family drama\u2014but someone who makes her hands shake and heart race. But Charlie has a secret\u2014a secret that involves Bailey and another bet Charlie may have made. Can the two make a real go of things...or has Charlie's secret doomed them before they could start?.

                "In this lush and terrifying debut\u2014perfect for readers of The Hunger Games and Children of Blood and Bone\u2014Camila Victoire creates a future where cruelty and spectacle hold the keys to subjugating humans on a ravaged earth.  At the end of the twenty-first century, climate change and famine almost ended humanity\u2014until the discovery of the Klujns, a barbaric, humanoid species with strangely colored eyes and even stranger abilities. Their crystal claws and bones fertilize barren soil, and their tender meat is a super-protein. Klujns are both humans' saviors and natural-born enemies, meant to be hunted and used.  When sixteen-year-old Ava finds herself on the wrong side of a military fence erected to protect the North American Territory, she's captured by Klujns and made to participate in the Blood Race, a macabre tradition where young human hostages compete to the death for Klujn amusement. At first, she is terrified, but as Ava observes Klujn behavior that contradicts what she's learned, she begins to wonder: Are Klujns as different as she was led to believe? And, as she fights for her life, does it matter?  Inspired by four years on the road with a traveling circus, where the word itself embodies an entire culture built on dark spectacle, Camila Victoire delivers a twisted coming-of-age tale that combines elements of fantasy, magical realism, and suspense. Blood Circus will capture fans of Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games and Tomi Adeyemi's Children of Blood and Bone. Its masterful worldbuilding, plot twists, and boundary-pushing Blood Race are wholly immersive\u2014and compel readers to call their own long-held assumptions, values, and belief systems into question.

                "From the #1  New York Times  bestselling author Brandon Sanderson comes the final book in an epic series about a girl who will travel beyond the stars to save the world she loves from destruction.  Spensa made it out of the Nowhere, but what she saw in the space between the stars has changed her forever. She came face to face with the Delvers, and finally got answers to the questions she's had about her own strange Cytonic gifts.\u00a0 The Superiority didn't stop in it's fight for galactic dominance while she was gone, though. Spensa's team, Skyward Flight, was able to hold Winzik off, and even collect allies to help with the cause, but it's only a matter of time until humanity\u2014and the rest of the galaxy\u2014falls.\u00a0 Defeating them will require all the knowledge Spensa gathered while in the Nowhere. But being Cytonic is more complicated than she ever could have imagined. Now, Spensa must ask herself: how far is she willing to go for victory, if it means losing herself\u2014and her friends\u2014in the process. "

At first, Nicolette's world seems more or less the same despite the occupation. But as the months pass, the Third Reich tightens its hold on France and it becomes clear just what is at stake.    Nicolette is drawn into a growing resistance movement, determined to do her part to fight back. It's a deadly secret she'll have to keep from everyone, including her family. Nicolette's own father works for local law enforcement, which is now under Nazi control, and who knows what might happen if anyone found out she joined the Resistance. But as Hitler's empire grows, no one can escape the horrors of war. Including Nicolette.    One night, she vanishes without a trace, taken from the street by Nazi soldiers and declared an enemy of the state. Soon, Nicolette finds herself confronting the very heart of Hitler's plans, bearing witness not just to the atrocities, but also to the courage, bravery, and hope that can emerge in even the darkest times. And it is in these small but powerful moments that Nicolette realizes her greatest weapon against the Nazis: to live, so she can tell the world the truth of what happened. But can one girl survive what was designed to destroy so many?. "
