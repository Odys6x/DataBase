                "Just as South Bay High\u2019s Jayd Jackson is feeling good that her two main social circles have finally come together, drama takes over once more, and the usual suspects are involved...    These days, family and relationship drama is the name of the game in Jayd\u2019s life\u2014from her fighting uncles on the home front to her friend Mickey\u2019s possible pregnancy\u2014aka her \u201cmaybe baby\u201d\u2014to a vengeful plan being plotted by Misty, Jayd\u2019s nemesis, over a highly personal problem. In fact, Jayd may have to do some plotting of her own to keep her crew safe from Misty\u2019s drama. Meanwhile, Rah is trying to get closer to Jayd, but she won\u2019t be his rebound girl. Everything comes to a head when Jayd\u2019s ex, Jeremy, asks to play basketball with Rah and the others and is told that a white boy can\u2019t ball. Jeremy proves them wrong, but will that be enough for them to let him on the team for an important game? Or will ego and stereotyping win? It\u2019s almost more than Jayd can take\u2014until her Mama reminds her of her powerful lineage. Now it\u2019s time for Jayd to catch up on her spirit work, and confront some powerful emotions of her own\u2026. "

The discourse on public space as understood in the democratic-rationalist tradition, when applied to the Singaporean public space, would offer much criticism but would not be adequate in identifying alternative processes that allow for transformative potentials in public space. Thus said, the objectives of this book are: 1. To develop a conceptual frame of reference to construct the discourse on Singapore public space 2. To form a preliminary model of Singapore public space through analyzing case studies 3. To understand the modes, methods of production and representation of these public spaces within the rapidly changing urban context 4. To situate these constructions of public space and its possible trajectories within the larger discourse on public space, and to examine the viability of such a construction and interpretive model of public space.

Singapore and Seoul are known for their rapid economic growth and urbanisation under a strong control of developmental state in the past. However, these cities are at a critical crossroads of societal transformation, where participatory and community-based urban development is gaining importance. This new approach can be seen as a result of a changing relationship between the state and civil society, where an emerging partnership between both aims to overcome the limitations of earlier urban development. The book draws attention to the possibilities and challenges that these cities face while moving towards a more inclusive and socially sustainable post-developmental urbanisation. By applying a comparative perspective to understand the evolving urban paradigms in Singapore and Seoul, this unique and timely book offers insights for scholars, professionals and students interested in contemporary Asian urbanisation and its future trajectories.

                "\"In the 1920s and 1930s, the port cities of Southeast Asia were staging grounds for diverse groups of ordinary citizens to experiment with modernity, as a rising Japan and the growth of American capitalism challenged the predominance of European empires after the First World War. Both migrants and locals played a pivotal role in shaping civic culture. Moving away from a nationalist reading of the period, Su Lin Lewis explores layers of cross-cultural interaction in various spheres: the urban built environment, civic associations, print media, education, and popular culture. While the book focuses on Penang, Rangoon, and Bangkok - three cities born amidst British expansion in the region - it explores connected experiences across Asia and in Asian intellectual enclaves in Europe. Cosmopolitan sensibilities were severely tested in the era of post-colonial nationalism, but are undergoing a resurgence in Southeast Asia's civil society and creative class today\"-- Provided by publisher.

In the inner city of major metropolitan centers, municipal governments battle high-ranking state agencies to secure land rents from redevelopment projects, while residents mobilize to assert property and residential rights. At theurban edge, as metropolitan governments seek to extend control over their rural hinterland through massive-scale development. "

A key question is whether the planning approaches, which have served Singapore so well until now, will suffice to meet the emerging challenges of a changing global economy, demographic shifts, new technologies and the existential threat of climate change. Singapore as a global city is becoming more unequal and more diverse. This has the potential to weaken the social compact which has largely existed since independence and to undermine the social resilience undoubtedly needed to cope with the shocks and disruptions of the twenty-first century. The book concludes, however, that Singapore is better-placed than most to respond to the challenges which it will certainly face\"-- Provided by publisher. "

Specific case studies include New Orleans in the context of a fragile environment, a framework to include poverty aspects in the cities and climate change discussion, a contribution to measure the impact of cities and their GHG emissions. Cities and Climate Change is the first title in the World Bank's new Urban Development Series. The Series discusses the challenge of urbanization and what it will mean for developing countries in the decades ahead, and aims to delve more substantively into the core issues framed by the World Bank's 2009 Urban Strategy, Systems of Cities: Harnessing Urbanization for Growth and Poverty Alleviation.

                "\"Visitors to Thailand's urban and beach-sided tourist hotspots notice the presence of colourful and predominantly female vendors offering self-made and mass-manufactured products. A high percentage of these vendors are members of the highland ethnic minority group of Akha who have become micro-entrepreneurs or self-employed street vendors. The work and everyday life experiences of these ethnic minority migrants are situated at the intersections of tourism, migration, and the informal sector. This book investigates the social, economic, and political embeddedness of street vendors in urban tourist contexts in Thailand. Based on extensive field research, it presents a detailed analysis of urban-directed mobility patterns and revealing strategies and dilemmas in the urban souvenir business. Focusing on the development of urban ethnic minority souvenir stalls run mostly by people belonging to the group of 'hilltribes', the author explains the spatial expansion of ethnic businesses and assesses the economic and political obstacles micro-entrepreneurs are confronted with. The book offers an understanding of the everyday practices and social relations of and between unequally powerful actors related to ethnic minority tourism in urban contexts, and systematically integrates individual and collective action into socio-economic and politico-institutional contexts\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "\"How can people live together, with ever more diverse characteristics, in the world's rapidly expanding cities? The UN estimates a doubling of the world's urban population by 2050. Meanwhile, global migration flows show profound diversification of migrants' nationality, ethnicity, language, gender balance, age, human capital and legal status. Everywhere, migrants with complex 'new diversity' traits dwell in cities alongside people from previous, 'old diversity' waves. That is, since new migrants tend to inhabit those urban spaces which still play host to migrants from previous waves, these new patterns of diversification are 'layered' on top of pre-existing patterns of diversity. How do prior conditions of diversity affect the incorporation of new migrants who are characterized by significantly different traits? With these issues in mind, this book address the core research question: In public spaces compared across cities, what accounts for similarities and differences in social and spatial patterns that arise under conditions of diversification, when new diversity-meets-old diversity? Based on a five-year comparative research project carried out by a multi-disciplinary team, Diversities Old and New provides findings from New York (a classic city of immigration, with new global migrant flows in a broadly supportive political context), Singapore (dominated by racial-cultural politics, and wholly dependent on new, highly restricted migrants), and Johannesburg (emerging from Apartheid with tensions around unregulated new, pan-African migrant flows). Spanning sociology, anthropology and human geography, the book seeks to analyze the changing nature of diversity and it's socio-spatial patterns in major cities around the world. In addition to rich ethnographic descriptions and robust sociological examination concerning some of the key urban processes of our age, Diversities Old And New also provides methodological innovations, including visual methods, which have been utilized to gather and analyze data. More information on these innovations can be found using the QR code below\"-- Provided by publisher. "

                "\"'The data economy' is a term used by many, but properly understood by few. Even more so the concept of 'big data'. Both terms embody the notion of a digital world in which many transactions and data flows animate a virtual space. This is the unseen world in which technology has become the master, with the hand of the human less visible. In fact, however, it is human interaction in and around technology that makes data so pervasive and important - the ability of the human mind to extract, manipulate and shape data that gives meaning to it. This book outlines the findings and conclusions of a multi-disciplinary team of data scientists, lawyers and economists tasked with studying both the possibilities of exploiting the rich datasets made available from many human-technology interactions, and the practical and legal limitations in trying to do so. It revolves around a core case study of Singapore's public transport system, using data both from the private company operating the contactless payment system (EZ-Link) and the government agency responsible for public transport infrastructure (LTA). In analysing both the possibilities and the limitations of these datasets, the authors propose policy recommendations both in-terms of uses for large datasets and the legislation necessary to enable these uses while protecting the privacy of users\"-- Provided by publisher.

This study, written by expert authors from within the region, outlines the challenges of urban sustainability, liveability and economic growth that Southeast Asia faces in the 21st century.

In Laos, after the Lao version of perestroika, Chintanakaan Mai, in 1986, for better or worse, rural development and urbanization have progressed, and people's livelihoods are about to change significantly. Compared to those of the neighboring countries of mainland Southeast Asia, however, many traditional livelihoods such as region-specific/ethnic-specific livelihood complexes, which combined traditional rice farming with a variety of subsistence activities, have been carried over into the present in Laos. The biggest challenge this book presents is to elucidate livelihood strategies of people who cope successfully with both social and environmental changes and to illustrate how to maintain this rich social and natural environment of Laos in the future. The book includes chapters on social, cultural, and natural concerns and on ethnicity, urbanization, and regional development in Laos. All chapters are based on original data from field surveys. These data will greatly contribute not only to local studies in Laos but also to environmental studies in developing countries. "

By creating opportunities and setting incentives for firms to invest and productively employ inputs, the investment climate is critical to economic growth and prosperity. Analyzing and comparing the investment climate of Brazil, India, and South Africa, three of today's largest emerging economies, this book presents policy makers with the scope of investment climate reforms in these countries. Inter- and intra-country benchmarking can be a starting point for dialogue between the government and private sector on reform priorities and help to encourage the sharing of best practices. Our hope is that this book will encourage and facilitate reform steps that can improve the investment climate in emerging economies.\"--Jacket. "

Over the next 10-15 years, it is expected to rise to well over 50%, adding an additional 200 million mainly rural migrants to the current urban population of 560 million. How China copes with such a large migration flow will strongly influence rural-urban inequality, the pace at which urban centers expand their economic performance, and the urban environment. The growing population will necessitate a big push strategy to maintain a high rate. "
