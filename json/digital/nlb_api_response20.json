It examines how the rapidly developing technology revolution is changing the way business must operate in this unfolding 21st century. It also considers the impact on people and how our daily lives and life styles will change\u2075for ever. In particular there\u2082s a blueprint and roadmap showing how companies can navigate their way through the rapidly changing environment and still emerge as winners. Everything we are used to is changing. Our computer world of point and click is morphing into Think, Talk and Move, where just thought, voice and simple remote gestures will control 3D holographic displays of data, content and video. Companies will need to reinvent themselves as MCEs, 'multi-channel enterprises', in which there is seamless cross-channel interaction with customers and they will also need to change the way their operating systems and processes are organized. The shift of consumer spend to online will see traditional retailing under threat as high street bricks \u2082n mortar economics are undermined. Expect massive changes among retailers and also the commercial property companies as they restructure their portfolios. New advances in the Cloud will cut costs and time to market and challenge decades of IT infrastructure. Technology generally is now becoming the key source of enablement and competitive advantage. "

Whilst it assumes a modest familiarity with computers, its aim is to provide a guide to the issues suitable for undergraduates. In doing so, the author prompts the students to consider questions such as: - How do morality and the law relate to each other? - What sould be covered in a professional Code of Conduct for Information Technology professionals? - What are the ethical issues relating to copying software? - Is electronic monitoring of employees wrong? - What are the moral codes of cyberspace? Throughout, the book shows how in many ways the technological development is outpacing the ability of our legal systems to keep up, and how different paradigms applied to ethical questions may often offer conflicting conclusions. As a result students will find this to be a thought-provoking and valuable survey of the new and difficult ethical questions that the Internet, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality have created.

Whilst it assumes a modest familiarity with computers, its aim is to provide a guide to the issues suitable for undergraduates. In doing so, the author prompts the students to consider questions such as: - How do morality and the law relate to each other? - What sould be covered in a professional Code of Conduct for Information Technology professionals? - What are the ethical issues relating to copying software? - Is electronic monitoring of employees wrong? - What are the moral codes of cyberspace? Throughout, the book shows how in many ways the technological development is outpacing the ability of our legal systems to keep up, and how different paradigms applied to ethical questions may often offer conflicting conclusions. As a result students will find this to be a thought-provoking and valuable survey of the new and difficult ethical questions that the Internet, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality have created.

                "This book explores the new terrain of network capitalism through the transformations of the discourse on technology. Rather than viewing such discourse as either a true or false reflection of reality, Fisher evaluates the ideological role that technology discourse plays in the legitimation of a new form of capitalism. Based on an extensive empirical analysis, the book argues that contemporary technology discourse at one and the same time promises more personal empowerment through network technology and legitimates a more privatized, flexible, and precarious economic constellations. Such discourse signals a new tradeoff in the political culture of capitalism, from a legitimation discourse which emphasizes the capacity of technology and technique to bring about social emancipation (through equality, stability, and security) to a legitimation discourse which focuses on the capacity of technology to bring about individual emancipation (through individual empowerment, authenticity, creativity, and cooperation). Contrary to the prevailing assumption that sees network technology as liberating from the rigidity and pitfalls of a stifling, Fordist capitalism, the book offers a theoretical framework which sees contemporary technology discourse as an ideology that legitimates the economic, social, and political arrangements of the new capitalism.

                "\"Without venture capital, many of the companies whose technical innovations sparked the digital revolution would not exist. Venture investments funded these firms to develop their bright ideas into commercial products that created new business models and established whole new markets. In Profiting from Innovation, Henry Kressel, a partner at multi-billion-dollar global investing company Warburg Pincus, takes you behind the scenes of the private equity process. He draws on his extensive experience to show how venture capital works, why venture capitalists fund certain companies and not others, and what factors influence the success or failure of their high-risk, high-reward investments. He also discusses venture capital's future, now that the commercialization of technology requires larger investments and global market access. Written in clear, non-technical language, the book features informative case studies of venture capital funding in a wide range of industries, including telecommunications, software and services, semiconductors, and the internet\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "This book explores the new terrain of network capitalism through the transformations of the discourse on technology. Rather than viewing such discourse as either a true or false reflection of reality, Fisher evaluates the ideological role that technology discourse plays in the legitimation of a new form of capitalism. Based on an extensive empirical analysis, the book argues that contemporary technology discourse at one and the same time promises more personal empowerment through network technology and legitimates a more privatized, flexible, and precarious economic constellations. Such discourse signals a new tradeoff in the political culture of capitalism, from a legitimation discourse which emphasizes the capacity of technology and technique to bring about social emancipation (through equality, stability, and security) to a legitimation discourse which focuses on the capacity of technology to bring about individual emancipation (through individual empowerment, authenticity, creativity, and cooperation). Contrary to the prevailing assumption that sees network technology as liberating from the rigidity and pitfalls of a stifling, Fordist capitalism, the book offers a theoretical framework which sees contemporary technology discourse as an ideology that legitimates the economic, social, and political arrangements of the new capitalism.

                "The personal computer age had been upon us just a few years when a new development changed everything: the Internet. Now people around the world could use their computers to link up with one another as well as with libraries, businesses, and schools - virtually any individual or place that had a computer. The new information revolution had begun, and, along with it, a host of social issues from cyberporn to educational access.

Drawing on three years of multimillion-dollar research into hundreds of b-webs as diverse as the Microsoft Alliance and the automotive industry, the authors illuminate the five distinct types of b-web now in play: Agoras, Aggregations, Value Chains, Alliances, Distributive Networks. Punctuating their analysis with a rich set of case studies, they provide the definitive guide to business-model innovation in the digital economy.\" \"The authors warn that participation in b-webs is not optional. To encounter and satisfy the digital customer, firms must lead or partner in one or more of these new business networks. While no single path leads to b-web success, business will adopt effective b-web strategies - or they will simply fade away.\"--BOOK JACKET.

Our students are expected to be agents of change rather than passive observers of world events; and at the same time, to live together in an increasingly diverse and complex society and to reflect on and interpret fast changing information. In such a new world order, the holistic development of our students, namely in the cognitive, aesthetics, physical, social and moral, leadership and global domains, is pivotal. This edited book provides descriptive and interpretive accounts of how an elementary school in the FutureSchools@Singapore programme creates holistic technology-enhanced learning experiences for its students at the classroom and school levels. By documenting these accounts and linking them to student learning outcomes, the school will lead the way in providing possible models for the seamless and pervasive integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into the curriculum for the holistic development of our students.

The trouble is, says futurist Richard Watson, such deep thinking cannot take place if we never really sit still or completely switch off from the connected world. In this absorbing new book, Watson argues that despite the advances of the digital age, it has also robbed us of some of our best ideas; to reg. "
