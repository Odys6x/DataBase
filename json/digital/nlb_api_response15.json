                "\"Autism has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years, thanks to dramatically increasing rates of diagnosis, extensive organizational mobilization, journalistic coverage, biomedical research, and clinical innovation. Understanding Autism, a social history of the expanding diagnostic category of this contested illness, takes a close look at the role of emotion--specifically, of parental love--in the intense and passionate work of biomedical communities investigating autism. Chloe Silverman tracks developments in autism theory and practice over the past half-century and shows how an understanding of autism has been constituted and stabilized through vital efforts of schools, gene banks, professional associations, government committees, parent networks, and treatment conferences. She examines the love and labor of parents, who play a role in developing--in conjunction with medical experts--new forms of treatment and therapy for their children. While biomedical knowledge is dispersed through an emotionally neutral, technical language that separates experts from laypeople, parental advocacy and activism call these distinctions into question. Silverman reveals how parental care has been a constant driver in the volatile field of autism research and treatment, and has served as an inspiration for scientific change\"--Provided by publisher.

In their own words, children and young people of a variety of ages talk openly and honestly about losing their mother or father. They describe feelings of pain, loss and anger, the struggle to cope with the embarrassed reactions and silence of others, and the difficulties involved in rebuilding their lives. They also share happy and loving memories of their parents, and talk about the importance of remembering while learning to accept their parent's death. The accounts cover a variety of circumstances in which a parent died, including death from cancer, heart attack and involvement in an accident. Taboo experiences which are often avoided about are also covered, including death through alcoholism, natural disaster, war, suicide, and domestic violence. The book displays a courageous and insightful group of children and young people who prove that it is possible to talk openly about these subjects without stigma. \"Still Here with Me\" will be a valuable source of information and comfort to young people who are struggling to cope with the loss of a parent.; It will also provide insights into the needs of grieving children for parents, teachers, social workers and other professionals.

As James grew up, his different perception of the world and the lack of understanding from NPs created problems. Together, he and his mother met the challenges with ingenuity and humour. One day, while taking a walk, James and Joan decided to write a book of their practical solutions. The Self-Help Guide for Special Kids is that book. Covering everything from eye sensitivity, to knowing how far away to stand from other people, to being polite when someone is crying, James and Joan's book describes the problems that an SP may face, and the solutions which they have found to work successfully. Pervaded by their caustic humour and common sense, The Self-Help Guide for Special Kids will be invaluable to other SPs and their families both as a source of advice and a fresh and witty account of how it feels to be an SP.

Because giftedness and disability often mask one another, many 2e kids aren't identified by our current mental health and educational systems--and as a result they don't receive the therapies or special educational services that can minimize their challenges and build on their talents. Despite their giftedness, 2e children often underachieve, drop out, and have poor life outcomes. Bright Not Broken offers parents and professionals proven alternatives for identifying and supporting 2e children. This revolutionary book will resonate with parents and teachers everywhere, showing that there is hope for bright children who have been misunderstood and misdiagnosed. Addresses fundamental problems in our current mental health and education systems and how these impact 2e children Offers hope for 2e children and shows how to develop their true potential Contributor Temple Grandin is an internationally known advocate for individuals with autism This important resource shows parents and educators how to help 2e children become capable adults\"--Provided by publisher.

                "In Race in the Making Lawrence Hirschfeld provides a new understanding of how people conceptualize social categories and shows why this knowledge is so readily recruited to create and maintain systems of unequal power. Hirschfeld argues that knowledge of race is not derived from observations of physical difference, nor does it develop in the same way as knowledge of other social categories. Instead, his central claim is that racial thinking is the product of a special-purpose cognitive competence for understanding and representing human kinds. By demonstrating that a common set of abstract principles underlies all systems of racial thinking, whatever other historical and cultural specificities may be associated with them, he challenges the conventional notion that race is purely a social construction. After surveying the literature on the development of a cultural psychology of race. Hirschfeld presents original studies that examine children's (and occasionally adults') representations of race. He sketches how a jointly cultural and psychological approach to race might proceed, showing how this approach yields new insights into the emergence and the elaboration of racial thinking. "

It is widely acknowledged that students from Singapore do well in mathematics in international studies. This book provides readers with a glimpse of students from Singapore who are at the other end of the ability spectrum. The book is based on a study that explored the mathematics content knowledge of Primary 4 low attainers in mathematics, their behaviours, affects and home backgrounds, and learning experiences. Based on the findings of the study, the book has recommendations for teachers of low attainers in primary mathematics. This book serves as a must-have resource for teachers and graduate students in Singapore who are working with or studying low attainers in primary mathematics. It also makes a worthy contribution towards literature on low attainers in the field of mathematics education. "

                "Annotation Why, after a childhood of emotional neglect and abuse, would a man move next door to the very parents who caused him pain? And how can a woman emerge from her mother's control in order to form healthy adult relationships?Giving up family attachments that failed to meet our needs as children, David Celani argues, is the hardest psychological task an adult can undertake. Yet the reality is that many adults re-create the most painful aspects of their early relationships with their parents in new relationships with peers and romantic partners, frustrating themselves and discouraging them from leaving their family of origin. Leaving Home emphasizes the life-saving benefits of separating from destructive parents and offers a viable program for personal emancipation.Celani's program is based on Object-Relations Theory, a branch of psychoanalysis developed by Scottish analyst Ronald Fairbairn. The human personality, Fairbairn argued, is not the result of inherited (and thus immutable) instincts. Rather, the developing child builds internal relational templates that guide his future interactions with others based on the conscious and unconscious memories he internalized from his primary relationship -- the one he experienced with his parents. While a child's attachment to parents who were neglectful or even abusive is not uncommon, there is a way out. Articulate, sensitive, and replete with examples from Celani's twenty-six years of clinical practice, this book outlines the practical steps to leaving home. "

                "In Race in the Making Lawrence Hirschfeld provides a new understanding of how people conceptualize social categories and shows why this knowledge is so readily recruited to create and maintain systems of unequal power. Hirschfeld argues that knowledge of race is not derived from observations of physical difference, nor does it develop in the same way as knowledge of other social categories. Instead, his central claim is that racial thinking is the product of a special-purpose cognitive competence for understanding and representing human kinds. By demonstrating that a common set of abstract principles underlies all systems of racial thinking, whatever other historical and cultural specificities may be associated with them, he challenges the conventional notion that race is purely a social construction. After surveying the literature on the development of a cultural psychology of race. Hirschfeld presents original studies that examine children's (and occasionally adults') representations of race. He sketches how a jointly cultural and psychological approach to race might proceed, showing how this approach yields new insights into the emergence and the elaboration of racial thinking. "

It will give you an understanding of the integrated school library program as well as an appreciation of its benefits. After describing changes in the role of the teacher-librarian (or school library media specialist), the authors provide a rationale for creating an active partnership among teachers, librarians, and students. Innovative resource-based units of study for all elementary grades demonstrate how the partnership works in relation to author studies, literary themes, social studies, and science. All projects have been successfully classroom tested. This practical approach will appeal equally to teacher-librarians and classroom teachers. The book can also be used in introductory courses on school library programs and in courses on resource-based learning. "
