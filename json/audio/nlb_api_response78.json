                "One of the BBC's most anticipated books for 2024   'The story told here is instrumental to your own' - Jared Lanier    'Timely, erudite, important' - Ayad Akhtar   What happens when our cultural and artistic lives are dictated to us by an algorithm? What does it mean when shareability supersedes innovation? How can we make a choice when the options have been so carefully arranged for us?  From coffee shops to city grids to TikTok feeds and Netflix homepages the world over, algorithmic recommendations prescribe our experiences. This network of mathematically determined choices - the 'Filterworld' - has taken over, almost unnoticed, as we've grown accustomed to an insipid new normal. But to have our tastes, behaviours, and emotions governed by computers calls the very notion of free will into question.   Internationally recognized journalist and  New Yorker  staff writer Kyle Chayka journeys through this ever-tightening web woven by algorithms. He explores how online and offline spaces alike have been engineered for seamless consumption. How the lowest common denominator is promoted at the expense of the complex, diverse or challenging. How users of technology contend with data-driven equations that promise to anticipate their desires but often get them wrong. How the FIlterworld is determining the very shape of culture itself.  Chayka skilfully and compellingly traces this creeping, machine-guided curation that influences not just what culture we consume, but what culture is produced. In doing so, he attempts to answer to the most urgent question currently facing us: is personal freedom ever again possible on the Internet?  Filterworld  is a fascinating history of the rise of the algorithm and an important investigation into where it could take us next - if we let it. "

With over 2,000 locations across the UK and overseeing multiple operations daily for the past two decades, it's fair to say that the CEO of the family-owned Timpson business knows a thing or two about running a successful company. What makes James Timpson's approach to collaboration, profit and success is simple: let the people you hire run your business. That might seem like a simple concept to a CEO, manager or director but if you think about the hundreds of meetings, hours lost from your day by responding to emails, signing off on projects and more, you will notice that you are still working in a traditional, top-down mindset. Doing this means the team you work with only see themselves as a cog in the machine instead of the trusted, valued colleagues that they are. The Happy Index is structured into lessons that will equip you and the people you work with, with the tools and tactics to re-evaluate the ways you manage your business. Offering insight into the ways in which James has overseen the family business, he firmly believes that you will see the benefits of working with an upside-down mindset, not only for financial success but also your team's wellbeing and happiness. Really, though, it's easy. Turn up on time. Trust your team. Do your work. "

Now, bestselling author of  The Second Machine Age , Andrew McAfee, explains how engineers and geeks are changing the world of business \u2013 with extraordinary results. A new model is being pioneered by geeks; a radical new mindset that has shifted the paradigm entirely on what a business can \u2013 and should \u2013 be. They do not follow the rules of the Industrial era, with their hierarchies and bureaucratic ways of thinking. They do not follow the principles preached in business schools since the dawn of time. They have all dedicated themselves to approaching business as a geek would: through trial and error, egalitarianism, evidence and stress-testing ideas in a group setting \u2013 rather than relying on the boss's instincts. By investigating and surveying the contemporary research in psychology, economics and the behavioural sciences, as well as first-hand accounts from the 'geek' leaders of today, McAfee's groundbreaking exploration of this emerging phenomenon gets to the heart of the tectonic shifts taking place all over the business world. We have entered a new age. And this age will transform how we achieve great things, now and into the future. The future is geek.

In  The Fund , Rob Copeland draws on hundreds of interviews with those inside and around the firm to reveal what really goes on with Dalio and his cohorts behind closed doors. Tracing more than fifty years of Dalio's leadership,  The Fund  peels back the curtain to reveal a rarefied world of wealth and power, where former FBI director Jim Comey kisses Dalio's ring, recent Pennsylvania Senate candidate David McCormick sells out, and countless Bridgewater acolytes describe what it's like to work at this fascinating firm. Dalio has stepped down from Bridgewater before; will the legacy of his Principles continue to chart the course of the firm?  The Fund  provides unique insight into the story of Dalio and Bridgewater, past, present and future.

While we see change as an exception and instability as something to overcome, change is actually an enduring principle of all our lives. Indeed, research shows that, on average, people experience thirty-six major 'disorder events' in the course of their adulthood. The mark of success is how we can flourish not by fighting but by embracing change.  Borrowing from the high-performance world of business, resilience-training and mindset-hacking, science and spirituality, philosophy and psychology, bestselling author and coach Brad Stulberg equips the reader with 'rugged flexibility' - a revelatory new framework to help overcome the challenge of change. When we start to implement rugged flexibility, we learn to view change as ongoing cycle of order, disorder, and reorder, and we become adept at thriving in the midst of flux.  The result of becoming a master of change is to be less stressed, less anxious and more confident, to experience sustained performance at work and beyond, and be happier and more fulfilled in life. "

Pink     Misinformation affects us daily, from social media to politics and even personal relationships. Policing social media alone cannot solve the complex problem shaped by partisan politics and subjective interpretations of truth. In  Misbelief  social scientist Dan Ariely explores the behaviour of 'misbelief' that leads people to distrust accepted truths and embrace conspiracy theories. Misinformation taps into something innate in all of us, regardless of political affiliation. By understanding this psychology, we can mitigate its effects. Grounded in research and Ariely's personal experience as a target of disinformation, the book analyses the psychological drivers behind adopting irrational beliefs. Ariely reveals the emotional, cognitive, personality, and social elements that drive people towards false information and mistrust. Despite advanced AI generating convincing fake news, Ariely offers hope. Awareness of the forces fuelling misbelief makes individuals and society more resilient. Combating misbelief requires empathy, not conflict. Recognising misbelief as a human problem allows us to be part of the solution. "

Flutter Entertainment, the parent company of Paddy Power, is the largest gambling business in the world. The evidence of that success is visible everywhere, from shop fronts and bus shelters to sporting arenas and smartphone screens. The company's rise to this point has been rapid, but like any gambler worth their salt, Paddy Power has always succeeded in finding an edge. At the outset those innovations were modest, like offering odds on television shows and giving punters money back on losing bets, but as the company's ambition grew, so too did its determination to stay one step ahead of the competition, whatever the cost... Impeccably researched and informed by dozens of insider interviews, Punters is the incredible story of how an unlikely band of misfits and visionaries bet on the future of the gambling industry and won big. But it's also the story of how that victory may have come at an extraordinary cost \u2013 to their customers and society at large. "

                "From\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's Tripp Mickle, the dramatic, untold story inside Apple after the passing of Steve Jobs by following his top lieutenants\u2014Jony Ive, the Chief Design Officer, and Tim Cook, the COO-turned-CEO\u2014and how the fading of the former and the rise of the latter led to Apple losing its soul. Steve Jobs called Jony Ive his \"spiritual partner at Apple.\" The London-born genius was the second-most powerful person at Apple and the creative force who most embodies Jobs's spirit, the man who designed the products adopted by hundreds of millions the world over: the iPod, iPad, MacBook Air, the iMac G3, and the iPhone. In the wake of his close collaborator's death, the chief designer wrestled with grief and initially threw himself into his work designing the new Apple headquarters and the Watch before losing his motivation in a company increasingly devoted more to margins than to inspiration. In many ways, Cook was Ive's opposite. The product of a small Alabama town, he had risen through the ranks from the supply side of the company. His gift was not the creation of new products. Instead, he had invented countless ways to maximize a margin, squeezing some suppliers, persuading others to build factories the size of cities to churn out more units. He considered inventory evil. He knew how to make subordinates sweat with withering questions. Jobs selected Cook as his successor, and Cook oversaw a period of tremendous revenue growth that has lifted Apple's valuation to $3 trillion. He built a commanding business in China and rapidly distinguished himself as a master politician who could forge global alliances and send the world's stock market into freefall with a single sentence. Author Tripp Mickle spoke with more than 200 current and former Apple executives, as well as figures key to this period of Apple's history, including Trump administration officials and fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour while writing After Steve. His research shows the company's success came at a cost. Apple lost its innovative spirit and has not designed a new category of device in years. Ive's departure in 2019 marked a culmination in Apple's shift from a company of innovation to one of operational excellence, and the price is a company that has lost its soul. "

The climb from individual contributor to manager is worth planning and preparing for, because this role is not only among the toughest on the organizational chart, but it is also the one that offers the most upside (and downside), both personally and for the organization. Making the Climb by Peter Oliver is the must-have playbook for anyone making the transition from salesperson to sales manager: - Allows managers and leaders to identify the mindsets, key behaviors, and skills needed to achieve success. - Provides strategies for overcoming the three most common pitfalls emerging sales managers face, to a successful move from salesperson to sales manager. - Outlines a proven action plan for emerging sales managers and their mentors. - Helps salespeople emerge on purpose into the next phase of their career-and become true sales leaders.

                "From Victoria Glendinning, winner of the Duff Cooper Prize, the James Tait Black Prize and (twice) the Whitbread Prize for Biography. 'It's\u00a0Succession\u00a0in tailcoats and spats ... This is a vivid and eye-opening group biography, backgrounded by the rise of supermarket moguls from humble beginnings' Sunday Times Who was John Lewis? What story lies behind the retail empire that bears his name? Behind the glass windows and displays of soft furnishing, this book reveals the family that founded the shops in all their eccentricities, and whose relationships became blighted by conflicts of epic proportions as their wealth bloomed. Born into poverty, John Lewis was orphaned at the age of seven when his father died in a Somerset workhouse. Dreaming of a better life, the young man travelled to London at the start of what would become a retail revolution. From early years as a draper's apprentice, we see how Lewis's first pokey little business opened on Oxford Street in 1864, and expanded as an emerging middle class embraced the department stores as a recreational experience. Prize-winning biographer Victoria Glendinning has had full access to the company and family archives to write this eye-opening story. She captures the toxic relationships that unfolded between Lewis and his two sons, Spedan and Oswald, as they collided over the future of their retail empire \u2013 their worst moments including emotional blackmail, face-slapping and a kidnapping \u2013 and much litigation between father and both sons. Yet the family never broke up and Spedan's vision of a Partnership model to act as an ethical corrective and foster a community of happier, more productive workers was eventually realised and survives to this day. With riveting personal detail, this brilliant group biography captures a rags-to-riches story and a tempestuous family saga, all unfolding against the dramatic social and political worlds of nineteenth-century London. The book concludes with an assessment of the position John Lewis holds in British sensibilities, and whether John Lewis and institutions like it have a place in our future. "

Mathematics is full of better ways of thinking, and with over 2,000 years of knowledge to draw on, Oxford mathematician Marcus du Sautoy interrogates his passion for shortcuts in this fresh and fascinating guide.\u00a0After all, shortcuts have\u00a0enabled so much of human progress,\u00a0whether in constructing the first cities around the Euphrates 5,000 years ago, using calculus to determine the scale of the universe or in writing today's algorithms that help us find a new life partner.\u00a0As well as looking at the most useful shortcuts in history\u00a0\u2013 such as measuring the circumference of the earth in 240 BC to diagrams that illustrate how modern GPS works \u2013 Marcus also looks at how you can use shortcuts in investing or how to learn a musical instrument to memory techniques. He talks to, among many, the writer Robert MacFarlane, cellist Natalie Clein and the psychologist Suzie Orbach, asking whether shortcuts are always the best idea and, if so, when they use them. With engaging puzzles and conundrums throughout to illustrate the shortcut's ability to find solutions with speed,\u00a0Thinking Better\u00a0offers many clever strategies for daily complex problems.

This is the essential handbook' CHRISTINE LAGARDE 'A remarkably good read'GILLIAN TETT, Financial Times 'This assault on the modern free market is a landmark achievement'WILL HUTTON, Observer What do you value? Why is it that often the things we value the most \u2013 from frontline nurses to the natural environment to keeping children well fed and educated \u2013 seem of little importance to economic markets? In Value(s), one of the great economic thinkers of our time examines how economic value and social values became blurred, how we went from living in a market economy to a market society, and how to rethink and rebuild before it's too late. The book will help arm the best in business, finance and government, and disarm the worst. During his time as a G7 central banker and seven years spent as Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney witnessed the collapse of public trust in elites, globalisation, and technology; the challenges of the 4th Industrial Revolution and the existential threat of the growing climate emergency. Drawing on a truly international perspective to our greatest problems, this book sets out a framework for the change needed for an economic and social renaissance in a post-Covid world. Embedding the values of sustainability, solidarity and responsibility into all decision-making is integral to his argument for how we can channel the dynamism of the market to turn intractable problems into enormous opportunities. His deeply researched and forward-looking manifesto goes to the heart of what we've got wrong in the past and offers action plans to set it right for individuals, businesses, investors and governments. In short, Value(s) sets out how we can build a better world for all. It is a book that offers achievable solutions to global problems, building a future fit for our children, grandchildren and generations to come. 'The ten pages where he takes down routine market fables are worth the price of the book alone.' writes Will Hutton. "

The rise of e-commerce. Big data. AI. Given these trends (and many others), there's no doubt that sales is changing. But much of the current conventional wisdom is misleading and not supported by empirical data. If you as a manager fail to separate fact from hype, you will make decisions based on faulty assumptions and, in a competitive market, eventually fall behind those with a keener grasp of the current selling environment. In this book, Cespedes provides sales managers and executives with the tools they need to separate the signal from the noise. These include how to: hire the right talent-not just stars; pay and properly incentivize your sales force; improve ROI from your training programs; create a comprehensive sales model that aligns with your strategy; set the right prices; and build and manage a multichannel approach. Chock-full of examples, research, guidelines, and diagnostics, Sales Management That Works is the book you need to build a great sales team, create an optimal strategy, and steer clear of hype and fads.

                "The dramatic inside story of the first four historic flights that launched SpaceX\u2014and Elon Musk\u2014from a shaky startup into the world's leading edge rocket company. In 2006, SpaceX\u2014a brand-new venture with fewer than 200 employees\u2014rolled its first, single-engine rocket onto a launch pad at Kwajalein Atoll. After a groundbreaking launch from the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Falcon 1 rocket designed by Elon Musk's engineers rose in the air for approximately thirty seconds. Then, its engine flamed out, and the rocket crashed back into the ocean. When he founded SpaceX, Elon Musk had only budgeted for three launches. After two more failed flight tests, and with only one Falcon 1 rocket left in its factory, SpaceX decided to try one last, dramatic launch. Over eight weeks, engineers worked furiously to prepare this final rocket. If it crashed and burned, so would SpaceX. In September 2008, SpaceX's last chance for success lifted off . . . and accelerated like a dream, soaring into orbit flawlessly. That success would launch a miraculous decade for the company, in which SpaceX grew from building a single-engine rocket to one with a staggering 27 engines; created two different spacecraft, and mastered reusable-rocket descents using mobile drone ships on the open seas. But these achievements would not have been possible without SpaceX's first four flight tests. Drawing on unparalleled access and exclusive interviews with dozens of former and current employees\u2014engineers, designers, mechanics, and executives, including Elon Musk\u2014Eric Berger tells the complete story of this foundational generation that transformed SpaceX into the world's leading space company.

                "From the bestselling author Simon Winchester, a human history of land around the world: who mapped it, owned it, stole it, cared for it, fought for it and gave it back. In 1889, thousands of hopeful people raced southward from the Kansas state line and westward from the Arkansas boundary to stake claims on the thousands of acres of unclaimed pastures and meadows. Across the twentieth century, water was dammed and drained in Holland so that a new province, Flevoland, rose up, unchartered and requiring new thinking. In 1850, California legislated the theft of land from Native Americans. An apology came in 2019 from the governor, but what of the call for reparations or return? What of government confiscation of land in India, or questions of fairness when it comes to New Zealand's Maori population and the legacy of settlers? The ownership of land has always been complicated, opaque, and more than a little anarchic when viewed from the outside. In this book, Simon Winchester explores the the stewardship of land, the ways it is delineated and changes hands, the great disputes, and the questions of restoration \u2013 particularly in the light of climate change and colonialist reparation. A global study, this is an exquisite exploration of what the ownership of land might really mean \u2013 not in dry-as-dust legal terms, but for the people who live on it. "

Sales performance can impact a company's revenue, profits, market share, and employee retention. The question is, how do you positively impact those goals? The answer is simple: sales improve when your team is better trained, coached, and supported. When a sales team is led the right way, there is an increased probability they will feel better about themselves, their jobs, stay longer, and become a future sales leader in the company. Many books focus on the symptoms of poor sales performance, but they don't tell you how to solve the problems. Next Level Sales Coaching gives you a proven, step-by-step, process and methodology on how to resolve the most common challenges you will face when leading your sales team. The strategies are built on the best practices of over 10,000 sales managers that we have interviewed, researched and observed in action over the last thirty-five years. This book covers how to connect with, train, coach and inspire your sales team. Ultimately, it will help you to reduce turnover, improve performance, and increase retention of top performers. "

                "DEFCON is the US military acronym for \"Defense Readiness Condition.\" DEFCON 1 is reserved only for imminent catastrophic events, like a nuclear war. Luckily, you don't have to fend off missile attacks in direct selling, but you will face some extremely difficult challenges and urgent crises leading your MLM team. It takes much more than a positive attitude and motivational words to be a successful field leader. True leadership requires you to deal with messy, complicated scenarios when there is not always a clear-cut solution. Many of these challenges are caused by factors completely out of your control-from economic, regulatory, and political setbacks, to having top leaders quit, to companies going out of business, and a host of other issues. It's at times like these, when it seems like your team is falling apart, that you must draw upon your resilience, persistence, and character to ride out the storm and lead your team through the chaos. This indispensable resource will enable you to: create a team culture of maximum readiness; deal with toxic leaders and effectively handle conflict resolution; use your leadership to make your team more powerful and build their self-esteem; handle corporate incompetence, poor decisions, and PR crises; and know what to do when you or a team leader leave a company.

                "Communicate effectively and create meaningful interactions in an increasingly digital world The rise of digital communications has led to three emergent, often problematic, forces: automation, the speed and volume of information transfer, and an unmet need for people to feel more than satisfied in their interpersonal transactions, particularly between seller and consumer. Following in the footsteps of their popular website and podcast, educators and entrepreneurs Dr. Reshan Richards and Stephen Valentine created  Make Yourself Clear  to address the challenges brought on by these rising trends. Through a mix of research, anecdotes, case studies, and theoretical speculation, this book equips readers to build understanding within their current and future audiences by leveraging the dispositions used by successful educators: authenticity, immediacy, and delight.  Make Yourself Clear  is not prescriptive, nor does it suggest rigid steps, pillars, or frameworks. Instead, it provides immediately recognizable and relatable context, suggesting actions that can be tried, measured, tested, and iterated upon in any communication context that involves the exchange of information and ideas. Ground your business communications in proven techniques Profit from expert instruction given by those who have helped thousands of readers and workshop students Develop your sales career by applying effective teaching practices to customer and colleague interactions For educators, adopt the latest best practices into your teaching style Backed by thorough research and extensive real-world testing,  Make Yourself Clear  opens a door to more productive communication and more effective interactions. It offers compelling and relevant insights to longtime fans and newcomers alike, leading to real and lasting benefits. "

Why be house poor when you can rent rich? \"Why rent when you can buy?\" More than any other, this phrase captures the overwhelmingly unanimous promotion of home ownership to Canadians. Real estate agents, mortgage brokers, family, friends, and even the government promote ownership as a safe, attractive, and sure-fire path to personal wealth. This one-size-fits-all advice ignores the reality of Canada's housing market. Canadians deserve better advice. Faced with expensive house prices in a near-zero interest rate world, it's time Canadians heard the virtues of renting and seriously considered renting as an alternative to home ownership. Real estate analyst Alex Avery insists renting offers a simple, more affordable way to live, plus in Canada's frenzied housing market, going month-to-month is dramatically lower risk. He claims the reputation of home ownership as a wealth building strategy is unfounded and shows renters how to replace bricks-and-mortar with better investment opportunities.

I loved it' Oliver Bullough, author of Moneyland For fans of Bad Blood and Flash Boys, the story of a trading prodigy who amassed $70 million from his childhood bedroom-until the US government accused him of helping trigger an unprecedented market collapse. On May 6, 2010, financial markets around the world tumbled simultaneously and without warning. In the span of five minutes, a trillion dollars of valuation was lost. The Flash Crash, as it became known, represented the fastest drop in market history. When share values rebounded less than half an hour later, experts around the globe were left perplexed. What had they just witnessed? Navinder Singh Sarao hardly seemed like a man who would shake the world's financial markets to their core. Raised in a working-class neighbourhood in West London, Nav was a preternaturally gifted trader who played the markets like a computer game. By the age of thirty, he had left behind London's trading arcades, working instead out of his childhood home. For years the money poured in. But when lightning-fast electronic traders infiltrated markets and started eating into his profits, Nav built a system of his own to fight back. It worked-until 2015, when the FBI arrived at his door. Depending on whom you ask, Sarao was a scourge, a symbol of a financial system run horribly amok, or a folk hero-an outsider who took on the tyranny of Wall Street and the high-frequency traders. A real-life financial thriller, Flash Crash uncovers the remarkable, behind-the-scenes narrative of a mystifying market crash, a globe-spanning investigation into international fraud, and the man at the centre of them both.

He walks you through the steps in the life of a business \u2014 from entrepreneurial infancy, through adolescent growing pains, to the mature entrepreneurial perspective, the guiding light of all businesses that succeed \u2014 and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Finally, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business. After you have listened to The E-Myth Revisited, you will truly be able to grow your business in a predictable and productive way. "

It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture \u2013 what they call \"the calm company\". It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive business, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn't just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn't more hours. Rather, it's less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. "

                "Legendary Silicon Valley visionary and one of the world's greatest business leaders, John Chambers shares the playbook and philosophy that transformed Cisco into a global tech titan and now inspire a new generation of leaders. With numerous start-ups moving from zero to a billion to bankruptcy in a matter of years, it's clear that sustaining a business in the digital age is no walk in the park. Over 20 years, John Chambers transformed a company with 400 employees and one toaster-sized product (a router) into a tech giant that's the backbone of the Internet. Along the way, he's outlasted and outmaneuvered practically every rival that ever tried to take Cisco on-Nortel, Lucent, Alcatel, IBM, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard, to name a few-and turned more than 10,000 employees into millionaires, more than any company in history. When Chambers stepped down as executive chairman in December of 2017, he left a company that didn't just shape the first Internet era but is leading the next wave of innovation in areas from cyber-security to self-driving cars. Now, in collaboration with award-winning journalist Diane Brady, Chambers shares the stories and strategies that helped his company win again and again through multiple market shifts. Posing a unique mode of thought proven to attain success, the message of this book is clear; it is not the biggest or the richest players who win, but the ones who are able to stay ahead of the trend by connecting the dots. Both enlightening and practical, this is essential reading to inspire a new generation of leaders. "

The times and circumstances in which people were raised often shape them \u2013 yet a few leaders have managed to shape their times. In this follow-up to the bestselling business classic The Hard Thing About Hard Things, Ben Horowitz turns his attention to a question crucial to every organisation: How do you create and sustain the culture you want? This book is a journey through cultures ancient to modern, spotlighting models of leadership and culture-building from the samurai to prison gangs. Along the way, it answers fundamental questions: Who are we? How do people talk about us when we're not around? How do we treat our customers? Can we be trusted? Because who you are is not the values you list on the wall. It's not what you say in a company-wide meeting. It's not your marketing campaign. It's not even what you believe. Who you are is what you do. This book will help you do the things needed to become the kind of leader you want to be \u2013 and others want to follow. "

                "What's the secret to sales success? If you're like most business leaders, you'd say it's fundamentally about relationships-and you'd be wrong. The best salespeople don't just build relationships with customers. They challenge them.   The need to understand what top-performing reps are doing that their average performing colleagues are not drove Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson, and their colleagues at Corporate Executive Board to investigate the skills, behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes that matter most for high performance. And what they discovered may be the biggest shock to conventional sales wisdom in decades.  Based on an exhaustive study of thousands of sales reps across multiple industries and geographies,  The Challenger Sale  argues that classic relationship building is a losing approach, especially when it comes to selling complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions. The authors' study found that every sales rep in the world falls into one of five distinct profiles, and while all of these types of reps can deliver average sales performance, only one-the Challenger- delivers consistently high performance.  Instead of bludgeoning customers with endless facts and features about their company and products, Challengers approach customers with unique insights about how they can save or make money. They tailor their sales message to the customer's specific needs and objectives. Rather than acquiescing to the customer's every demand or objection, they are assertive, pushing back when necessary and taking control of the sale.  The things that make Challengers unique are replicable and teachable to the average sales rep. Once you understand how to identify the Challengers in your organization, you can model their approach and embed it throughout your sales force. The authors explain how almost any average-performing rep, once equipped with the right tools, can successfully reframe customers' expectations and deliver a distinctive purchase experience that drives higher levels of customer loyalty and, ultimately, greater growth.

                "From the authors of the fascinating The Age of Cryptocurrency, comes the definitive work on the Internet's next big thing: the blockchain. Many of the 'legacy systems' once designed to make our lives easier and our economy more efficient are no longer up to the task; big banks have grown more entrenched, privacy exists only until the next hack, and credit card fraud has become a fact of life. However, there is a way past all this\u2015a new kind of operating system with the potential to revolutionise our economy: the blockchain. In The Truth Machine, Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna demystify the blockchain and explain why it can restore personal control over our data, assets, and identities; grant billions of excluded people access to the global economy; and shift the balance of power to revive society's faith in itself. They reveal the empowerment possible when self-interested middlemen give way to the transparency of the blockchain, while highlighting the job losses, assertion of special interests, and threat to social cohesion that will accompany this shift. With a balanced perspective, Casey and Vigna show why we all must care about the path that blockchain technology takes\u2015moving humanity forward, not backward. "

After all, how many companies can get their customers to tattoo their logo on their arms? After having worked with more than one thousand companies worldwide, Schmidt is ready to share the secrets that spurred Harley-Davidson's remarkable turnaround. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, Schmidt harnessed his passion for riding to create his famed Noise Cubed Trilogy\u2014the three questions he asks every one of his clients. They assess a company's positioning, competitiveness, and reputation, and are the key ingredients for any successful corporation: What do the customers your business served yesterday say about your business when they're talking about you to prospective customers? What do you want them to say? What are you doing to get them to say it? In Make Some Noise, Schmidt shares his full-throttle approach for businesses and individuals alike. Anyone looking to become more competitive and grow customer loyalty can learn from the case studies and experiences he shares. From a nondescript heavy construction company, to the most high-end \"luxury\" gas station in America, to Apple, and to his own personal landscaper, Schmidt illustrates how the answers to his trio of questions will yield a course of action to stand out in today's marketplace.

Most salespeople work in mature, overcrowded industries, your offerings perceived (often unfairly) as commodities. Growth requires taking market share from your competitors, while they try to do the same to you. How else can you grow 12 percent a year in an industry that's only growing by 3 percent?It's not easy for any salesperson to execute a competitive displacement\u2014or, in other words, \"eat their lunch.\" You might think this requires a bloodthirsty \"whatever it takes\" attitude, but that's the opposite of what works. If you act like a Mafia don, you only make yourself difficult to trust and impossible to see as a long-term partner. Instead, this book shows you how to find and maintain a long-term competitive advantage by taking steps like: * ranking prospective new clients not by their size or convenience to you, but by who stands to gain the most from your solution. * understanding the different priorities for everyone in your prospect's organization, from the CEO to the accountants, and addressing their various concerns. * developing a systematic contact plan for all those different stakeholders so you can win over the right people at the organization in the optimal sequence.Your competitors may be tough, but with the strategies you'll discover in this book, you'll soon be eating their lunch.

On his reality show Sell It Like Serhant, he uses his sales expertise to teach struggling salespeople to successfully sell everything from golf balls to hot tubs. In this book is the blueprint for how to go from sales scrub to sales machine. Serhant was a jobless hand model when he entered real estate. He outlines exactly how he flipped the switch and grew to dominate one of the most competitive sales markets in the world. Using personal accounts and lessons from his biggest (and smallest) deals, he gives fresh insight on how to manage multiple balls, or goals, at once to increase profits and achieve ultimate success. A salesman should not live or die by one deal or client. The ultimate salesperson never closes a deal and wonders, \"What now?\" because the next deal should already be happening. The Serhant principle is that it takes just as much time and energy to manage one deal as it does six. This book will help you learn how to bring in, control, and manage multiple balls successfully. A true salesperson knows it's a volume business. By juggling all your balls in the air at once and staying clearheaded in the clutter, you're better able to keep your eye on the ball and sell more. Ready, set, go. "

                "An intimate and profound reckoning with the changes buffeting the $2 trillion global advertising and marketing business from the perspective of its most powerful players, by the bestselling author of Googled Advertising and marketing touches on every corner of our lives, and is the invisible fuel powering almost all media. Complain about it though we might, without it the world would be a darker place. And of all the industries wracked by change in the digital age, few have been turned on its head as dramatically as this one has. We are a long way from the days of Don Draper; as Mad Men is turned into Math Men (and women\u2013though too few), as an instinctual art is transformed into a science, the old lions and their kingdoms are feeling real fear, however bravely they might roar. Frenemies is Ken Auletta's reckoning with an industry under existential assault. He enters the rooms of the ad world's most important players, some of them business partners, some adversaries, many \"frenemies,\" a term whose ubiquitous use in this industry reveals the level of anxiety, as former allies become competitors, and accusations of kickbacks and corruption swirl. We meet the old guard, including Sir Martin Sorrell, the legendary head of WPP, the world's largest ad agency holding company; while others play nice with Facebook and Google, he rants, some say Lear-like, out on the heath. There is Irwin Gotlieb, maestro of the media agency GroupM, the most powerful media agency, but like all media agencies it is staring into the headlights as ad buying is more and more done by machine in the age of Oracle and IBM. We see the world from the vantage of its new powers, like Carolyn Everson, Facebook's head of Sales, and other brash and scrappy creatives who are driving change, as millennials and others who disdain ads as an interruption employ technology to zap them. We also peer into the future, looking at what is replacing traditional advertising. And throughout we follow the industry's peerless matchmaker, Michael Kassan, whose company, MediaLink, connects all these players together, serving as the industry's foremost power broker, a position which feasts on times of fear and change. Frenemies is essential reading, not simply because of what it says about this world, but because of the potential consequences: the survival of media as we know it depends on the money generated by advertising and marketing\u2013revenue that is in peril in the face of technological changes and the fraying trust between the industry's key players.

                "Five years have passed since women were exhorted to 'Lean In'. Over that time, the world has transformed beyond all expectations. But why should anyone 'lean in' to a patriarchal system that is out of date? Why not change it entirely for the good of us all? In A Good Time to be a Girl, Helena Morrissey sets out how we might achieve the next big breakthrough towards a truly inclusive modern society. Drawing on her experience as a City CEO, mother of nine, and founder of the influential 30% Club which campaigns for gender-balanced UK company boards, her manifesto for new ways of working, living, loving and raising families is for everyone, not just women. Making a powerful case for diversity and difference in any workplace, she shows how, together, we can develop smarter thinking and broader definitions of success. Gender balance, in her view, is an essential driver of economic prosperity and part of the solution to the many problems we face today. Her approach is not aimed merely at training a few more women in working practices that have outlived their usefulness. Instead, this book sets out a way to reinvent the game &#8211; not at the expense of men but in ways that are right and relevant for a digital age. It is a powerful guide to success for us all. "

                "The bestselling co-author of the legendary The One Minute Manager&#174; and a former Twitter executive join forces to create the ultimate guide to creating powerful mentoring relationships. The past decade has seen the dramatic rise of a word now well known in corporate hallways: mentoring. But a new awareness about mentoring hasn't necessarily meant an increased understanding of how to implement the practice. While most people agree that having a mentor is a good thing, they don't know how to find one or use one. And despite widespread approval for the idea of being a mentor, most people don't think they have the time or skills to do so. Positive mentoring relationships can change the way we lead and help us succeed. In One Minute Mentoring, legendary management guru Ken Blanchard and Claire Diaz-Ortiz, a former Twitter executive and early employee, combine their knowledge to provide a systematic approach to intergenerational mentoring, giving readers great insight into the power and influence of mentoring and encouraging them to pursue their own mentoring relationships. Using his classic parable format, Blanchard explains why developing effective communication and relationships across generations can be a tremendous opportunity for companies and individuals alike. One Minute Mentoring is the go-to source for learning why mentoring is the secret ingredient to professional and personal success. "

                "An absolutely essential book for every modern football fan, about the development of Premier League tactics, published to coincide with 25 years of the competition.Back in 1992, English football was stuck in the dark ages, emerging from a five-year ban from European competition. The game was physical, bruising and attritional, based on strength over speed, aggression over finesse. It was the era of the midfield general, reducers, big men up front and getting it in the mixer; 4-4-2 was the order of the day. Few teams experimented tactically.And then, almost overnight, it all changed. The creation of the Premier League coincided with one of the most seismic rule changes in football history: the abolition of the back pass. Suddenly defenders had no get out of jail free card, goalkeepers had to be able to field and play the ball and the pace of the game quickened immeasurably. Tactics evolved dramatically, helped by an increased foreign influence.The Mixer is the first book to delve deep into the tactical story of the Premier League, and take a long view of how the game has developed over the last quarter century. From Ferguson's directness to Keegan's relentlessly attacking Newcastle outfit, to Mourinho's cagey, reactive Chelsea, all the way to Ranieri's counter-attacking champions, The Mixer is one of the most entertaining, rich and knowledgeable football books ever written.

                "Sales genius is a team sport. As a B2B sales leader, you know that by Murphy's Law, despite your team's best efforts, some deals will inevitably get stuck or key relationships will go sour. And too often, it's the most important ones&#8212;the last thing you need when millions of dollars are on the line.  \"Dealstorming\" is Tim Sanders's term for a structured, scalable, repeatable process that can break through any sales deadlock. He calls it \"a Swiss Army knife for today's toughest sales challenges.\" It fixes the broken parts of the brainstorming process and reinvigorates account management for today's increasingly complicated sales environment. Dealstorming drives sales innovation by combining the wisdom and creativity of everyone who has a stake in the sale. You may think you are applying teamwork to your challenges, but don't be so sure. There's a good chance you're operating inside a sales silo, not building a truly collaborative team across your whole company. The more disciplines you bring into the process, the more unlikely (but effective!) solutions the team can come up with.  Sanders explains his seven-step Dealstorming process and shows how it has helped drive results for companies as diverse as Yahoo!, CareerBuilder, Regus, and Cond&#233; Nast. You'll learn how to get the right team on board for a new dealstorm, relative to the size of the sales opportunity and its degree of difficulty. The key is adding people from non-sales areas of your company, making them collaborators early in the process. That will help them own the execution and delivery after the deal is done. The book includes real world examples from major companies like Oracle and Skillsoft, along with problem finding exercises, innovation templates, and implementation strategies you can apply to your unique situation. It's based on Sanders' many years as a sales executive and consultant, personally leading dozens of sales collaboration projects. It also features the results of interviews with nearly two hundred B2B sales leaders at companies such as LinkedIn, Altera and Novell.  The strategies laid out in Dealstorming have led to a stunning 70% average closing ratio for teams across all major industries, leading to game-changing deals and long-term B2B relationships. Now you can learn how to make dealstorming work for you.From the Hardcover edition. "

In its second edition, Fooled by Randomness is now a cornerstone for anyone interested in random outcomes.Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous forum in which luck is mistaken for skill, the world of trading, this audiobook is a captivating insight into one of the least understood factors of all our lives. In an entertaining narrative style, the author succeeds in tackling three major intellectual issues: the problem of induction, the survivorship biases, and our genetic unfitness to the modern word. Taleb uses stories and anecdotes to illustrate our overestimation of causality and the heuristics that make us view the world as far more explainable than it actually is.The audiobook is populated with an array of characters, some of whom have grasped, in their own way, the significance...

After the violence and chaos subsided, Bryant saw that his community needed a \"hand up, not a handout,\" so he founded Operation HOPE, an organization dedicated to helping low-wealth communities attain financial literacy empowerment. Today, Bryant is a sought-after speaker recognized for his leadership and service around the world. In Love Leadership, Bryant chronicles his story of transformation from a teenager growing up in South Los Angeles to the leader of one of the most impressive antipoverty organizations in the country, and shares the unlikely ingredient for his leadership success: love.

To answer this question, authors Dave Ulrich, Norm Smallwood, and Kate Sweetman set out to find the essentials of great leadership. Drawing on their decades of experience as academics, researchers, and consultants, the authors spent months talking to CEOs, experienced executives, respected academics, leadership researchers, and seasoned consultants. After asking them all, the question, \"What makes an effective leader?\" they identified the five things all great leaders do-the leadership code.
