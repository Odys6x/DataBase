                "\"McFarlane's skill in evoking individual inner lives and Jones's deftness in capturing their spirit make every character distinct.\" \u2014 The Washington Post  on The Sun Walks Down, one of  The Washington Post 's 10 Best Audiobooks of 2023 A gripping, enigmatic collection of linked short stories about the reverberations of a serial killer's crimes in the lives of everyday people.    In 1998, an apparently ordinary Australian man is arrested and charged for a series of brutal murders. The news shocks the nation, bringing both horror and resolution to the victims' families, but its impact travels even further: into the past, as the murders rewrite personal histories, and into the future, as true crime podcasts and biopics tell the story of the crimes.   Highway Thirteen , Fiona McFarlane's newest collection, takes murder as its starting point, but it unfolds to encompass much more: through the investigation of the aftermath of this violence across time and place, from the killer's childhood town to Texas, Rome, and tropical northern Australia, McFarlane presents an oblique, entrancing exploration of the way stories are told and spread, and at what cost.  What damages, big and small, do these crimes incur? How do communities make sense of such atrocities? How does the mourning of families sit alongside the public fascination with terrible crimes? And can we tell true crime stories without centering the killers? From the acclaimed author of  The Sun Walks Down  and  The High Places  comes a captivating account of loss and its extended echoes in individual lives.  A Macmillan Audio production from Farrar, Straus and Giroux. "

I loved this book.\u201d \u2013 Kelly Link, Pulitzer Prize finalist and bestselling author of  Get in Trouble  and  The Book of Love  \u201cWhat\u00a0I love most about  Ninetails  is its fierce allegiance\u00a0to underdogs of all kinds, its careful\u00a0and myriad\u00a0empathy\u00a0for its characters, but also its pure and artisanal\u00a0delight in language and fictive possibilities.\u201d \u2014Ocean Vuong,  New York Times -bestselling author of  On Earth, We're Briefly Gorgeous  and  Time is a Mother  A \u201clyrical and virtuosic\u201d fabulist debut collection of stories re-imagining the nine-tailed fox spirit of Asian folklore (Gina Chung).  A fox spirit avenges a teen girl by seducing her abuser. A shapeshifting woman finds herself chased through the woods by fox hunters; meanwhile, an assassination plot called Operation Fox Hunt unfolds against the last Queen of Korea. Chinese migrants hoping to make new lives as \u201cpaper children\u201d in America find their pasts\u2014and their hopes for the future\u2014embodied in the foxes that haunt the harbor in 1900s Angel Island. In the nine tales of  Ninetails,  acclaimed poet Sally Wen Mao reimagines the fox spirit from Asian folklore\u2014a shapeshifter, shaman, and seductress\u2014as an icon of vengeance, solidarity and liberation. The characters of her stories are varied\u2014from silicone sex dolls who come to life with new purpose, to women whose crushes manifest as stones\u2014but they all reach for a common purpose: to find truth and belonging in a difficult world determined to consider them alien. With the fabulist vibrancy of Carmen Maria Machado, the sinuous world-building of Helen Oyeyemi, and the sensuous feminist rage of Han Kang,  Ninetails  is both timeless\u2014unearthing a cultural icon whose origins date back over a thousand years\u2014and timely in its contemporary political urgency.

The New York stories, most of which take place around the year 2000, consider the fateful consequences that can spring from brief encounters and the delicate mechanics of compromise that operate at the heart of modern marriages.  In Towles\u2019s novel  Rules of Civility , the indomitable Evelyn Ross leaves New York City in September 1938 with the intention of returning home to Indiana. But as her train pulls into Chicago, where her parents are waiting, she instead extends her ticket to Los Angeles. Told from seven points of view, \u201cEve in Hollywood\u201d describes how Eve crafts a new future for herself\u2014and others\u2014in a noirish tale that takes us through the movie sets, bungalows, and dive bars of Los Angeles.  Written with his signature wit, humor, and sophistication,  Table for Two  is another glittering addition to Towles\u2019s canon of stylish and transporting fiction. "

                "The anti-rom-com debut collection that took Nigeria by storm, featuring twelve  \" bewitching and revelatory \"  (The New York Times) and  \" ridiculously entertaining \"  (Booklist starred review) stories about the perils and pitfalls of dating men in Lagos, from a rising star of Nollywood    \"Sharply observational, funny and profound, this book is dynamic sociological satire that is as universal as it is specific.\" \u2014Bolu Babalola, author of Reese's Book Club pick and national bestseller Honey and Spice    *INCLUDES A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN SNEAK PEEK OF DAMILARE KUKU'S FORTHCOMING NOVEL*   One night, you will calmly put a knife to your husband's private part and promise to cut it off. It will scare him so much that the next day, he will call his family members for a meeting in the house. He will not call your family members, but you will not care. You won't need them.   In this remarkable short story collection, Damilare Kuku takes us deep into the heart of modern Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, and the lives of a collection of audacious women who cope with romantic difficulties by brilliantly turning the tables on the men who wrong them.  One hardworking married woman calmly threatens sharp-edged revenge on her lazy, hypocritical husband. Another skillfully protects her own business interests by shielding her pastor-husband from allegations of cheating that may or may not be true. A group of wealthy wives deceived by their husbands join forces in a WhatsApp support group called the Virtuous Wives Guild. And a discerning dater fed up with Nigerian men makes a vow to date only oyibos before discovering that white men can act just as badly.  A bestseller in Damilare Kuku's native Nigeria, Nearly All the Men in Lagos Are Mad is a raunchy, satisfying, and outrageous read steeped in the chaos and allure of sub-Saharan Africa's largest city. It's also a love letter to Nigerian women: the women in these stories may be confronted at every turn with liars, scammers, and cheaters in their quests for love, but they always figure out how to come out victorious.

                "Set in a Lower East Side tenement in the early days of the COVID-19 lockdowns, Fourteen Days is an irresistibly propulsive collaborative novel from the Authors Guild, with an unusual twist: each character in this diverse, eccentric cast of New York neighbors has been secretly written by a different, major literary voice\u2014from Margaret Atwood and John Grisham to Tommy Orange and Celeste Ng.   One week into the COVID-19 shutdown, tenants of a Lower East Side apartment building in Manhattan have begun to gather on the rooftop and tell stories. With each passing night, more and more neighbors gather, bringing chairs and milk crates and overturned pails. Gradually the tenants\u2014some of whom have barely spoken to each other\u2014become real neighbors. In this Decameron-like serial novel, general editors Margaret Atwood and Douglas Preston and a star-studded list of contributors create a beautiful ode to the people who couldn't escape when the pandemic hit. A dazzling, heartwarming, and ultimately surprising narrative, Fourteen Days reveals how beneath the horrible loss and suffering, some communities managed to become stronger.  Includes writing from: Charlie Jane Anders, Margaret Atwood, Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet, Joseph Cassara, Angie Cruz, Pat Cummings, Sylvia Day, Emma Donoghue, Dave Eggers, Diana Gabaldon, Tess Gerritsen, John Grisham, Maria Hinojosa, Mira Jacob, Erica Jong, CJ Lyons, Celeste Ng, Tommy Orange, Mary Pope Osborne, Douglas Preston, Alice Randall, Ishmael Reed, Roxana Robinson, Nelly Rosario, James Shapiro, Hampton Sides, R.L.

The stories in  Fifty Beasts to Break Your Heart  are about the abomination that resides within us all. That churning, clawing, ravenous yearning: the hunger to be held, and seen, and known. And the terror, too: to be loved too well, or not enough, or for long enough. To be laid bare before your sweetheart, to their horror. To be recognized as the monstrous thing you are. Two teenage girls working at a sinister roadside attraction called the Eternal Staircase explore its secrets\u2014and their own doomed summer love. A zombie rooster plays detective in a missing persons case. A woman moves into a new house with her acclaimed artist boyfriend\u2014and finds her body slowly shifting into something specially constructed to accommodate his needs and whims. A pack of middle schoolers turn to the occult to rid themselves of a hated new classmate. And a pair of outcasts, a vampire and a goat woman, find solace in each other, even as the world's lack of understanding might bring about its own end. In these lush, strange, beautifully written stories, GennaRose Nethercott explores human longing in all its diamond-dark facets to create a collection that will redefine what you see as a beast, and make you beg to have your heart broken.

Months after the cops destroyed their home, the Carusos struggle to return to normal. Elsewhere, two former inmates reunite by chance on the set of a TV production. Both have found their way on the straight and narrow path, that is, until one sees the potential for an easy grift. A teenage boy must step into the man he'd like to be as a hostage crisis grips his hometown. A woman adrift meets a man tied to her grandmother's past, an encounter that awakens her to a bloody history that undergirds the place she grew up.   Pelecanos' portraits are characterized by shades of grey, resisting the mold of heroes and villains, victims and perpetrators, good and evil. At once streetwise and full of heart,  Owning Up  grapples with random chance, the bind of consequence, and the forked paths a life can take. "

                "From the internationally acclaimed author of  Cursed Bunny , in another thrilling translation from Korean by Anton Hur, this collection shares tales of loss and discovery, idealism and dystopia, death and immortality. \u200b   In \"The Center for Immortality Research,\" a low-level employee runs herself ragged planning a fancy gala for donors, only to be blamed for a crime she witnessed during the event, under the noses of the mysterious celebrity benefactors hoping to live forever. But she can't be fired\u2014no one can. In \"One More Kiss, Dear,\" a tender, one-sided love blooms in the AI-elevator of an apartment complex; as in, the elevator develops a profound affection for one of the residents. In \"Seeds,\" we see the final frontier of capitalism's destruction of the planet and the GMO companies who rule the agricultural industry, but nature has ways of creeping back to life.  Chung's writing is \"haunting, funny, gross, terrifying\u2014and yet when we reach the end, we just want more\" (Alexander Chee). If you haven't yet experienced the fruits of this singular imagination,  Your Utopia  is waiting.  \"Nothing concentrates the mind like Chung's terrors, which will shrivel you to a bouillon cube of your most primal instincts\" ( Vulture ), yet these stories are suffused with Chung's inimitable wry humor and surprisingly tender moments, too.

                "SHORTLISTED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL BOOKER PRIZE AND WINNER OF A PEN/HEIM TRANSLATION GRANT   \"Cool, brilliantly demented K-horror\u2014just the way I like it!\"  \u2014 Ed Park, author of  Personal Days    A stunning, wildly original debut from a rising star of Korean literature\u2014surreal, chilling fables that take on the patriarchy, capitalism, and the reign of big tech with absurdist humor and a (sometimes literal) bite.      From an author never before published in the United States,  Cursed Bunny  is unique and imaginative, blending horror, sci-fi, fairytales, and speculative fiction into stories that defy categorization. By turns thought-provoking and stomach-turning, here monsters take the shapes of furry woodland creatures and danger lurks in unexpected corners of everyday apartment buildings. But in this unforgettable collection, translated by the acclaimed Anton Hur, Chung's absurd, haunting universe could be our own, illuminating the ills of contemporary society.    \"The Head\" follows a woman haunted by her own bodily waste. \"The Embodiment\" takes us into a dystopian gynecology office where a pregnant woman is told that she must find a father for her baby or face horrific consequences. Another story follows a young monster, forced into underground fight rings without knowing the force of his own power. The titular fable centers on a cursed lamp in the approachable shape of a rabbit, fit for a child's bedroom but for its sinister capabilities.    No two stories are alike, and readers will be torn whether to race through them or savor Chung's wit and frenetic energy on every page.  Cursed Bunny  is a book that screams to be read late into the night and passed on to the nearest set of hands the very next day. "

We track our friends and family wherever they go. We have millennia of knowledge at our fingertips. We know everything about our world. But we know nothing about theirs. We have changed, but our ghosts have not. They've simply adapted and innovated, found new channels to reach us. They inhabit our apps and wander the metaverse just as they haunt our homes and our memories, always seeking new ways to connect. To live amongst us. To remind us. To tempt us. To take their revenge. These stories are not ours to tell. They are the stories of the dead - of those we've lost, loved, forgotten... and feared. Some are fiction. But some may not be. \u00a92023 Jeanette Winterson (P)2023 Penguin Audio. "

A family of cat farmers gets the chance to set the felines free. A group of chickens tells it like it is. A female-crewed ship ploughs through the patriarchy. A support group finds solace in a world without men. With her trademark humour, energy, and flair, McKay offers glimpses of places where dreams subsume reality, where childhood restarts, where humans embrace their animal selves and animals talk like humans. The stories in Gunflower explode and bloom in mesmerising ways, showing the world both as it is and as it could be. 'Startling, beautiful, and dangerous. McKay is the brightest of talents. We're lucky to have her.' ROBBIE ARNOTT, AUTHOR OF LIMBERLOST 'McKay delivers an assured follow-up to The Animals in That Country in her own singular voice that zeroes in on our anxieties and existential crises with deft and often poetic flair.'

McCorkle, author of the  New York Times  bestselling  Life After Life  and the widely acclaimed  Hieroglyphics  (\"One of our wryest, warmest, wisest storytellers\" \u2014Rebecca Makkai), brings us a breathtaking collection of stories that offers an intimate look at the moments when a person's life changes forever.  Old Crimes  delves into the lives of characters who hold their secrets and misdeeds close, even as the past continues to reverberate over time and across generations. And despite the characters' yearnings for connection, they can't seem to tell the whole truth. In \"Low Tones,\" a woman uses her hearing impairment as a way to guard herself from her husband's commentary. In \"Lineman,\" a telephone lineman strains to connect to his family even as he feels pushed aside in a digital world. In \"Confessional,\" a young couple buys a confessional booth for fun, only to discover the cost of honesty.  Profoundly moving and unforgettable, for fans of Alice Munro, Elizabeth Strout, and Lily King, the stories in  Old Crimes  reveal why McCorkle has long been considered a master of the form, probing lives full of great intensity, longing and affection, and deep regret.  \"Jill McCorkle has had an extraordinary ear for the music of ordinary life since the beginning of her career, able to work with the voices we know so well to write these stories about what they will not tell us, what they would rather not tell us, what they hope to tell us, what too often goes unsaid. And this collection is a new wonder.\" \u2014Alexander Chee, author of  How to Write an Autobiographical Novel. "

                "A new collection of stories from the cult author of Terminal Boredom Izumi Suzuki had ideas about doing things differently, ideas that paid little attention to the laws of physics, or the laws of the land. In this new collection, her skewed imagination distorts and enhances some of the classic concepts of science fiction and fantasy. A philandering husband receives a bestial punishment from a wife with her own secrets to keep; a music lover finds herself in a timeline both familiar and as wrong as can be; idle high school students find adventure in another dimension but aren't all that impressed; a misfit band of space pirates discover a mysterious baby among the stars; Emma, the Bovary-like character from one of Suzuki's stories in Terminal Boredom, lands herself in a bizarre romantic pickle. Wryly anarchic and deeply imaginative, Suzuki was a writer like no other. These eleven stories offer listeners the opportunity to delve deeper in this singular writer's work. "

                "An extraordinarily compelling debut\u2014ghost stories that grapple with the legacy of the Vietnam War    \u00a0   A beautiful young woman appears fully dressed in an overflowing bathtub at the Frangipani Hotel in Hanoi. A jaded teenage girl in Houston befriends an older Vietnamese gentleman she discovers naked behind a dumpster. A trucker in Saigon is asked to drive a dying young man home to his village. A plump Vietnamese-American teenager is sent to her elderly grandmother in Ho Chi Minh City to lose weight, only to be lured out of the house by the wafting aroma of freshly baked bread. In these evocative and always surprising stories, the supernatural coexists with the mundane lives of characters who struggle against the burdens of the past.  \u00a0  Based on traditional Vietnamese folk tales told to Kupersmith by her grandmother, these fantastical, chilling, and thoroughly contemporary stories are a boldly original exploration of Vietnamese culture, addressing both the immigrant experience and the lives of those who remained behind. Lurking in the background of them all is a larger ghost\u2014that of the Vietnam War, whose legacy continues to haunt us.  \u00a0  Violet Kupersmith\u2019s voice is an exciting addition to the landscape of American fiction. With tremendous depth and range, her stories transcend their genre to make a wholly original statement about the postwar experience.  \u00a0   Praise for  The Frangipani Hotel \u00a0   \u201c[A] subversively clever debut collection . . .

Perchance to Dream  contains a selection of Beaumont's finest stories, including five that he later adapted for  Twilight Zone  episodes.  Beaumont dreamed up fantasies so vast and varied they burst through the walls of whatever box might contain them. Supernatural, horror, noir, science fiction, fantasy, pulp, and more\u2014all were equally at home in his wondrous mind. These are stories where lions stalk the plains, classic cars rove the streets, and spacecraft hover just overhead. Here roam musicians, magicians, vampires, monsters, toreros, extraterrestrials, androids, and perhaps even the Devil himself. With dizzying feats of master storytelling and joyously eccentric humor, Beaumont transformed his nightmares and reveries into impeccably crafted stories that leave themselves indelibly stamped upon the walls of the mind. In Beaumont's hands, nothing is impossible; it all seems plausible, even likely. "

In the village of Yiwei, a fallen wasp nest unfurls into a beautifully accurate map. In a field in Louisiana, birdwatchers forge an indelible connection over a shared glimpse of a Vermilion Flycatcher. In Nineveh, a judge who prides himself on impartiality finds himself questioned by a mysterious god. On a nameless shore, a small monster searches for refuge and finds unexpected courage. At turns bittersweet and boundary-breaking, poignant and profound, these stories sing, as the oldest fables do, of what it means to be alive in this strange, terrible, beautiful world.

                "\"Without stories, we cannot live well,\" shares guest editor Min Jin Lee, describing how storytelling affects and nurtures readers. The Best American Short Stories 2023 features twenty pieces of short fiction that reflect a world full of fractured relationships, but also wondrous hope. A lifelong friendship may become a casualty of the Russia-Ukraine war. Rejected by his lover, a man seeks to reconcile with his family. Twitter users miraculously muster enough empathy to help a lost cat find a forever home. Enlightening, poignant, and undeniably human, the stories in this anthology bravely confront societal darkness and offer, in Lee's words, \"our emotional truths, restoring our sanity and providing comfort for the days ahead.\"  The Best American Short Stories 2023 includes Cherline Bazile   Maya Binyam   Tom Bissell   Taryn Bowe   Da-Lin   Benjamin Ehrlich  Sara Freeman   Lauren Groff   Nathan Harris   Jared Jackson   Sana Krasikov   Danica Li   Ling Ma   Manuel Mu\u00f1oz   Joanna Pearson   Souvankham Thammavongsa   Kosiso Ugwueze   Corinna Vallianatos   Azareen Van Der Vliet Oloomi   Esther Yi.

The transporting stories in this year's The Best American Mystery and Suspense are populated by those who exist on the fringe of our society and want more than what life has dealt them: A haunted veteran turned career criminal is on the run. An injured fighter turned bouncer seeks vengeance for his lost love. An assassin on his last job finds himself questioning his life choices and breaks all the rules to understand his final victim. By turns thrilling and enlightening, each story, according to Unger, \"will have you holding your breath, flipping the pages, will leave you thinking about people and why they do the dark, dangerous, frightening things that they do.\"  The Best American Mystery and Suspense 2023 includes Ashley-\u00adRuth M.

                "A delightfully funny, fantastically inventive collection of twenty newly unearthed short stories by Sir Terry Pratchett, the award-winning and bestselling author of the phenomenally successful Discworld fantasy series. This special trove is a must-have for Pratchett fans of all ages and includes a foreword by Neil Gaiman. The audiobook is narrated by a stunning cast that includes David Tennant, Claire Foy, Paterson Joseph, Indira Varma, and more!   These rediscovered tales were written by Terry Pratchett under a pseudonym for British newspapers during the 1970s and 1980s. The stories have never been attributed to him until now, and might never have been found\u2014were it not for the efforts of a few dedicated fans.   As Neil Gaiman writes in his introduction, \"through all of these stories we watch young Terry Pratchett becoming Terry Pratchett.\" Though none of the short works are set in the Discworld, all are infused with Pratchett's trademark wit, satirical wisdom, and brilliant imagination, hinting at the magical universe he would go on to create.  Meet Og the inventor, the first caveman to cultivate fire, as he discovers the highs and lows of progress; haunt the Ministry of Nuisances with the defiant evicted ghosts of Pilgarlic Towers; visit Blackbury, a small market town with weird weather and an otherworldly visitor; and embark on a dangerous quest through time and space with hero Kron, which begins in the ancient city of Morpork.  Irresistibly entertaining, A Stroke of the Pen is an essential collection from the great Terry Pratchett, a \"master storyteller\" (A. S. Byatt) who \"defies categorization\" (The Times).  The full cast of narrators includes:  David Tennant  Claire Foy  Paterson Joseph  Stephen Briggs  Nigel Planer  Tony Robinson  Katherine Parkinson  Indira Varma  John Culshaw  Mathew Baynton  Richard Coyle  Derek Jacobi  David Jason  Steffan Rhodri  Maggie Service  Hallie Morahan  Jason Watkins  Rhianna Pratchett  Rob Wilkins  Colin Smythe  Neil Gaiman.

From the beloved award-winning author Paul Yoon comes a spectacular collection of unique stories, each confronting themes of identity, belonging, and the collision of cultures across countries and centuries.  A boy searches for his father, a prison guard on Sakhalin Island. In Barcelona, a woman is tasked with spying on a prizefighter who may or may not be her estranged son. A samurai escorts an orphan to his countrymen in the Edo Period. A formerly incarcerated man starts a new life in a small town in upstate New York and attempts to build a family.     The Hive and the Honey  is a bold and indelible collection by celebrated author Paul Yoon, one that portrays the vastness and complexity of diasporic communities, with each story bringing to light the knotty inheritances of their characters. How does a North Korean defector connect with the child she once left behind? What are the traumas that haunt a Korean settlement in Far East Russia?   Lauded as a \"quotidian - surreal craft - master\" ( New York  magazine), Yoon's stunning stories are laced with beauty and cruelty, and  The Hive and the Honey  is the work of an author writing at the very height of his powers.

Van Alst Jr. \u2022 Richard Van Camp \u2022 David Heska Wanbli Weiden \u2022 Royce Young Wolf \u2022 Mathilda Zeller   Many Indigenous people believe that one should never whistle at night. This belief takes many forms: for instance, Native Hawaiians believe it summons the Hukai\u2019po, the spirits of ancient warriors, and Native Mexicans say it calls Lechuza, a witch that can transform into an owl. But what all these legends hold in common is the certainty that whistling at night can cause evil spirits to appear\u2014and even follow you home.  These wholly original and shiver-inducing tales introduce readers to ghosts, curses, hauntings, monstrous creatures, complex family legacies, desperate deeds, and chilling acts of revenge. Introduced and contextualized by bestselling author Stephen Graham Jones, these stories are a celebration of Indigenous peoples\u2019 survival and imagination, and a glorious reveling in all the things an ill-advised whistle might summon.

                "Black Mirror meets Get Out in this gripping story collection reminiscent of the work of Octavia E. Butler, which deftly blends science fiction, horror, and fantasy to examine issues of race, class, and prejudice\u2014an electrifying, oftentimes heartbreaking debut from an extraordinary new voice.   Justin C. Key has long been obsessed with monsters. Reading R. L. Stine's Goosebumps as a kid, he imagined himself battling monsters and mayhem to a triumphant end. But when watching Scream 2, in which the movie's only Black couple is promptly killed off, he realized that the Black and Brown characters in his favorite genre were almost always the victim or villain\u2014if they were portrayed at all.  In The World Wasn't Ready for You, Key expands and subverts the horror genre to expertly explore issues of race, class, prejudice, love, exclusion, loneliness, and what it means to be a person in the world, while revealing the horrifying nature inherent in all of us. In the opening story, \"The Perfection of Theresa Watkins,\" a sci-fi love story turned nightmare, a husband uses new technology to download the consciousness of his recently deceased Black wife into the body of a white woman. In \"Spider King,\" an inmate agrees to participate in an experimental medical study offered to Black prisoners in exchange for early release, only to find his body reacting with disturbing symptoms. And in the title story, a father tries to protect his son, teaching him how to navigate a prejudiced world that does not understand him and sees him as a threat.  The World Wasn't Ready for You is a gripping, provocative, and distinctly original collection that demonstrates Key's remarkable literary gifts\u2014a skill at crafting science fiction stories equaled by an ability to sculpt characters and narrative\u2014as well as his utterly fresh take on how genre can be used to delight, awe, frighten, and ultimately challenge our perceptions. Wildly imaginative and powerfully resonant, it introduces an unforgettable new voice in fiction. "

A new collection\u2014about loss, alienation, aging, and the strangeness of contemporary life\u2014by the award-winning, and inimitable, author of   The Book of Goose.   A grieving mother makes a spreadsheet of everyone she's lost. Elsewhere, a professor develops a troubled intimacy with her hairdresser. And every year, a restless woman receives an email from a strange man twice her age and several states away. In Yiyun Li's stories, people strive for an ordinary existence until doing so becomes unsustainable, until the surface cracks and the grand mysterious forces\u2014death, violence, estrangement\u2014come to light. And even everyday life is laden with meaning, studded with indelible details: a filched jar of honey, a mound of wounded ants, a photograph kept hidden for many years, until it must be seen. Li is a truly original writer, an alchemist of opposites: tender and unsentimental, metaphysical and blunt, funny and horrifying, omniscient and unusually aware of just how much we cannot know. Beloved for her novels and memoirs, she returns here to her earliest form, gathering pieces that have appeared in  The New Yorke r,  Zoetrope , and elsewhere. Taken together, the stories in  Wednesday's Child , written over the span of a decade, articulate the cost, both material and emotional, of living\u2014exile, assimilation, loss, love\u2014with her trademark unnerving beauty and wisdom.  A Macmillan Audio production from Farrar, Straus and Giroux. "

                "From six bestselling authors, including New York Times bestseller Kate Quinn, comes a vividly imagined novel following the lives of those in ancient Pompeii on the fateful day Mount Vesuvius erupts.   Pompeii was a lively resort flourishing in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius at the height of the Roman Empire. When Vesuvius erupted in an explosion of flame and ash, the entire town would be destroyed. Some of its citizens died in the chaos, some escaped the mountain's wrath . . . and these are their stories:  A boy loses his innocence in Pompeii's flourishing streets.  An heiress dreads her wedding day, not knowing it will be swallowed by fire.  An ex-legionary stakes his entire future on a gladiator bout destined never to be finished.  A crippled senator welcomes death, until a tomboy on horseback comes to his rescue.  A young mother faces an impossible choice for her unborn child as the ash falls.  A priestess and a prostitute seek redemption and resurrection as the town is buried.  Six authors bring to life overlapping stories of patricians and slaves, warriors and politicians, villains and heroes who cross each other's paths during Pompeii's fiery end. But who will escape, and who will be buried for eternity?  Text copyright 2023 by Stephanie Dray, Ben Kane, Eliza Knight, Sophie Perinot, Kate Quinn, Victoria Alvear, and Michelle Moran. "

In stories set across the US and Asia, Alexandra Chang immerses us in the lives of immigrant families, grocery store employees, expecting parents, and guileless lab assistants.  A woman known only to her neighbors as \"the Asian recycling lady\" collects bottles from the streets she calls home. A young college grad ponders the void left from a broken friendship. An unfulfilled housewife in Shanghai finds a secret outlet for her ambitions in an undercover gambling den. Two strangers become something more through the bond of mistaken identity.  These characters, adeptly attuned to the mystery of living, invite us to consider whether it is possible for anyone to entirely do right by another. Tomb Sweeping brims with remarkable skill and talent in every story, keeping a definitive pulse on loss, community, and what it means to feel fully alive. With her debut story collection, Chang further establishes herself as \"a writer to watch\" (New York Times Book Review). "

                "Award-winning short story writer Ann Beattie returns with a brilliant collection of linked stories set in Charlottesville, Virginia, in a moment of unrest.    Onlookers  is an astute new story collection about people living in the same Southern town whose lives intersect in surprising ways. Peaceful Charlottesville, Virginia, drew national attention when white nationalists held a rally there in 2017, a horrific event whose repercussions are still felt today. Confederate monuments such as General Robert E. Lee atop his horse were then still standing. The statues are a constant presence and a metaphoric refrain throughout this collection, though they represent different things to different characters. Some landmarks may have faded from consciousness but provoke fresh outrage when viewed through newly opened eyes.   In \"Nearby,\" an elderly man and his younger wife watch from their penthouse as protestors gather to oppose the once \"heroic\" explorers Lewis and Clark depicted towering over their native guide, Sacagawea. A lawyer in \"In the Great Southern Tradition\" deals with a crisis on Richmond's Monument Avenue, while his sister and nephew plant tulip bulbs at her stately home.   These are stories of unexpected relationships and affiliations that affirm the value of friendship, even when it requires difficult compromises or unexpected risks. Beattie involves the reader in questions about the nature of community, as the characters grapple with complicated inheritances that are both historical and personal and the realities of their lives interact uneasily with the past.

Appearing in audio for the first time, \"Amnesty\" is a story of a woman named Noah who works to negotiate the tense and co-dependent relationship between humans and a species of invaders. Also new to this collection is \"The Book of Martha\" which asks: What would you do if God granted you the ability\u2014and responsibility\u2014to save humanity from itself?  Like all of Octavia Butler's best writing, these works of the imagination are parables of the contemporary world. She proves constant in her vigil, an unblinking pessimist hoping to be proven wrong, and one of contemporary literature's strongest voices. "

                "This \"gorgeous, electric\" collection of short stories is about the inner lives of young women during their transformative twenties, navigating relationships, nostalgia for the past, and the uncertainty of the future (Mary-Beth Hughes, author of  The Ocean House ).   With this sharp and witty debut collection, author Kate Doyle captures precisely that time of life when so many young women are caught in between, pre-occupied by nostalgia for past relationships\u2014with friends, roommates, siblings\u2014while trying to move forward into an uncertain future. In \"That Is Shocking,\" a college student relates a darkly funny story of romantic humiliation, one that skirts the parallel story of a friend she betrayed. In others, young women long for friends who have moved away, or moved on. In \"Cinnamon Baseball Coyote\" and other linked stories about siblings Helen, Evan, and Grace, their years of inside jokes and brutal tensions simmer over as the three spend a holiday season in an amusing whirl of rivalry and mutual attachment, and a generational gulf widens between them and their parents. Throughout, in stories both lyrical and haunting, young women search for ways to break free from the expectations of others and find a way to be in the world.   Written with crystalline prose and sly humor, the stories in  I Meant It Once  build to complete a profoundly recognizable portrait of early adulthood and the ways in which seemingly incidental moments can come to define the stories we tell ourselves. For fans of Elif Batuman, Ottessa Moshfegh, Patricia Lockwood, and Melissa Bank, these stories about being young and adrift in today's world go down easy and pack a big punch. "

A brilliant young philosophy student bent on seducing her famous philosopher-mentor finds herself outmaneuvered; diabolically clever high school girls wreak a particularly apt sort of vengeance on sexual predators in their community; a woman stalked by a would-be killer may be confiding in the wrong former lover; a young woman is morbidly obsessed by her unfamiliar new role as \"mother.\" In the collection's longest story, a much-praised cutting-edge writer cruelly experiments with \"drafts\" of his own suicide. In these powerfully wrought stories that hold a mirror up to our time, Joyce Carol Oates has created a world of erotic obsession, thwarted idealism, and ever-shifting identities. Provocative and stunning, Zero-Sum reinforces Oates's standing as a literary treasure and an artist of the mysterious interior life. 'Zero-Sum is brilliant \u2013 bloodied, breathless, weird' A. K. Blakemore, author of The Manningtree Witches 'A fierce chronicler of survival against the odds ... Unstoppable' Ali Smith 'Oates is an inspired writer, and a formidable psychologist' Independent. "

                "A haunting collection of short fiction from the bestselling author of The Pallbearers Club, A Head Full of Ghosts, and The Cabin at the End of the World.    Paul Tremblay has won widespread acclaim for illuminating the dark horrors of the mind in novels and stories that push the boundaries of storytelling itself. The fifteen pieces in this brilliant collection, The Beast You Are, are all monsters of a kind, ready to loudly (and lovingly) smash through your head and into your heart.  In \"The Dead Thing,\" a middle-schooler struggles to deal with the aftermath of her parents' substance addictions and split. One day, her little brother claims he found a shoebox with \"the dead thing\" inside. He won't show it to her and he won't let the box out of his sight. In \"The Last Conversation,\" a person wakes in a sterile, white room and begins to receive instructions via intercom from a woman named Anne. When they are finally allowed to leave the room to complete a task, what they find is as shocking as it is heartbreaking.  The title novella, \"The Beast You Are,\" is a mini epic in which the destinies and secrets of a village, a dog, and a cat are intertwined with a giant monster that returns to wreak havoc every thirty years.  A masterpiece of literary horror and psychological suspense, The Beast You Are is a fearlessly imagined collection from one of the most electrifying and innovative writers working today. "

Joan Silber skilfully and subtly ties one story to the next, as a minor element in one becomes a major element in the next, until the last is tied convincingly to the first. Intense in subject yet restrained in tone, they are about longings - often held for years - and the ways in which sex and religion can become parallel forms of dedication and comfort. From a wannabe dancer in contemporary New York City to missionaries in China, Ideas of Heaven showcases Joan Silber's extraordinary deftness as she illuminates love, faith and sex with great originality and profundity.

As she considers moving to California to join La Causa, Mexican American activist Cesar Chavez's movement to improve the working conditions of migrant farmer workers, Katia receives an unexpected gift from her father: a plane ticket to Mexico City. Bring back your mother, he says, tell her, her children need her. And so Katia joins this cause, to get Tina back to Chicago. But it won't be easy.

Katia is but one of the voices introduced in this dazzling collection of short fiction from revered writer Ana Castillo. Spanning from Chicago to Mexico to New Mexico, the stories in Do\u00f1a Cleanwell Leaves Home illuminate a chorus of people whose stories will leave you breathless. "

                "A fresh, thoughtful, and always surprising short story collection from a rising young star in the world of Japanese literature.    Composed of the title novella and three short stories, People Who Talk to Stuffed Animals Are Nice sensitively explores gender, friendship, romance, love, human interaction and its absence, and how a misogynistic society limits women and men.  In the title story, Nanamori and Mugito, two university students appalled by society's gendered roles, rebel. Refusing to interact with other people they use stuffed toys for emotional support. Unlike Nanamori and Mugito, their fellow plushie society member Shiraki does not talk to plushies. Pragmatic, she accepts the status quo that boys sometimes make nasty jokes; she believes their behavior resembles the real world.  In \"Realizing Fun Things Through Water,\" a young woman named Hatsuoka must contend with a mother-in-law who swears by cancer-preventing \"hyper-organization\" water, and a sister who writes fake news for a living. \"Bath Towel Visuals\" illuminates the mental cost of not just laughing along at mean humor, while \"Hello, Thank You I'm Okay\" follows a family's response when their shut-in son announces he wants to throw himself a birthday party.  Written in brisk and gentle prose, Ao Omae's stories capture the subtleties and complexities of his characters' inner world, individuals struggling to conform in an inflexible society little tolerant of difference. These stories, sometimes comical, sometimes bittersweet, and always thought-provoking, speak to the pain and desires of all who embrace nuance, repudiate traditional sex roles, and long for a gentler and more tolerant world.

                "Seven ingeniously reinvented fairy tales that play out with astonishing consequences in the modern world, from one of today's finest short story writers \u2013 MacArthur 'Genius Grant' Fellow Kelly Link, bestselling author of the Pulitzer Prize finalist Get in Trouble. Finding seeds of inspiration in the Brothers Grimm, seventeenth-century French lore, and Scottish ballads, Kelly Link spins classic fairy tales into utterly original stories of seekers \u2013 characters on the hunt for love, connection, revenge, or their own sense of purpose. In 'The White Cat's Divorce', an aging billionaire sends his three sons on a series of absurd goose chases to decide which will become his heir. In 'The Girl Who Did Not Know Fear', a professor with a delicate health condition becomes stranded for days in an airport hotel after a conference, desperate to get home to her wife and young daughter, and in acute danger of being late for an appointment that cannot be missed. In 'Skinder's Veil', a young man agrees to take over a remote house-sitting gig for a friend. But what should be a chance to focus on his long-avoided dissertation instead becomes a wildly unexpected journey, as the house seems to be a portal for otherworldly travelers \u2013 or perhaps a door into his own mysterious psyche. Twisting and winding in astonishing ways, expertly blending realism and the speculative, witty, empathetic, and never predictable \u2013 these stories remind us once again of why Kelly Link is incomparable in the art of short fiction.

Orbiting the devastating financial crisis of 1997, these interwoven stories introduce us to three families\u2014a Thai Elvis impersonator and his only daughter, a family abandoned by their white American patriarch, and an adoptive brotherhood of orphaned boys\u2014who employ various schemes and strategies to conceal, betray, lie, and seduce their way to achieving the \"good\" life. Wildly imaginative and ambitious, Mai Nardone's stories capture the growing discrepancy between Thailand's smiling self-image and its ugly obverse. Through skin-whitening routines, cult conversion, Elvis costumery, gambling, and sex work, the collection's characters look for reinvention in a city unmade by a financial crisis, in a kingdom caught between this world and the next. \"A writer with an atlas straight to the heart.\" ?

                "Ernest Hemingway's landmark short story of a veteran's solo fishing trip in Michigan's rugged Upper Peninsula, featuring a revelatory foreword by John N. Maclean.   \"A century since its publication in the collection In Our Time, \"Big Two-Hearted River\" has helped shape language and literature in America and across the globe, and its magnetic pull continues to draw readers, writers, and critics. The story is the best early example of Ernest Hemingway's now-familiar writing style: short sentences, punchy nouns and verbs, few adjectives and adverbs, and a seductive cadence. Easy to imitate, difficult to match. The subject matter of the story has inspired generations of writers to believe that fly fishing can be literature. More than any of his stories, it depends on his 'iceberg theory' of literature, the notion that leaving essential parts of a story unsaid, the underwater portion of the iceberg, adds to its power. Taken in context with his other work, it marks Hemingway's passage from boyish writer to accomplished author: nothing big came before it, novels and stories poured out after it.\" \u2014from the foreword by John N. Maclean. "

                "A startling and vivid debut novel in stories from acclaimed poet and translator Fiona Sze-Lorrain, featuring deeply compelling Asian women who reckon with the past, violence, and exile\u2014set in Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore, Paris, and New York.    Composed of several interconnected stories, each taking place in a year ending with the number six, ironically a number that in Chinese divination signifies \"a smooth life,\"  Dear Chrysanthemums  is a novel about the scourge of inhumanity, survival, and past trauma that never leaves. The women in these stories are cooks, musicians, dancers, protestors, mothers and daughters, friends and enemies, all inexplicably connected in one way or another.     \"Cooking for Madame Chiang,\" 1946:  Two cooks work for Madame Chiang Kai-shek and prepare a foreign dish craved by their mistress, which becomes a political weapon and leads to their tragic end.     \"Death at the Wukang Mansion,\" 1966:  Punished for her extramarital affair, a dancer is transferred to Shanghai during the Cultural Revolution and assigned to an ominous apartment in a building whose other residents often depart in coffins.     \"The White Piano,\" 1966:  A budding pianist from New York City settles down in Paris and is assaulted when a mysterious piano arrives from Singapore.     \"The Invisible Window,\" 2016:  After their exile following the Tiananmen Square massacre, three women gather in a French cathedral to renew their friendship and reunite in their grief and faith.    With devastating precision, a masterly ear for language, and a profound understanding of both human cruelty and compassion, Fiona Sze-Lorrain weaves  Dear Chrysanthemums , an evocative and disturbing portrait of diasporic life, the shared story of uprooting, resilience, artistic expression, and enduring love.

An amusement park employee overdoses after eating the gel of a fentanyl patch. Two homeless men discover the body of a drowned woman. A sister encounters a dangerous stranger while driving her brother to rehab. Ex-lovers seek to rekindle their relationship with the aid of an earthquake.   In the nine masterful stories that comprise  Thrillville, USA , debut author Taylor Koekkoek depicts Americans living on the margins of society, seeking escape from isolation and underemployment in drugs, booze, and self-destructive relationships. While the action is set largely in the rural Pacific Northwest, the characters' malaise and disaffectedness is endemic of the country as a whole. The title takes its name from the aforementioned amusement park, but Thrillville is as much a state of mind as an actual place\u2014a sardonic commentary on contemporary America consumed by opioid addiction, social media obsession, wealth inequality and political polarization.   Yet as haunting as these stories are, they are not hopeless. Gorgeously written, they share a transcendental quality\u2014an acknowledgment of and appreciation for the beauty in all things, even the most profane and grotesque. "

                "Come closer, friend. Let me tell you a story.  Heard the one about the Airbnb that eats your dreams or the iron-crowned king who preys on his own bloodline from the air, still smoldering centuries after being burnt alive? How about the cloudy antique bottle you can wish your excess rage inside, or that crooked alley down which something waits to replace your disappointing child with a far more pleasant facsimile? We all know the truth, especially in times like these\u2014in an anxiety-ridden, sleepless world such as ours, it's only ever our very worst dreams that come true. Here streets empty out and people pull themselves apart like amoebas, breeding murderous doppelgangers from their own flesh; houses haunt, ideas possess, and a cold and alien moon stares down, whispering that it's time to spawn. New myths rise and ancient evils descend. From the seemingly mundane terrors of a city just like yours to all the most dark and distant places of a truly terrible universe, nothing is as it seems ... not even that dimly-recalled cinematic memory you've been chasing all these years, the one you think might be just something you stumbled upon while flipping through channels after midnight. The one that still disturbs you enough to raise a cold sweat all over your body, whenever you try to will its details clear.  Hot on the heels of her 2018 This Is Horror Award\u2013winning short story collection Spectral Evidence, critically horror author Gemma Files compiles fifteen more of her most startling recent nightmares\u2014a creepily seductive downward spiral of dark poetry and existential dread, entirely suitable to the slow apocalypse going on all around us. So take your mind off your troubles and send it somewhere the rules still operate, if only to punish those who violate them. "

                "A debut, interlinked collection of stories exploring the primal nature of women???s grief???offering insight into the profound experience of loss and the absurd ways in which we seek control in an unruly world.   Seamlessly shifting between the speculative and the blindingly real, balancing the bizarre with the subtle brutality of the mundane, A Manual for How to Love Us is a tender portrait of women trying their best to survive, love, and find genuine meaning in the aftermath of loss.  In these unconventional and unpredictably connected stories, Erin Slaughter shatters the stereotype of the soft-spoken, sorrowful woman in distress, queering the domestic and honoring the feral in all of us. In each story, grieving women embrace their wildest impulses as they attempt to master their lives: one woman becomes a ???gazer??? at a fraternity house, another slowly moves into her otherworldly stained-glass art, a couple speaks only in their basement???s black box, and a thruple must decide what to do when one partner disappears.  The women in Erin Slaughter???s stories suffer messy breaks, whisper secrets to the ghosts tangled in the knots of their hair, eat raw meat to commune with their inner wolves, and build deadly MLM schemes along the Gulf Coast.  Set across oft-overlooked towns in the American South, A Manual for How to Love Us spotlights women who are living on the brink and clinging to its precipitous edge. Lyrical and surprisingly humorous, A Manual for How to Love Us is an exciting debut that reveals the sticky complications of living in a body, in all its grotesquerie and glory. "

Ligotti\u2019s stories take on decaying cities and lurid dreamscapes in a style ranging from rich, ornamental prose to cold, clinical detachment. His raw and experimental work lays bare the unimportance of our world and the sickening madness of the human condition. Like the greatest writers of cosmic horror, Ligotti bends reality until it cracks, opening fissures through which he invites us to gaze on the unsettling darkness of the abyss below.

                "For the first time ever, a complete collection of short fiction the  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Queen's Gambit   Walter Tevis is widely regarded as a master for both his gritty poolhall novels and his brilliant rendering of the world of competitive chess. This long overdue collection establishes Tevis's rightful place as a maestro of the short form, as well. Bringing together the 1981 short story collection  Far From Home  with a host of other previously unpublished stories from journals and magazines, this entertaining collection showcases Tevis's characteristic perceptiveness, empathy, and range. In one story, a man receives a phone call from his future self and follows their instructions to unpreditcable, calamitous results. In another, a famous actor and a young actress showcase their talent for acting both on and off the stage. Here also are five short stories set in poolhalls, including one that features Fast Eddie Felson and another that was the basis for the novel  The Hustler . Here also is his first fictional foray into chess, with a ranked chess player finding fellowship in the prison yard with another player. In all of them, Tevis reminds again and again why his writing has long been revered for its roving curiosity and innate humanity. "

Each story is unique, yet universal.  In this book, the impact of wildfire, a wayward priest, or a mysterious disappearance ricochet across communities, threading through stories. Here, ordinary actions such as ice skating or going to church reveal hidden truths. One choice threatens a lifelong friendship. Siblings save each other. Rescue and second chances are possible, and so is revenge.  On the surface, it seems that nothing ever happens in these towns. But Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock shows that underneath that surface, teenagers' lives blaze with fury, with secrets, and with love so strong it burns a path to the future. "
