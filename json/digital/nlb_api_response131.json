                "This publication is the result of a research project by students of the Landscape Architecture (MLA) programme at National University of Singapore. The students are tasked to develop a cycling landscape infrastructure for the One-North District. The aim of the project is to reduce reliance on cars, and to encourage cycling. A better cycling infrastructure therefore, had to be developed and the site chosen is One-North, a 200-hectare development of research facilities. The students propose to transform One-North into a cyclable district. The outcome of their project is this report, which documents their sequential studio process in coming up with the designs. The report also proposes three distinct design outcomes."

                "\"Vietnam has achieved sustained economic growth, primarily driven by a rapidly expanding labor force and a shift in economic activity away from low-productivity subsistence agriculture toward the higher-productivity manufacturing and services sectors. However, the country's socioeconomic success is now facing both short- and long-term challenges. Over the longer term, Vietnam is faced with the challenge that its main drivers of past growth are being depleted and need to be replaced by intra-sectoral productivity improvements. More efficient transport and logistics can play a significant role in increasing productivity. Competitiveness enhancements can better position Vietnam to benefit from global demand, to better serve domestic markets, to attract investment, and to generate quality jobs. This publication highlights opportunities to make freight itineraries more reliable, to make roads safer and more conducive to high-volume commercial use, to increase port sector efficiencies, and to better integrate barges, trucks, warehouses, and gateways. It also proposes interventions and policies that can address both short-term and long-term challenges. This work is divided into four detailed chapters: 1) overview, 2) Vietnam's current situation, 3) freight stakeholder challenges and opportunities, and 4) issues screening and list of actionable recommendations.\"-- Publisher description.

Both terms embody the notion of a digital world in which many transactions and data flows animate a virtual space. This is the unseen world in which technology has become the master, with the hand of the human less visible. In fact, however, it is human interaction in and around technology that makes data so pervasive and important - the ability of the human mind to extract, manipulate and shape data that gives meaning to it. This book outlines the findings and conclusions of a multi-disciplinary team of data scientists, lawyers and economists tasked with studying both the possibilities of exploiting the rich datasets made available from many human-technology interactions, and the practical and legal limitations in trying to do so. It revolves around a core case study of Singapore's public transport system, using data both from the private company operating the contactless payment system (EZ-Link) and the government agency responsible for public transport infrastructure (LTA). In analysing both the possibilities and the limitations of these datasets, the authors propose policy recommendations both in-terms of uses for large datasets and the legislation necessary to enable these uses while protecting the privacy of users\"-- Provided by publisher.

Lean Logistics updates Air Force logistics operations by applying technology and management innovations that have proven effective in the commercial world, are relevant to the central supply problems of the Air Force, and are affordable. The analysis in this study used Air Force data to drive simulations of C-5 logistics operations and considered peacetime flying programs. This study found that a high-velocity infrastructure would provide C-5 performance that is the same as or better than that provided by the current infrastructure across a wide range of conditions and circumstances. A high-velocity infrastructure would require only one-sixth the amount of inventory at one-third the cost of the current infrastructure to produce the same operational performance. "

                "The Great Thorpe Railway Disaster of 1874 is the third title from Norwich writer and biographer Phyllida Scrivens, who lives less than half a mile from the site of the fatal collision. At Norwich Station on 10 September 1874, a momentary misunderstanding between the Night Inspector and young Telegraph Clerk resulted in an inevitable head-on collision. The residents of the picturesque riverside village of Thorpe-Next-Norwich were shocked by a 'deafening peal of thunder', sending them running through the driving rain towards a scene of destruction. Surgeons were summoned from the city, as the dead, dying and injured were taken to a near-by inn and boatyard. Every class of Victorian society was travelling that night, including ex-soldiers, landowners, clergymen, doctors, seamstresses, saddlers, domestic servants and a beautiful heiress. For many months local and national newspapers followed the story, publishing details of subsequent deaths, manslaughter trial and outcomes of record-breaking compensation claims. The Board of Trade Inquiry concluded that it was 'the most serious collision between trains meeting one another on a single line of rails [...] that has yet been experienced in this country.' Using extensive research, non-fiction narrative, informed speculation and dramatised events, Phyllida Scrivens pays tribute to the 28 men, women and children who died, revealing the personal stories behind the names, hitherto only recorded as a list.

In the 1850s, proper young ladies were supposed to keep their feet on the ground (literally and metaphorically), but Mary dreamed of flying. Luckily, she married Carl Myers, a balloon enthusiast whose dreams were just as lofty as hers. Together, they designed and constructed balloons of all shapes and sizes, a difficult and dangerous job that required knowledge of chemistry, engineering, and meteorology. But how could they know which balloon designs worked best? They needed someone adventurous who could do balloon tricks for crowds while recording flight data. Mary knew just the person . . . herself! She gave herself the stage name Carlotta and anxiously awaited her first flight. Would she make it into the air? Could she collect the data they needed? Mary battled thick clouds and bone-chilling cold, but she went higher and farther than she hoped, and returned ready for her next flight. "

It explains how these lines transformed the rural countryside and supercharged the growth of the agricultural and small-mill communities of Dutchess County during the last half of the nineteenth century and throughout most of the twentieth century. The story includes a group of hardscrabble pioneers who struggled to establish their own rail networks. It relates the innovations in design and construction that made these lines possible and the challenges posed to their success by accidents, bad weather, and bad luck. After World War II, new modes of transportation and the growth of suburbia lead to the decline and eventual abandonment of many of these rail lines. However, a group of dedicated local historians and citizens banded together to make sure that this history was preserved, including the restoration of the historic depot at Hopewell Junction, listed as a historic and architectural resource on the New York State Register of Historical Places in 2020 and on the National Register of Historic Places in 2021.

                "In 2006, IndiGo was one of the late entrants into the low-cost airline business in India. The market already had many strong players by then-several of them new-including Captain Gopinath's Air Deccan, Ajay Singh's SpiceJet, Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines and Wadia Group's GoAir. In the next seventeen years, while some struggled and others were grounded, IndiGo became not only the largest airline in the country, but also the most valuable in the history of Indian aviation. No other Indian airline has come close to matching these numbers since Indian aviation took off in 1932 with J.R.D. Tata's Air India.  What does IndiGo do differently-and right? What makes it prosper in a troubled and often loss-riddled industry? Why has IndiGo continued to grow despite the rift in the nearly twenty- five-year-long friendship of its promoters Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal? What is the road ahead for IndiGo as it defends its supremacy in Indian aviation from Tata and Singapore Airlines-backed Air India?  In Sky High, award-winning journalist Tarun Shukla presents a detailed account of how one dream, two media-shy friends and some great execution created an aviation behemoth. Based on years of research, extensive interviews and authoritative data, this is a fascinating story of patience, planning and persistence. "

                "While airlines have been looking into the next generation of retailing practices for several years, developments since the beginning of 2020 have accelerated the need to take retailing to a new paradigm. A singular focus now is the ever-changing demands of the current and next generation of customers and employees and managing their values. Examples of customer needs include a mobile-first approach, rich content, augmented and personalized end-to-end services with seamless, consistent, and contextualized experiences. While these concepts of retailing are not new, the challenge has been in bringing them to reality due to (a) the constraints of legacy systems and processes while transitioning to next-generation retailing systems, (b) the inaccessibility of real-time data coming from a wide variety of sources such as online shopping, social media, and operations, (c) the inability to monitor real-time behavior of customers and employees, (d) the lack of effective collaboration and cooperation within the travel ecosystem, and (e) the increasing lack of trust on the part of customers.  This book provides a framework and technologies to convert retailing concepts\u2014from shopping to fulfillment\u2014into reality by (a) renovating an airline's core and ancillary products, (b) progressing faster on digital and organizational transformation journeys to make better data-based decisions about retailing, (c) getting better at managing customer value by knowing who the customers are, (d) empowering, supporting, and listening to employees to meet their expectations, (e) asking the right questions to solve complex retailing problems relating to customers, competitors, and stakeholders, and (f) questioning common-held beliefs about the airline business.  This book is indispensable for all airline executives and senior managers, as well as airline and airport commercial managers. It will also be enormously beneficial for retailers dealing with airlines and airports. "

                "Unprecedented social changes, accelerated by facilitating technologies and the COVID-19 pandemic, are calling for airlines to think deeply and non-conventionally on what will be important to existing and new travelers, as they change their lifestyles. New thinking requires airlines to extend the boundaries of their businesses to go beyond their traditional domains. This need goes beyond the renovation and iteration of conventional products to the transformation of products requiring new ideas and ways to scale them. Examples include the development of cost-effective urban air mobility, intermodal passenger transportation, door-to-door travel that is sustainable, and personalized offers.   Airimagination: Extending the Airline Business Boundaries raises some thought-provoking questions and provides a direction for practical solutions. For example, what if airlines developed products and services that finally meet end-to-end needs of customers seamlessly by collaborating in the value-adding open ecosystems, using platforms that facilitate effective engagement with both \"digital and nondigital\" customers and employees in real time and at each touch point? Ironically, the current time is an advantage for some airlines as they already have had to deal with a deep and wide disruption caused by the pandemic, leading operations to start from ground zero.   This book, the latest in a long and well-regarded series by Nawal K. Taneja, explores innovative best practices within the airline business world, complemented by numerous insightful perspectives contained in multiple forewords and thought leadership pieces. This book is aimed primarily at high-level practitioners within the airline industry and related businesses. "

                "The Motorcycle Industry in New York State  is the first book to focus on the over 120-year history of motorcycle construction in the Empire State. Beginning with experimental motorized bicycles in the 1890s, New York's motorcycle industry experienced its golden years for innovation and production in the 1900s and 1910s. From that promising start, the state's motorcycle industry declined, when the public adopted automobiles for everyday transportation. However, since the late twentieth century, the rise of custom, one-of-a-kind motorcycles has brought a new focus toward the industry. Also, a new effort to reach mass production comes in the form of e-motorcycles and e-bicycles that are being designed in New York. The first edition, published in 2001, was the product of nine years of research by New York State Museum (NYSM) curator Geoffrey N. Stein. This second edition has been revised and updated by NYSM Senior Historian and Curator Brad L. Utter. For anyone who loves motorcycles or for those enthusiasts/collectors that wish to know more about these unique makers and the bikes that they created,  The Motorcycle Industry in New York State  is the ideal companion.

As mishaps and disasters proliferated, a dedicated service of lifesavers arose. Braving perilous conditions, these servicemen pulled those aboard the merchant schooner  Havanna  from certain death. The intrepid St Joseph Lifesavers saved the crew and passengers of the  City of Duluth . Sadly, not all rescues ended in heroism, as was the case with the doomed Arab that went down along with two other ships.    Author Michael Passwater captures the stories of shipwrecks and the brave men and women that risked their lives against an angry Lake Michigan. "

                "A celebration of trucks and trucking, from the first motorised wagons to the advent of driverless freight vehicles.  Charting decade after decade of innovation and change,  The Truck Book  is a beautifully illustrated history of trucks, trucking culture, and the romance of the open road. Trucks, lorries, and vans share their origins in the steam wagons of the late 1800s and the invention of the modern combustion engine in the 1870s. As steam power gave way to petrol and diesel engines, trucks evolved and diversified according to their desired purpose - becoming everything from panel vans and pick-up trucks to heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) or construction trucks like log carriers or concrete transporters. They have played a defining role in the wars of the last 100 years, saved lives as ambulances and fire engines, and even provided entertainment in the form of monster trucks.  In this book, you will find:   -Chapters showcasing every era's most important and iconic marques and models - from the Ford TT to the Bedford TM Turbo 92 Series to the Toyota Hilux. -Information about trucking culture, showing how trucks or trucking companies, such as UPS or Eddie Stobart, have won a place in fans' hearts. -Gallery pages providing a historical and global overview of key vehicles, from micro vans and pickups to American big rigs and earthmovers Weaving together photographic catalogues with specially commissioned \"visual tours\", feature pages on truck models, designers, and manufacturers, and milestone events or technological developments over the last 120 years,  The Truck Book  is the best-illustrated title available.

                "What we see through our windshields reflects ideas about our national identity, consumerism, and infrastructure.   For better or worse, windshields have become a major frame for viewing the nonhuman world. The view from the road is one of the main ways in which we experience our environments. These vistas are the result of deliberate historical forces, and humans have shaped them as they simultaneously sought to be transformed by them. In  Consuming Landscapes , Thomas Zeller explores how what we see while driving reflects how we view our societies and ourselves, the role that consumerism plays in our infrastructure, and ideas about reshaping the environment in the twentieth century.  Zeller breaks new ground by comparing the driving experience and the history of landscaped roads in the United States and Germany, two major automotive countries. He focuses specifically on the Blue Ridge Parkway in the United States and the German Alpine Road as case studies. When the automobile was still young, an early twentieth-century group of designers\u2014landscape architects, civil engineers, and planners\u2014sought to build scenic infrastructures, or roads that would immerse drivers in the landscapes that they were traversing. As more Americans and Europeans owned cars and drove them, however, they became less interested in enchanted views; safety became more important than beauty.   Clashes between designers and drivers resulted in different visions of landscapes made for automobiles. As strange as it may seem to twenty-first-century readers, many professionals in the early twentieth century envisioned cars and roads, if properly managed, as saviors of the environment.  Consuming Landscapes  illustrates how the meaning of infrastructures changed as a result of use and consumption. Such changes indicate a deep ambivalence toward the automobile and roads, prompting the question: can cars and roads bring us closer to nature while deeply altering it at the same time?. "

                "A fully illustrated new assessment of the German tank force that won its greatest victory in France during 1940.     The German conquest of France in 1940 was arguably the Wehrmacht's greatest military achievement, conquering France in several weeks after having failed to do so in World War I. New Panzer tactics, dubbed 'Blitzkrieg', were at the heart of the German victory. In this book, renowned armor expert Steven J. Zaloga reassesses the armored force that made the triumph possible, and explains that although the German Panzers won their reputation in France, they were far from being a technological juggernaut. The vast majority were the small PzKpfw I and PzKpfw II light tanks. The more effective medium tanks such as the PzKpfw III and PzKpfw IV were available in relatively small numbers. Their effectiveness had far more to do with training and doctrine than technology.  With illustrations including unpublished photos and superb new artwork, this book examines the wide range of German tanks employed in France in 1940, as well as their organization and tactical doctrine.

By the time of the outbreak of the World War II, they were approaching obsolescence, as tank forces in Europe were shifting from light to medium tanks as the main element of their armored forces. First entering combat in the autumn of 1941 in the Western Desert with the British Army, the Stuart quickly proved its inadequacies. The M3 and M5 light tanks proved more suitable in the Pacific theater than in Europe, and fought successfully in many of the major battles including Guadalcanal, Tarawa and Peleliu. This title narrates this distinctive and unusual fighting vehicle's history. "

                "How the introduction of steam, iron, and steel required new rules and new ways of thinking for the design and building of ships.  In the 1800s, shipbuilding moved from sail and wood to steam, iron, and steel. The competitive pressure to achieve more predictable ocean transportation drove the industrialization of shipbuilding, as shipowners demanded ships that enabled tighter scheduling, improved performance, and safe delivery of cargoes. In  Bridging the Seas , naval historian Larrie Ferreiro describes this transformation of shipbuilding, portraying the rise of a professionalized naval architecture as an integral part of the Industrial Age.   Picking up where his earlier book,  Ships and Science , left off, Ferreiro explains that the introduction of steam, iron, and steel required new rules and new ways of thinking for designing and building ships. The characteristics of performance had to be first measured, then theorized. Ship theory led to the development of quantifiable standards that would ensure the safety and quality required by industry and governments, and this in turn led to the professionalization of naval architecture as an engineering discipline. Ferreiro describes, among other things, the technologies that allowed greater predictability in ship performance; theoretical developments in naval architecture regarding motion, speed and power, propellers, maneuvering, and structural design; the integration of theory into ship design and construction; and the emergence of a laboratory infrastructure for research.

Focusing on the technology of the period, author Steven J. Zaloga explains how the demands of a potential Cold War battlefield spurred the development of the 20th century's most advanced tanks. He considers the final versions of the Soviet T-72, T-64, and T-80 and assesses their strengths and weaknesses. He also explores how the failure of the US-German MBT-70 project led to America's development of the M1 Abrams tank, and to Germany's all-new Leopard II. The British development of the Challenger tank is also considered, as is the lesser-known Leclerc tank developed by France, the smallest and lightest of any of the western designs.   Featuring superbly detailed new illustrations and many photos, this volume pinpoints the key technology of the era, including turbine engines, APFSDS ammunition, advanced armor and high-tech fire-control systems, and describes how the rival tanks compared in the final stretch of the Cold War arms race.

                "This book provides a flight plan for riding the impending connectivity transformation curve. It takes the perspective of actionability, highlighting initiatives that executives in airlines and related businesses can use from the insights of multi-industry executives. The emphasis is on execution, not on the concepts themselves.  There is a cluster of at least four distinct megatrends that may converge to form disruptive conditions: (1) elevated expectations of existing and new customer segmentations, those who expect available and accessible air mass transportation systems, and those who expect connected services and seamless travel on different modes of transportation; (2) new emerging technology, incorporated in the air and ground vehicles, that will create new opportunities for existing and new service providers to offer new value propositions; (3) platforms developed around the ecosystem of customers; and (4) the impact on travel that the fast-changing demographic and economic characteristics of two major countries: India and China. These megatrends could lead existing or new businesses to create value propositions specifically dedicated to the new segments once each reaches a critical mass. Drawing on the author's own experience in the airline industry and related businesses, this book discusses the \"how\", relating to reimagining the business, re-entrepreneuring the organization, innovating through partnerships, reengaging with customers and employees, and rebranding the business in response to these trends.   This book is recommended reading for all senior-level practitioners of airlines and related businesses worldwide. "

Sudden violent storms and rocky shoals have claimed the lives of countless mortals foolish enough to brave the treacherous surf of Lake Michigan. But is there another, unnatural force at work? A force that spirited away a ship's captain from a locked cabin without a trace? A force that caused a perfectly airworthy jet to fly into the waves, taking all its passengers to a watery death? Perhaps these tragedies are linked to numerous UFO sightings over the lake. Or perhaps a clue might be found in the prehistoric Stonehenge-like structures discovered deep beneath the crystalline blue surface.    Historian and storyteller Gayle Soucek will explore the mysteries behind the area known as the Lake Michigan Triangle. "

After World War II, French troops were equipped with a motley collection of American and cast-off British equipment until the outbreak of war in Korea saw an increase in military aid. This included large numbers of the M24 Chaffee light tank, along with amphibious vehicles such as the M29C Weasel and LVT4 Buffalo, to conduct operations in coastal and inland areas that the Viet Minh had previously thought immune to attack. France's armour was a key part of the battle against the Viet Minh right up until the last stand at Dien Bien Phu. "

The \u2018Old Grey Lady\u2019, the \u2018Growler\u2019, \u201820,000 rivets in loose formation\u2019, but mostly known simply as the \u2018Shack\u2019, it is viewed with great affection by those who flew and maintained it. In addition to its traditional sub-hunting role, it was also used extensively for search and rescue operations, and even as a conventional bomber in the Aden theatre. Operating around the world with squadrons based in the UK, the Mediterranean, Middle East and Far East, \u2018Shacks\u2019 were also used to support the blockade of oil supplies to Rhodesia during the UDI crisis in the \u201960s and \u201970s, and searching for gun-running boats during the Indonesian Confrontation. All of the Boys\u2019 stories are from air and ground crew veterans themselves, and because there are so many vital and entertaining accounts, Steve Bond has divided his subject into two volumes. Consequently this volume will cover UK-based units flying from Ballykelly (including Aldergrove), Farnborough, Honington, Kinloss, Lossiemouth, St Eval and St Mawgan, plus many overseas detachments including Christmas Island and Majunga. To complement the detailed personal accounts and anecdotes are hundreds of original photographs and extensive appendices. A feast for any \u2018Shack\u2019 or military aviation aficionado. Volume Two (coming in 2019) will cover those units based overseas at Changi, Gan, Gibraltar, Khormaksar, Luqa (and Hal Far), and Sharjah, plus the South African Air Force operations from Ysterplaat/Malan.

                "This brilliant and eye-opening look at the new phenomenon called the aerotropolis gives us a glimpse of the way we will live in the near future\u2014and the way we will do business too.  Not so long ago, airports were built near cities, and roads connected the one to the other. This pattern\u2014the city in the center, the airport on the periphery\u2014 shaped life in the twentieth century, from the central city to exurban sprawl. Today, the ubiquity of jet travel, round-the-clock workdays, overnight shipping, and global business networks has turned the pattern inside out. Soon the airport will be at the center and the city will be built around it, the better to keep workers, suppliers, executives, and goods in touch with the global market.  This is the aerotropolis: a combination of giant airport, planned city, shipping facility, and business hub. The aerotropolis approach to urban living is now reshaping life in Seoul and Amsterdam, in China and India, in Dallas and Washington, D.C. The aerotropolis is the frontier of the next phase of globalization, whether we like it or not.  John D. Kasarda defined the term \"aerotropolis,\" and he is now sought after worldwide as an adviser. Working with Kasarda's ideas and research, the gifted journalist Greg Lindsay gives us a vivid, at times disquieting look at these instant cities in the making, the challenges they present to our environment and our usual ways of life, and the opportunities they offer to those who can exploit them creatively.  Aerotropolis  is news from the near future\u2014news we urgently need if we are to understand the changing world and our place in it. "

Some - like the Darjeeling Himalayan - are well known, but others - like the Zhob Valley, Khyber Pass and Kangra Valley lines - are less so. Several of these railways were also the last bastions of steam operation in the sub-continent. Unsurprisingly, as hill railways, most of them reached remarkable heights, many using ingenious feats of engineering to assist their climb into seemingly impenetrable terrain. These lines served diverse locations, each with its own characteristics, from the hostile territories of the North-West Frontier, along the spectacular foothills of the Himalayas, skirting the Western Ghats of the Deccan down to the gentle rolling landscape of the Nilgiris, or Blue Hills, of South India. The book gives the histories of the seven hill railways including summaries of their operations and routes. Maps and gradient charts for all seven railway lines are given as well as listings of the locomotives operating the hill railways. "

                "The 1990s brought with it many important developments for the aviation world. The dissolution of the USSR and Yugoslavia led to a rise of new countries and airlines. The aircraft faced changes as well. The early jetliners found themselves hauling cargo in many cases, and the new wide-bodies became the normal mode of passenger transport for long-haul travel, along with the creation of a whole new generation of types for short-haul. However, in parts of the world the old piston-powered props could be found plodding on, albeit in declining numbers. With over 300 color photographs and extended, informative captions, this book reflects the many ways in which the air transport industry changed during the decade. Taking the reader on a visual journey across the globe, this book explores some of the most popular airliners of the time, including Boeing, Airbus, and McDonnell Douglas, and how their aircraft developed throughout the decade.

                "Unusually for a large class of locomotives, all Western Class locomotives had the same prefix which gave them a unique identity. Redesignated as Class 52 in the early 1970s, they were essentially designed by and for the Western Region, which saw hydraulic transmission as the way forward in replacing the 4-6-0 steam locomotives that Swindon had produced. However, the rest of British Rail went down the road of electric transmission as the mistakes of the wholesale lunge into dieselization came to fruition, and when BR opted for a standard policy the Western Region was forced to comply. It was in 1967 that the death warrant for the hydraulics was signed, though it would take more than a decade to finally end the hydraulic era. Illustrated with full-color photographs of all 74 of the Western Class locomotives, on a variety of workings that illustrate their versatility, this nostalgic volume gives a portrait of a much-loved, but short-lived, class of locomotive.

                "With specially commissioned artworks and dynamic combat ribbon diagrams, this volume reveals how the 'last of the gunfighters', as the F-8 was dubbed by its pilots, prevailed against the growing MiG threat of the Vietnamese People's Air Force .     When the Vietnam War began, the F-8 was already firmly established as a fighter and reconnaissance aircraft. It entered combat as an escort for Alpha strike packages, braving the anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles alongside the A-4 Skyhawk bombers and meeting MiGs for the first time on 3 April 1965. Although the Crusader was nicknamed 'last of the gunfighters', its pilots employed 'secondary' AIM-9D Sidewinder missiles in all but one of their MiG kills, with guns also used as back-up in three. Its 20 mm guns were unreliable as they often jammed during strenuous manoeuvres, although they were responsible for damaging a number of MiGs. However, in combat the F-8 had the highest 'exchange ratio' (kills divided by losses) at six-to-one of any US combat aircraft involved in the Vietnam War.   Through the copious use of first-hand accounts, highly detailed battlescene artwork, combat ribbon diagrams and armament views, Osprey's Vietnam air war specialist Peter E. Davies charts the successful career of the F-8 Crusader over Vietnam. "

'Jack' Northrop was already developing prototypes of a large 'flying wing' strategic bomber, which would have been the most radical bombers of their age.    World War II brought a need for very long-range bombers and Northrop received a contract for a 172-ft span bomber, the B-35. Several of these were built, gradually evolving into the definitive XB-35 configuration. Testing revealed that the aircraft was invisible to radar, but engineers struggled to overcome the design challenges and several pilots were lost in crashes. While the program was cancelled in the 1950s, the concept extended into other highly innovative areas, such as the XP-56 and MX-324 Rocket Wing prototype fighters. But the greatest legacy was the first operational flying wing \u2013 the Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber, which used much of the hard-won experience from the pioneering programs of half a century before.

                "Germany, divided after World War II into two separate countries, was reunified on October 3, 1990. For the country\u2019s rail system, the complex task of unifying two networks with very different rolling stock and systems had just begun. New lines and stations were built to physically unite the network and new trains were introduced to transform services. Many rural regional lines closed as car ownership in the former East Germany increased dramatically. Amazingly, however, none of the former East German narrow-gauge lines that were still steam-operated in 1990 have shut; most still offer daily services while other long-closed narrow-gauge lines have been rebuilt and reopened by enthusiast groups. This book, written by the Modern Railways magazine\u2019s Europe Editor and illustrated with over 130 pictures, most of which have never been published before, traces the development of the unified German rail network and new national operator Deutsche Bahn (DB AG). It also looks at the wider rail industry in Germany and the introduction of market reforms leading to one of the most dynamic rail markets anywhere, with over 300 rail freight operators, open access intercity competition and more than 100 regional passenger concession contracts replacing the original two state railway companies. Looking to the future, the book examines plans for new high-speed lines and a national regular-interval timetable from 2030. "

Following a redesign, the Series II Land Rover was launched in April 1958. It was available in two wheelbases, with a choice of diesel or petrol engines and a variety of body styles including pick-ups and soft-tops and, aimed more at travel and people-carrying rather than agricultural work, short and long wheelbase Station Wagons. The main difference that identified the new Land Rovers at a glance was the radius pressed into the aluminium bodywork below the galvanized waist rail. This changed the Land Rover's appearance considerably and was a shape that endured until 2016 in the Land Rover Defender. The Series IIA was introduced in 1961 and through a production run that last until 1971, a succession of upgrades, mainly detail and cosmetic changes, followed. The distinctive Station Wagon models \u2013 unofficially referred to as 'Safari' models \u2013 became popular with overland travelers and were often seen on location in TV nature programs, in National Geographic magazine and in the hands of aid agencies all of which promoted the Land Rover, which had most of the market to itself, especially in export markets such as Australasia and Africa.

This, his latest colour album, covers the railways of Scotland in steam days and concentrates as much as possible on depicting older types of locomotives. Consequently, this volume contains a large amount of rare 1950s colour images, often depicting areas of the Scottish railway system that were later closed or cut back during the Beeching era. The pictures in this book, were taken by enthusiasts who had the good fortune to be able to afford colour film, at a time when such luxuries, were very expensive, to the average enthusiast. All the photographers concerned, travelled far and wide in Scotland with their cameras, at a time, just before most of the lines closed, between 1953\u20131967. The result of all this effort, is a fine collection of very rare images, depicting a lost period of railway operation, in a beautiful and picturesque part of Britain. "

                "At the beginning of the last century it was possible to sail from London to Glasgow via the south coast ports and Belfast, returning along the east coast from either Dundee or Leith for as little as five pounds. Those were the days when 300 passengers were landed twice weekly at Grangemouth or Dundee from the London boat, and the coastal passenger and cargo liner was in its heyday, catering both for the first class tourist as well as offering keenly priced second class fares for the like of football fans following away matches. Sadly, these wonderful steamer services are now largely forgotten but this new book will stir fond memories of the ships and their coastal voyages. The Depression of the 1930s, coupled with competition from both railway and the motor coach, were to spell the end for many of the coastal liners, while heavy losses incurred in World War II left only a few ships each offering just a handful of passenger berths. The story of their one hundred years of service is accompanied by numerous fascinating anecdotes, and the book focuses as much on the social need for coastal passenger services, the men and women who provided the services and the passengers who used them, as it does on the nuts and bolts of the ships themselves. This beautifully presented book will delight both ship enthusiasts and all those who enjoy the maritime and social history of the British Isles. "

Most importantly, the previously unpublished views in this book are the work of one man, Blake Paterson, a professional railwayman, who was also an outstanding photographer who some forty-five years ago was determined to record as much of the passing railway scene as possible. He set himself demanding schedules and would often travel vast distances, sometimes using overnight trains, to reach the more remote comers of the rail network.During this intense period of photographic activity, when he took thousands of colour slides, he followed his own strict rules. He would normally only take a photograph when the sun was shining and he would try to capture the train in its natural setting. For Blake, ambiance was paramount.This book is a unique record of one man's railway portraits, featuring a wealth of locations, steam and diesel locomotives, DMUs, stations and station buildings, halts, signals, gas lamps, infrastructure, staff and passengers. Anything that was set to vanish, Blake felt should be recorded. His photographs provide a perfect pictorial record of so many of the lost splendours of Britains rail network. "

                "In the late nineteenth century, circus aerialists collaborated with show balloonists to perform death-defying stunts, initially by suspending themselves from trapeze bars beneath a balloon, later by jumping from the balloons using fabric parachutes. By the 1890s, these performances became a worldwide craze, remaining in rural fairs and fetes for decades. Many of the original balloon-parachute pioneers went on to play key roles in the creation of airships, test flying the first gliders and airplanes. Based on extensive historical research, this unusual account explores how a nineteenth-century daredevil act united with the desire to achieve human flight. These performers' contributions did not come without a price: dozens, if not hundreds, of people died in horrifying events witnessed by thousands of spectators. This book chronicles the act that had no practical purpose other than entertainment, which eventually evolved into the development of the free-fall parachute pack\u2014a key aviation need\u2014and the foundation of a new activity known as skydiving.

                "Blast down the quarter mile in the first two generations of Ford's legendary pony car across all drag racing classes in  Quarter-Mile Mustangs!  Since first becoming a mass-market success in mid-1964, the Ford Mustang has made millions of passes down the quarter mile on sanctioned drag strips. With styling flared toward the youth, aftermarket parts manufacturers saw an enormous opportunity to produce go-fast components to aid in propelling Ford's pony car down the 1320. The success of these cars was immediate.  In the hands of successful and seasoned pros, such as Gas Ronda, Bill Lawton, and Dick Brannan, Ford unleashed the devastatingly potent 1965 A/FX Mustang fastback, which was built by Blue Oval stalwarts Holman & Moody with the 427 SOHC (Cammer) engine that unleashed havoc on mother Mopar.  From those very first factory drag cars through the fabled 1968-1/2 Cobra Jets, drag racing historian Doug Boyce highlights the many successes of pioneers, such as \"Dyno\" Don Nicholson, Les Ritchey, Phil Bonner, Hubert Platt, and Al Joniec. However, it's not just all doorslammers. As A/FX transitioned into Funny Car, a whole new chapter in Mustang drag racing was written with Mickey Thompson taking the reins and steering Mustangs to success throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.   The muscle car-era Mustangs joined the Mustang II and soldiered on the best they could as ever-changing rules hampered Ford's new pony body, with drivers Bob Glidden and Nicholson trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of the diminutive pony.   Quarter-Mile Mustangs: The History of Ford's Pony Car at the Drag Strip 1964-1/2-1978  brings forth the most in-depth coverage of these cars at the drag strip. Don't get caught sleeping at the light!. "

                "With safety protocols in their infancy and the jet engine still in development, early commercial flight above American cities was too often deadly. Between December 1951 and January 1952, three separate plane crashes barreled down onto Elizabeth, New Jersey. Many dozens perished as the crashes destroyed entire city blocks and wreaked havoc throughout various neighborhoods. Frightened residents turned to the nearby Newark Airport for blame as a groundswell of political pushback occurred in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to stop the airport's expansion. President Truman formed an airport safety commission in response that recommended better zoning around airports and runways. Author Peter Zablocki tells the harrowing story of one of the most unique and tragic series of plane crashes in the nation's history. "

A well-researched and presented tome.\" \u2014 Key Model World   For generations of railway enthusiasts and more lately for social historians, the life and times of the former Great Central Railway and in particular its extension towards London in the 1890s and closure seventy years later, have generated considerable interest and controversy. Although many books have been written about the Railway, the majority in recent times have concentrated upon providing a photographic record and a nostalgic look in retrospect to what was generally perceived as happier times for the route. None of the books have presented the outcome from thorough research into the business aspects of the Railway and its successive private (LNER) and public (BR) ownerships through war and peace, and times of industrial, social and political change, that influenced and shaped the demand for a railway service. While retaining a strong railway theme throughout, the book identifies the role played by successive governments, the electricity and coal industries and the effect of social change that, together resulted in a case for closure. The content of the book replaces much supposition with fact and places on record what really happened. The final part of the book acknowledges the fine work over half a century of volunteers dedicated to saving a section of the line in Leicestershire.  \"A valuable addition to the social and political history of railways.\" \u2014The Railway Correspondence and Travel Society.

                "Using first-hand accounts and brand-new artwork, this book brings to life the realities of flying the Bf 109 in combat during the very first battles of World War II.     The Bf 109 was one of the principal fighter aircraft types in the Luftwaffe's inventory during the opening months of World War II and it was central to many of Germany's early victories, before coming up against the unbeatable RAF during the Battle of Britain. This book presents first-hand experiences of the pilots who flew the Bf 109E, the aircraft which first featured a Daimler-Benz DB 601 powerplant, and which was in the front line in the skies over Poland, the Low Countries and France, and the older Bf 109D, still in use in the Polish campaign. The early variants of the Messerschmitt fighter, the Bf 109E-1, Bf 109E-2 and Bf 109E-3, swept all before them during the opening wartime campaigns, their successes only fading at the Battle of France, when the Bf 109's seasoned pilots encountered modern and well-flown RAF and Arm\u00e9e de l'Air fighters. In a rigorous and engaging new analysis, Luftwaffe aviation expert Malcolm V. Lowe examines and assesses the Bf 109 as a fighting machine from the perspective of the Luftwaffe at the forefront of the German blitzkrieg. Contemporary photographs and specially commissioned artwork, including a dramatic battlescene, armament views, technical diagrams and ribbon diagrams illustrating step-by-step each battle tactic of the main dogfights explored in the book, bring the experiences of the Bf 109 pilots vividly to life.

                "There is barely a corner of the five great oceans where Clyde-built is not recognised as the ultimate shipbuilding accolade. As late as the 1950s, around a seventh of the total of the world's sea going tonnage was built on the Clyde. It is not a particularly wide river, nor spectacularly long \u2013 it is certainly no Mississippi or Amazon \u2013 but its fame is legendary. From the many yards on its banks, north and south, en route from the gentle hills of Lanarkshire to the Firth of Clyde, came engineering innovation and fabled names in shipping \u2013 iconic vessels like the Cutty Sark and the Delta Queen, fearsome warships like the mighty Hood, and the cream of the world's great liners, the Cunard Queens and the beautiful white Empress vessels. All that and cargo carrying workhorses that opened up the world. More recent times have seen the phoenix-like revival of Ferguson Shipbuilders, the last remaining yard on the Lower Clyde, saved from closure by industrialist Jim McColl and now investing in the hybrid technology of the future that has thrown a lifeline to this once great yard. This is the fascinating, often turbulent, story of a great river, its great ships and the folk who built them. "

                "Check out the first ever biography on the popular drag racer, Butch \"The California Flash\" Leal. Born and raised in central California, Larry \"Butch\" Leal was obsessed with cars from a very early age. What began with field cars turned into hard work and new Chevrolets. This took place when the golden era of drag racing was in its infancy, and Leal joined with enthusiasm. He performed well at the track with his early Chevys and had an impressive number of wins before he was out of high school. His success brought him plenty of attention and collaboration with other big names in the sport.  In 1963, GM pulled out of the sport on an official basis. As a result, Butch (at age 19) teamed up with Mickey Thompson and joined the Ford camp, securing a ride with the factory team and its new Thunderbolts for 1964. After his success that season, including winning the Super Stock (S/S) class at the 1964 NHRA US Nationals in Indianapolis, Chrysler came calling, and Butch signed on to race the new altered-wheelbase cars in match races for 1965, as the NHRA did not have a class for these new \"funny\" looking cars. While Leal dabbled again with Ford and Chevrolet later, his relationship with Chrysler lasted well into the following decades, running both Funny Cars and Super Stockers.  Penned by talented automotive historian Bob McClurg, who was there for it all, and featuring full collaboration with the book's subject, Butch \"The California Flash\" Leal covers the span of his fascinating career during arguably the most interesting era in drag racing history. Butch was an 11-time NHRA champion and 4-time recipient of Car Craft Magazine's All-Star Driver of the Year award in a career that spanned the 1960s through the 1990s. It's all here, the events, great vintage photography, and the stories from one of the best storytellers the NHRA has ever known. Add this entertaining volume to your drag racing library today. "

                "Scotland has a worldwide reputation for launching some of the greatest ships ever built, but far less is known about our pioneering work on aviation. Yet in the great industrial cities and remote islands across the country, men and women risked their reputations, resources and lives to advance experiments in flight. Before airliners crossed the Atlantic Ocean and bombers secretly flew into the NATO airbase at Machrihanish, pioneers of aviation worked in the unlikely surroundings of Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow among other places. Their humble flying crafts, made with wood and canvas, would become the luxurious jet-engined aircraft of today.  Including the first flight over Everest, the construction of the most northerly airship station in mainland Britain and the experience of civilians and pilots during the Clydebank Blitz of 1941, Scotland's Wings is a glimpse into the dramatic and sometimes controversial adventures within Scottish aeronautics.  In  Scotland's Wings , Robert Jeffrey tells a fascinating history, highlighting innovators whose ideas heralded the   modern age of transport and revealing how the airfields of previous years will once again be used to progress into   a daring new age of travel.

                "\u201cReaders with an interest in the early days of organized civil mass air transport will enjoy having a familiar story be retold from a Greek perspective.\u201d \u2014  SpeedReaders   \u00a0  The Olympic Airways story has fascinated Graham M. Simons for many years. This new book represents the culmination of decades spent researching the history of this fascinating Greek airline. It is a story of evolution, conflict, personality and politics, all set against a backdrop of world and civil wars, coups and countercoups.  \u00a0  During the course of his research, it became apparent to the author that many of the fine details pertaining to the company weren\u2019t widely known, although almost everyone had heard of the towering, controversial, leading figurehead who oversaw much of the central part of the story: Aristotle Socrates Onassis. His colorful life is threaded through this history, lending it drama and multiple levels of intrigue.  \u00a0  The airline\u2019s story cannot be told in isolation. Olympic did not spring fully formed into being in 1957. The named company may have come into being then, but its roots were set much further back in history through a number of predecessor airlines\u2014both national and international\u2014who had been using the Hellenic Republic and Ath\u00edna as the crossroads of the air for the Eastern Mediterranean since the dawn of aviation.  \u00a0  This is the story of the birth and dramatic life of an airline with a checkered, controversial and complicated history. Graham M. Simons has skillfully woven all the various threads to create a powerful and important historic record. "

By the end of the 19th century, she led the world in lighter-than-air flight. Any concern about heavier-than-air flight was dismissed as inevitable, and France would achieve it in due course.  \u00a0  France was also the first nation to stage air exhibitions. Unlike their counterparts in Britain, Germany and America, French designers were thoroughly entrepreneurial and tried a wide variety of adventurous styles from pusher to canard and monoplane to multiplane. In 1909 the first Air Show was held at the Grand Palais in what was to become an enduring tradition. Every year, the aircraft exhibitions were a massive success.  \u00a0  It is not surprising that all this derring-do, all these technological achievements and all this innovation drew reporters and photographers like moths to a flame. The men, the machines, the places and the events all were recorded, reported, reproduced and then were filed away. Hundreds of images appeared in print, but thousands were printed up only as contact prints from large-format glass negatives and then disappeared into albums to be forgotten about. In the mid-1990s the author came across one such treasure-trove; a number of dust-covered albums containing around five hundred images of aircraft, airships and expositions\u2014it is doubtful if most have appeared in print before, so this will probably be the first time the events of these French pioneers have ever been showcased.

Running complimentary to, and in some places, in combination with, London Underground, it carries more than 180 million passengers a year on 9 lines and serves 112 stations over a combined length of more than 100 miles. An amalgamation of several commuter lines (and one London Underground Line) that ring London it now branches out to all points of the compass. Over recent years it's also undergone unprecedented change and investment (with a few troubles along the way) with the phasing out of old and the introduction of new rolling stock. This book takes a photographic look at these changes including a look at the routes, the stations and the trains including Classes 172, 315, 317, 378 and the brand new 710s with a brief history of each. And with so much freight sharing the Overground routes this is briefly looked at as well. "

                "\u201cA first-rate review of the history of the world's first commercial jetliner, its early difficulties and their rectification\u201d (  Firetrench).   The world got a little smaller in July 1949 when the first jet-powered airliner took to the skies barely four years after the end of the Second World War.  Not only was the de Havilland Comet 1 was a lot faster than previous airliners, but it could also fly higher and further. It was packed with new technology but, perhaps most importantly for those early passengers, it was a quiet, luxurious, and even pleasant experience, something that could never be said for the noisy piston-engine aircraft that came before.  The Comet\u2019s leadership in jet travel for the future was assured until aircraft began crashing. The first ones were put down to pilot error but two disastrous events in 1954 grounded the fleet and Britain\u2019s advantage over the rest of the world was lost. Boeing caught up with its ubiquitous 707 and the Comet was destined to become but a memory.  However, rising from the ashes came a new Comet\u2014one that was bigger and more powerful than before and designed for completely different roles. Where the first Comets had provided an expensive and plush way to travel for the rich few, the new Comet 4s carried more passengers to a multitude of destinations inevitably becoming key carriers for the early package holidaymakers. At the same time, they became vital strategic transports for the RAF as the British Empire receded.  This book tells the full story of the world\u2019s first jet-powered airliner, from its remarkable beginnings, through its early flight trials programme to its entry into service. The type\u2019s military career is also covered, as is its construction; also included in this volume are details of the numerous variants produced and those still surviving as exhibits today. "

                "This illustrated history \u201c  recounts the unusual and sometimes dramatic development and operational career of one of the twentieth century\u2019s most iconic airliners\u201d ( Aviation History Magazine ).   \u00a0  Clarence \u201cKelly\u201d Johnson\u2019s design for the Lockheed Constellation, known affectionately as the Connie, produced one of the world\u2019s most iconic airliners. Lockheed had been working on the L-044 Excalibur, a four-engine, pressurized airliner, since 1937. In 1939, Trans World Airlines, at the instigation of major stockholder Howard Hughes, requested a forty-passenger transcontinental aircraft with a range of 3,500 miles, well beyond the capabilities of the Excalibur design. TWA\u2019s requirements led to the L-049 Constellation, designed by Lockheed engineers including Kelly Johnson and Hall Hibbard.  \u00a0  Between 1943 and 1958, Lockheed built 856 Constellations in numerous models at its Burbank, California, factory\u2014all with the same distinctive and immediately recognizable triple-tail design and dolphin-shaped fuselage. The Constellation was used as a civil airliner and as a military and civilian air transport, seeing service in the Berlin and the Biafran airlifts. Three of them served as the presidential aircraft for Dwight D. Eisenhower. After World War II, TWA\u2019s transatlantic service began on February 6, 1946 with a New York-Paris flight in a Constellation. Then, on June 17, 1947, Pan Am opened the first-ever scheduled round-the-world service with their L-749 Clipper America.  \u00a0  With revealing insight into the Lockheed Constellation, the renowned aviation historian Graham M. Simons examines its design, development, and service, both military and civil. In doing so, he reveals the story of a design which, as the first pressurized airliner in widespread use, helped to usher in affordable and comfortable air travel around the world.  \u00a0  \u201cSimons makes good use of black-and-white and color photographs of Constellations in various airline markings and includes colorful airline brochures and marketing posters featuring the aircraft.\u201d \u2014 Air Power History.

                "Silicon Valley wants us to believe that technology will revolutionize our cities and the ways we move around. Autonomous vehicles will make us safer, greener, and more efficient. On-demand services like Uber and Lyft will eliminate car ownership. Micromobility devices like electric scooters will be at every corner, and drones will deliver goods and services. Meanwhile visionaries like Elon Musk promise to eliminate congestion with tunnels, and Uber help with flying cars. The future of transport is frictionless, sustainable, and according to Paris Marx, a threat to our ideas of what a society should be.  Road to Nowhere  exposes the problems with tech's visions of the future and argues that we cannot allow ourselves to be continually distracted by technological fantasies that delay the collective solutions we already know are effective. Technological solutions to social problems and the people who propose them must be challenged if we are to build cities and transportation systems which serve the public good. In response, Paris Marx offers a vision for a more collective way of organizing transportation systems which considers the needs of poor, marginalized, and vulnerable peoples. The book also argues that rethinking mobility can be the first step in a broader reimagining of how we organize our social, economic, and political systems to serve the many, not the few. "

Just before 08.40 hours, descending out of the gloom, came a large, twin-engine airplane lining up for final approach. After a flight lasting 16 hours and 28 minutes, Captain John Alcock and Lieutenant Arthur Whitten-Brown had won the race to be the first to fly nonstop across the Atlantic\u2014and the prize of \u00a310,000, roughly equivalent to $1,000,000 in today's money, offered by Lord Rothermere, aviation philanthropist and owner of the  Daily Mail .    Illustrated by many unique photographs this book tells the story of the race, delayed for almost six years by the First World War. Many aircraft would be entered but few would even get off the ground. The teams faced great difficulties in preparing for the challenge of crossing one of the most hostile stretches of ocean on Earth.    The authors not only reveal tales of failures and technical difficulties, but of the intense frustration of waiting for the perfect weather-window. And even when finally airborne, Alcock and Brown's flight almost ended in disaster on several occasions as weather conditions almost conspired to cast them down into the grey, cold waters of the Atlantic and almost certain death.    \"Right from the first page, you'll be hooked . . . you're in the cockpit with Alcock and Brown and every dump and dive of the flight across the Atlantic.\" \u2014Vintage Airfix.

In those years over two thousand of the type appeared in London, ordered by Stagecoach, First London, United, Metroline, Metrobus, London General, Blue Triangle, Connex, Armchair, and Hackney Community Transport. The body work was by Alexander ALX400, Plaxton, (Precedent) and East Lancs, to two available lengths, while badging itself progressed although Trans Bus, until this troubled organisation was suspended in 2004 by todays Alexander Dennis.

This book reviews the history of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. an iconic and important aircraft in civil aviation.\" \u2014Firetrench  On April 27 2005, an aircraft under the power of six massive Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofan engines was making its first flight, and it was making history. For this was the Airbus A380, the largest passenger aircraft in the world.  With air traffic continuing to double every fifteen years, the A380 was designed by Airbus Industrie to meet the needs of the passengers and airports, while also delivering the level of efficiency necessary to protect the environment for future generations. The design incorporated two full-length decks with wide-body dimensions, meaning its two passenger levels offered an entire deck's worth of additional space compared to the next largest twin-engine jetliner. With more seats than any other aircraft, the A380 offered solutions to overcrowding; needing fewer journeys to carry 60 percent more passengers, making it the perfect solution to airport congestion, fleet planning optimization and traffic growth. Typical seating capacity was 525, although the aircraft was certified to carry up to 853 passengers.  Production of the A380 peaked at thirty aircraft per year in 2012 and 2014. Then, in February 2019, the biggest customer, Emirates, announced that it was to reduce its latest order by thirty-nine aircraft in favour of two other Airbus Models, the A350 and A330neo, a version using the same engines as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. For Airbus, it was the last act. The Company announced that production of the A380 would cease by 2021.  \"Full of great information.\" \u2014 Airport Spotting. "

                "A journey into the golden age of naval history, when these floating powerhouses ruled the waves.   \u00a0  The battleship was the ultimate embodiment of naval power during the latter stages of the British Empire, with the Royal Navy the first to build the dreadnought battleship in 1906. The new design, with a uniform main battery and steam turbines making it faster and more accurate than ever before, sparked a race with the German navy that culminated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, the only fleet-to-fleet naval battle during the First World War. With major losses on both sides, and several treaties during the interwar years banning the construction of new battleships, a new generation emerged only in the Second World War, with Japan secretly creating  Yamato  and  Musashi , two of the most powerful battleships ever built.  \u00a0  World War II saw the zenith of the battleship, with many pivotal battles such as that of Denmark Strait, during which the iconic battleship HMS  Hood  was sunk; the second battle of Guadalcanal; and the Battle of Leyte Gulf\u2014to name but a few. The Germans, the Japanese, the Royal Navy, and the US Navy were locked in a titanic struggle across vast distances, in which battleships, for a time, played a decisive role, until the development of new aircraft carriers and the growing use of torpedoes began to make them obsolete. Since the 1990s, no battleship has seen active service.  \u00a0  This accessible short history gives an expert overview of the history of the battleship, looking at its origins, the role played by battleships in both World Wars, famous ships and their stories, and the weaponry and technology they employed.

                "The history of the Schneider Trophy is the history of aircraft development. When Jacques Schneider devised and inaugurated the Coupe d'Aviation Maritime race for seaplanes in 1913, no-one could have predicted the profound effect the Series would have on aircraft design and aeronautical development, not to mention world history. Howard Pixton's 1914 victory in a Sopwith Tabloid biplane surprisingly surpassed the performance of monoplanes and other manufacturers turned back to biplanes. During The Great War aerial combat was almost entirely conducted by biplanes, with their low landing speeds, rapid climb rates and maneuverability. Post-war the Races resumed in 1920. The American Curtiss racing aircraft set the pattern for the 1920s, making way for Harold Mitchell's Supermarines in the 1930's. Having won the 1927 race at Venice Mitchell developed his ground-breaking aircraft into the iconic Spitfire powered by the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. This new generation of British fighter aircraft were to play a decisive role in defeating the Luftwaffe and thwarting the Nazis' invasion plans. This is a fascinating account of the air race series that had a huge influence on the development of flight. "

From the early days of motoring, British innovators led the way, building some of the world\u2019s most famous motorcycles, as well as some of the best performers. At one point, the rest of the motorcycle world followed Britain\u2019s lead, and by the late 1950s, the British were by far the largest producers of motorcycles in the world. However, barely a decade later, the British motorcycle industry was almost bankrupt and in utter disarray. Illustrated with over 150 photographs, this book explores the rise and fall of the British motorcycle industry, looking at its history through the years and then at the motorcycles themselves by brand, giving the complete story of these amazing machines.

Previously, these had been in the hands of a myriad of operators, some more dependable than others. Containing some 120 color photographs, including rare images from the postwar period, and detailed captions, this album shows the transition from prewar standards, which initially continued after the Second World War, to the modernization that was essential to encourage continued use of London\u2019s transport systems by the public in the face of increasing car ownership. Rekindling memories of the postwar period, this nostalgic color portrait looks at London Transport\u2019s buses, trolleybuses, trams and underground trains (both surface and tube stock) operating between 1949 and 1974.

                "From War to Peace tells the story of the adaptation from White Ensign to Red Ensign, and to flags of other nations, of the numerous classes of naval ships mainly built during the two world wars and surplus to requirements with the advent of peace. It also describes ships sourced from the United States Navy and elsewhere that were converted for commercial use. The most successful classes to transfer to the merchant service were the Hunt-class minesweepers of the Great War, Landing Craft, Tank, the salvage tugs of World War Two, and the wooden-hulled Fairmile launches which became familiar at seaside resorts in the 1950s and '60s; and, of course, the MFV classes that helped the fishing industry in the postwar years. The story includes the successful commercial conversions of many of the Flower and Castle Class corvettes and River Class frigates, notably the 1954 conversion of HMCS Stormont to a luxury yacht for the Greek shipping magnate Onassis. It describes why HMS Charybdis became a passenger liner in the Great War, and how HMS Albatross nearly became a luxury liner after World War Two, but in fact was transformed into a very unpopular emigrant ship and ended her days as a floating casino based at Cape Town. The author reveals the military antecedents of numerous commercial vessels that many would have thought were built especially for the service that they later maintained, and it illustrates just how many Royal Navy vessels ended up in private ownership. And the question is asked: if the military had not built so many ships that were eminently suitable for commercial adaptation, would the technical development of merchant shipping have progressed at a faster rate than it did? The answer is a definite 'no', and is illustrated in several ways. It was former naval vessels that promoted the early development of the Ro-Ro ferry; former naval ships introduced numerous design innovations, for example, the raised foredeck common for so many years on salvage tugs, and, above all, stripped of their military hardware, ex naval ships provided opportunities for modest investment where otherwise there would have been none. Copiously illustrated throughout, the book tells a fascinating story of invention and ingenious ship conversion, and of pragmatic adaptation in the financially stringent years after two world wars. "

                "Led by the USA with Western European partners, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed in 1949 to counter the Soviet threat. In response the Soviet Union assembled and dominated the Warsaw Pact in 1954. The mainstay of both alliances' groundforces were their main battle tanks (MBTs). Initially both sides relied on Second World War MBTs; in NATO's case the Sherman medium tank and its successor the M26 Pershing together with the British Centurion and the heavy Conqueror. The Soviets originally fielded the T-34-85 medium tank and the IS-2 and IS-3 heavy tank replaced by the T-10. Next came the T-54 followed by the T-55 and 155mm armed T-63 (1965). The final WP Cold War MBTs were the T-64, T-72 and T-80 all with 122mm main armament. By contrast, NATO nations increasingly deployed a range of MBTs; the widely used American Patton series (M46 through M48), British Chieftain (1963) and Challenger (1982), French AMX-13 (1950) and AMX-30. From 1963 the Bundeswehr was equipped with the homegrown Leopard 1 and 2. The US M60 series and M1 Abrams came into service from 1980. These and more MBTs and variants are covered in expert detail in this superbly illustrated book. "

Despite being produced during a troubled era of motor vehicle production in Britain, more than 400,000 Series IIIs were produced, and they are now considered cherished classics. Fully illustrated with over 190 color photographs, this book looks fondly at the numerous Land Rover Series III models that were produced successful against an uncertain backdrop. "

                "The city of York stands at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss on flat arable land called the Vale of York, which is bordered to the west by the Pennines, to the northeast by the North York Moors and to the east by the rolling Yorkshire Wolds. Outside the city are many beautiful small country villages and bus operators were needed to provide services linking these local villages and towns with York, especially on market days. Consequently, routes were very rural, and besides catering for the traditional market day shoppers, they often carried a considerable volume of passengers to work in York. This book, the follow-on to York Independent: Eastern Stage Bus Operators, tells the story of stage bus companies, including Hopes Motor Services, Hutchinson Brothers, Reliance Motor Services, G E Sykes & Son and Majestic of Cawood, who operated from the west of York. Including over 150 photographs, many in color, it shows how most of the companies covered started out as family-based operators running a service to the nearest local market town before expanding to offer excursions and private hires. It also shows how changes to the way of life, including the growth of car ownership, eventually killed off the majority of them. "

                "British Midland Airways existed under different identities for over 70 years, during which time it grew from a flying training school into a scheduled transatlantic airline operating wide-bodied Airbus aircraft. With the prime routes dominated by British Airways and its predecessors, it had to diversify, and one product of this was its \u201cinstant-airline\u201d concept, which saw its Boeing 707 aircraft flying in the liveries of many African and Middle Eastern companies. Later in its life, British Midland Airways felt confident enough to go \u201chead to head\u201d with British Airways on the UK domestic trunk routes. The acquisition of a major financial stake by Lufthansa in 2009 led to membership of the prestigious Star Alliance partnership, but even the German national airline could not find a way to stem accumulating losses, and, in 2011, the carrier was absorbed into British Airways. With over 140 images, this book charts the rise and fall of British Midland Airways. "

                "This detailed study of Japan's fearsome WWII fighter covers its legendary combat career along with color images and technical information.  The quality of Japan's Mitsubishi A6M Zero shocked Allies Forces at the outbreak of the Pacific War. Armed with two 20mm cannon and two 7.7mm machine-guns, it was highly maneuverable and structurally very strong, despite being lightweight. When it first took flight in 1939, it was far superior to any other fighter in the skies. During the first months of the Pacific War, the Zeros carved out an impressive combat record. For example, in the battle for Java alone, they destroyed 550 Allied aircraft. But it eventually outclassed by American fighters such as the Grumman F6F Wildcat and Vought Corsair. In the latter months, many were fitted with bombs and expended in Kamikaze suicide attacks. This book provides a detailed overview of the design and combat career of a fighter that made history. Ideal for modelers and military history enthusiasts, it offers a wealth of technical information, photographs and color profiles. "

                "When the Soviet Union fell in December 1991, there were close to 3,500 assorted Soviet-built airliners that could be deemed operational \u2014 more than there had ever been before. The vast majority of these Antonovs, Ilyushins, Tupolevs, and Yaks flew for Aeroflot, and were scattered far and wide at bases across the Soviet Union. Thirty years later, they have almost all disappeared. Now dominated by state-of-the-art Airbuses and Boeings, the world\u2019s airports and airways will never be the same again without the noise, smoke and charisma of these iconic designs from Soviet times. This book follows the fortunes of the great Soviet airliners over the last three decades and looks at what happened to this immense fleet: the fragmentation of Aeroflot into a myriad of new operators in the 1990s, the bankruptcies and consolidation of so many airlines that followed, and then the slow, inevitable disappearance of these aircraft from our skies. Illustrated with 220 photographs, most of which have never been published before, and supported by many anecdotes, facts and figures, this book conveys the nostalgia and wonder of this special, tumultuous time in aviation history.

Many of the airstrips into which the 748 formerly operated are now fully fledged international airports, with paved runways, sophisticated air traffic control and navigation equipment, and shops, but it was not always this way. In the early days, the 748 proved its worth worldwide by operating on dirt airstrips and at high elevations and temperatures. Spanning a period of almost 30 years, this book sets out to illustrate some of the many operators of the type, from the initial Series 1 to the final Series 2B. Fully illustrated with over 100 photographs, many of which have not previously been in the public domain, this book dives into the history and global impact of the Avro 748. "

During the 1930s, long-distance air travel was the preserve of the flying boat, which transported well-heeled passengers in ocean-liner style and comfort across the oceans. But then the Second World War came, and things changed. Suddenly, landplanes were more efficient, and in abundance: long concrete runways had been constructed during the war that could be used by a new generation of large transport aircraft; and endless developments in aircraft meant they could fly faster and for further distances. Commercial flying boat services resumed, but their days would be numbered. "

                "In a similar style to Comet!: The World's First Jet Airliner and Boeing Group: A History Graham Simons presents us with a colorful, thoroughly engrossing, well-researched and highly illustrated history of The British Overseas Airways Company, from its origin in 1940 to its closure in 1974.The scope of the book takes in the history of the Second World War, examining the ways in which this conflict shaped the development of the airline. BOAC kept wartime Britain connected with its colonies and the allied world, often under enemy fire, and initially with desperate shortages of long-range aircraft. It played an important role in the transportation of passengers during an incredibly fraught and dangerous era. Post-war, jets were brought into the mix and aircraft types such as the de Havilland Comet saw employment.In the 1970s, an Act of Parliament saw BOAC merged with BEA, with effect from 31 March 1974, forming today's British Airways. But the era of The British Overseas Airways Company marked an important bridge between wartime services and the contemporary operations that we recognize today as being part of British Airways' day-to-day working practices.The era 1940-1974 saw a great deal of development change the face of flight in a variety of contexts. By choosing to record the history of BOAC, Graham M. Simons is confronting an era of ongoing interest to students of aviation and historians of mid-Twentieth century history. "

Furthermore, electrification has changed a number of the lines beyond recognition. These changes have led to new electric units ousting the diesels and the introduction of HSTs on services between the Scottish cities. Illustrated with over 180 images, this book details the huge variety of trains, ranging from the everyday to the unusual, that have been seen on Scotland\u2019s rails in the last 15 years. "

The emphasis is pictorial rather than factual with the aim of using photographs provided by two transport charities as well as the author, all of which are unlikely to have appeared previously in print or on the Internet. Generally, images depict working trains surrounded by recognisable infrastructure, often with station nameboards visible. Such pictures should be of particular interest to railway modelers as well as invoking nostalgia for the older generation who were pursuing their hobby around the time the pictures were taken. Most of the branch lines covered were victims of the 1960s \"Beeching Axe\", with closure to passengers or complete closure coming even earlier in some cases. Most of the services depicted are steam operated although a few GWR and BR diesel railcars/multiple units are included. All the scenes seem to reflect a more leisurely way of life than exists today.

                "Go-Ahead began life as the Gateshead-based Go-Ahead Northern bus company after the privatization of the National Bus Company in 1987. Early expansion saw the acquisition of a number of smaller bus operators in the North East. During the 1990s, it entered London, where it rapidly became the largest provider of bus services in the UK capital. It has subsequently acquired operations across England. Rail privatization has presented another opportunity for the group and it currently operates Govia Thameslink Railway, comprising Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern as well as South Eastern. More recently, it has established an overseas presence and runs buses in Singapore and Dublin along with rail services in Germany and Norway. All of these are franchised operations. The Group continues to believe that public transport is best managed locally and its operating companies all retain local management and identities. Illustrated with over 150 color illustrations, this book looks at its first 25 years in detail with a brief update of developments since then. "
