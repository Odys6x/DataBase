                "How is sexuality put to work in the social network of power? Why is power so obsessively inscribed on the sexualized female body? These questions are at the heart of naturalism's preoccupation with female sexuality. Presenting a revisionary reading of such crucial German, Canadian, and American texts as Fanny Essler, Settlers of the Marsh, and Sister Carrie, Irene Gammel reveals that naturalism is frequently implicated in the very power structures it critiques. A predominantly male genre, naturalism appropriated a disruptive female sexuality not so much to \"liberate\" it from the shackles of Victorian repression as to contain it within the male boundaries of naturalism. Reading European and North American naturalism through the lens of feminist and Foucauldian theories of power, Gammel argues that twentieth-century naturalism increasingly exposes the genre's internal ideological contradictions.

",
                "These authors embraced and incorporated Darwin's theories, insights, and language, creating an increasingly dark and violent view of sexual love in American realist literature. In The Descent of Love, Bender carefully rereads the works of William Dean Howells, Henry James, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Sarah Orne Jewett, Kate Chopin, Harold Frederic, Charles W. Chesnutt, Edith Wharton, and Ernest Hemingway, teasing from them a startling but utterly convincing preoccupation with questions of sexual selection. Competing for readership as novelists who best grasped the \"real\" nature of human love, these writers also participated in a heated social debate over racial and sexual differences and the nature of sex itself. Influenced more by The Descent of Man than by the Origin of Species, Bender's novelists built upon Darwin's anthropological and zoological materials to anatomize their characters' courtship behavior, returning consistently to concerns with physical beauty, natural dominance, and the power to select a mate.

                "Because naturalism seems antithetical to modernism and literary existentialism, slight attention has been given to the existence of a contemporary, or post-World War II, naturalism. Indeed, the very term serves as a synonym for old fashioned. While understandable, this view has contributed to the misunderstanding, if not neglect, of several American writers who came to prominence in the late 1940s and 1950s. James Jones coined the term the unfound generation to describe these writers. The career of Nelson Algren exemplifies this phenomenon. Nelson Algren has always been an enigmatic figure, even at the peak of his career. Algren himself was the source of some of the confusion but he was also the victim of a long continuing critical misperception, that as a disciple of Theodore Dreiser he stressed external reality and social protest. In fact, while he never wavered in his commitment to the lumpenproletariat, society's outcasts, his vision evolved significantly, especially through his acquaintance with Sartre, Beauvoir, and Celine. Algren's best work reflects his despair over the absurd at least as much as his outrage over social and economic injustice. In Confronting the Horror, James R. Giles examines the evolution of Algren's major themes--external oppression and internal anxiety. He discusses Algren's fiction in relation to Maxim Gorky's explanation of the lower depths and the works of two contemporary writers, Hubert Selby, Jr., and John Rechy, who combine naturalistic technique with a largely existential, absurdist vision. Giles conclusion is forcefully argued, that Algren's novels are thematically richer and more complex than hitherto regarded and represent the work of an American writer of the first order. "

In The Weaver-God, He Weaves, Christopher Sten sets out to correct this widespread view, showing not only what Melville knew about the novelist's craft but how he appropriated and transformed a whole series of distinct genres: Typee is presented in the context of the popular romance, with its paired themes of sex and violence; Omoo is viewed in the framework of early Spanish and later French examples of the picaresque novel; and Mardi is seen as an instance of the once widely popular genre of the imaginary voyage. Sten also reveals how Melville radically transformed certain existing genres?the epic novel in Moby-Dick and the historical novel in Israel Potter?or forged profound new directions for genres still in their early stages; the psychological novel in Pierre and the experimental novel in the Confidence-Man. Sten speculates that it is because Melville was so idiosyncratic and inventive that so few critics have understood his close relationship tot eh various novelistic forms. While individual chapters provide discussions of the genre principles Melville employed, Sten's introduction offers valuable theoretical isnight into the importance of genre study (encompassing recent work by Todorov, Hirsch, Hernadi, Jauss, Culler, Scholes, Fowler, Rosmarin, and others), both in the evaluation of literary texts and in the still more fundamental enterprise of determining their meaning.

                "Stephen R. Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant examines Donaldson's first three novels in an attempt to define their place in the fantasy canon. The book begins with an extensive introduction to the fantasy genre in which W. A. Senior eloquently defends fantasy against charges of being mere escapism, or simply juvenile, and not warranting serious critical consideration. The heart of the text treats such issues as Donaldson's debt to Tolkien, the use of myth and the creation of sustaining mythologies within the novel, and the theme of life and death-a topic that fantasy, by its very nature, can explore in radical fashion. In chapter seven, Senior discusses the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. He concludes that Donaldson has created an important contribution to the canon because of his serious intent and adult concerns, his powerful mythopoesis, and his manipulation of the conventions of epic fantasy. As appendixes to this work, there are two illuminating interviews with Donaldson in which the author of the Covenant series reveals his own views on questions raised by Senior's study. Stephen R. Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant will be of great interest both to devout Donaldson fans and to general readers of fantasy. "

                "This is a ground-breaking study of the psychological and cultural impact of the Cold War on the imaginations of citizens in the UK and US. The Literary Cold War examines writers working at the hazy borders between aesthetic project and political allegory, with specific attention being paid to Vladimir Nabokov and Graham Greene as Cold War writers. The book looks at the special relationship as a form of paranoid plotline governing key Anglo-American texts from Storm Jameson through John Dos Passos to Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, as well as examining the figure of the non-aligned neutral observer.

                "Stephen R. Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant examines Donaldson's first three novels in an attempt to define their place in the fantasy canon. The book begins with an extensive introduction to the fantasy genre in which W. A. Senior eloquently defends fantasy against charges of being mere escapism, or simply juvenile, and not warranting serious critical consideration. The heart of the text treats such issues as Donaldson's debt to Tolkien, the use of myth and the creation of sustaining mythologies within the novel, and the theme of life and death-a topic that fantasy, by its very nature, can explore in radical fashion. In chapter seven, Senior discusses the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. He concludes that Donaldson has created an important contribution to the canon because of his serious intent and adult concerns, his powerful mythopoesis, and his manipulation of the conventions of epic fantasy. As appendixes to this work, there are two illuminating interviews with Donaldson in which the author of the Covenant series reveals his own views on questions raised by Senior's study. Stephen R. Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant will be of great interest both to devout Donaldson fans and to general readers of fantasy. "

The delight at the end of a joke is the result of a complex set of conditions and processes, and Cohen takes us through these conditions in a philosophical exploration of humor. He considers questions of audience, selection of joke topics, the ethnic character of jokes, and their morality, all with plenty of examples that will make you either chuckle or wince.

The delight at the end of a joke is the result of a complex set of conditions and processes, and Cohen takes us through these conditions in a philosophical exploration of humor. He considers questions of audience, selection of joke topics, the ethnic character of jokes, and their morality, all with plenty of examples that will make you either chuckle or wince. Jokes: more humorous than other philosophy books, more philosophical than other humor books.\"--Jacket. "

In Melville's Muse, John Wenke discusses what it means - both biographically and textually - for Melville to combine philosophy and aesthetics. Wenke focuses on Melville's failures and successes in developing fictional forms to contain and express metaphysical speculations. He examines how the author appropriated and transformed elements of his Calvinist-Lutheran heritage; his eclectic reading in ancient, Renaissance, and contemporary writings; his Romantic Zeitgeist; and his cultural and political milieu. Through his analysis, he clearly shows that consciously articulated life choices led Melville to create texts that are both derivative and revolutionary. This study offers a new interpretation of some existing materials but also provides many specific discoveries of Melville's use of Plato, Francois Rabelais, Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, Robert Burton, Sir Thomas Browne, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Shelley, Thomas Carlyle, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, among others. It combines traditional historicism with contemporary theoretical practice, resulting in an interdisciplinary jargon-free critical narrative. Of particular interest to specialists in Melvillean studies, American Romanticism, and 19th-century American literature, it also will appeal to scholars of philosophy and literature, literature and culture, and literary criticism.

                "Since the opening of Vassar College in 1865, objections to higher education for women have ranged from charges that females were mentally and physically incapable of learning to the belief that educating women would destroy society. Underlying all arguments was the folk wisdom which declared that women could not live and work together. To counteract such beliefs, women's colleges tried to create a special kind of space and new role models that would allow women to exist for a short time in idyllic (or, at least, idealized) conditions. The debate over women's education, for the good or ill of society, generated a great deal of \"print,\" including short stories and novels. Shirley Marchalonis guides us through the history of this fiction, its depiction of the complexities of the college experience, and the conflicting attitudes that teetered between fascination and fear, celebration and regret. Using novels, short stories, and some juvenile fiction from 1865 to 1940 - all of it specifically about college \"girls\"--She examines these ideas, the way they developed over time, and their significance in understanding women's education and women's history. The debate over separate colleges for women continues to this day and can be better understood in the context of this informative and entertaining look at the past. "

Until recently, the accepted canon has consisted almost exclusively of American white male combat narratives, which often reflect and perpetuate Asian stereotypes. Renny Christopher introduces material that displays a bicultural perspective, including works by Vietnamese exile writers and by lesser-known Euro-Americans who attempt to bridge the cultural gap. ",
                "Christopher traces the history of American stereotyping of Asians and shows how Euro-American ethnocentricity has limited most American authors' ability to represent fairly the Vietnamese in their stories. By giving us access to Vietnamese representations of the war, she creates a context for understanding the way the war was experienced from the \"other\" side, and she offers perceptive, well-documented analyses of how and why Americans have so emphatically excised the Vietnamese from narratives about a war fought in their own country.

                "Victims of rape and torture experience a forced intimacy with their violators that may be exaggerated, unveiled, or obscured in the act of representation. Focusing on acts of \"intimate violence\" and their fictional representations, this study explores the disturbing dynamics that propel readers into intimate contact with the power of the rapist or the vulnerability of the victim. Using such notorious works as D.M. Thomas's The White Hotel, Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, and Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho, as well as novels by William Faulkner, George Orwell, Gloria Naylor, and Louise Erdrich, Intimate Violence offers a theory of reading violation that emphasizes the reader's status as negotiator between the conventions of representation and the material dynamics of violence. Suspended between material and semiotic worlds, the reader in the scene of violence must adopt a position relative not only to victim and violator but to the attitudes about violation encoded in representation and experienced through reading. The reader may find the victim's body reduced to literary convention or unveiled with agonizing specificity, be swept up by the rhythms of the violator's force or experience the jarring disruptions of the victim's pain. Appropriating elements of diverse theoretical models, such as feminist film theory, Marxism, and theories of the body, Intimate Violence renders visible the way in which representations of violation may exaggerate the reader's disembodied status or, conversely, lend that reader a textual body which delimits his or her experience of the text.

                "Victims of rape and torture experience a forced intimacy with their violators that may be exaggerated, unveiled, or obscured in the act of representation. Focusing on acts of \"intimate violence\" and their fictional representations, this study explores the disturbing dynamics that propel readers into intimate contact with the power of the rapist or the vulnerability of the victim. Using such notorious works as D.M. Thomas's The White Hotel, Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, and Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho, as well as novels by William Faulkner, George Orwell, Gloria Naylor, and Louise Erdrich, Intimate Violence offers a theory of reading violation that emphasizes the reader's status as negotiator between the conventions of representation and the material dynamics of violence. Suspended between material and semiotic worlds, the reader in the scene of violence must adopt a position relative not only to victim and violator but to the attitudes about violation encoded in representation and experienced through reading. The reader may find the victim's body reduced to literary convention or unveiled with agonizing specificity, be swept up by the rhythms of the violator's force or experience the jarring disruptions of the victim's pain. Appropriating elements of diverse theoretical models, such as feminist film theory, Marxism, and theories of the body, Intimate Violence renders visible the way in which representations of violation may exaggerate the reader's disembodied status or, conversely, lend that reader a textual body which delimits his or her experience of the text.

What is it about this eight-volume serial novel for children that accounts for its enduring power? And what does the popularity of these books tell us about the currents of American culture?\" \"Ann Romines interweaves personal observation with scholarly analysis to address these questions. Writing from a feminist perspective and drawing on the resources of gender studies, cultural studies, and new historicist reading, she examines both the content of the novels and the process of their creation. She explores the relationship between mother and daughter working as collaborative authors and calls into question our assumptions about plot, juvenile fiction, and constructions of gender on the nineteenth-century frontier and in the Depression years when the Little House books were written.\" \"This is a book that will appeal both to scholars and to general readers who might welcome an engaging and accessible companion volume to the Little House novels.\"--Jacket.

                "Dreaming Revolution usefully employs current critical theory to address how the European novel of class revolt was transformed into the American novel of imperial expansion. Bradfield shows that early American romantic fiction - including works by William Godwin, Charles Brockden Brown, James Fenimore Cooper, and Edgar Allan Poe - can and should be considered as part of a genre too often limited to the Nineteenth-century European novel. Beginning with Godwin's Caleb Williams, Bradfield describes the ways in which revolution legitimates itself as a means of establishing Political consensus. For European revolutionaries like Godwin or Rousseau, the tyranny of the king must be replaced by the more indisputable authority of human reason. In other words, democratic revolution makes people free to investigate the same truths and arrive at the same democratic conclusions. In the American novel, however, the Enlightenment's idealized pursuit of abstract truth becomes restructured as a pursuit of abstract space. Instead of revealing knowledge, Americans explore further territories, manifest destiny, limitless regions of the yet-to-be-colonized and the still-to-be-known. In a spirited discussion of works by Brown, Cooper and Poe, Bradfield argues that Americans take the class dynamics of the European psychological novel and apply them to the American landscape, reimagining psychological spaces as geographical ones. Class distinctions become refigured in terms of the common people's pursuit of a meaning vaster than themselves - a meaning which leads them to imagine the always expanding body of colonial America. However, since class conflict is never successfully eliminated or forgotten, the memory of class struggle always reemerges in the narrative like a half-repressed dream of politics. In Dreaming Revolution, Bradfield reveals and interprets these dreams, opening these American novels to a richer and more rewarding reading. "

                "Since the nation-state sprang into being in 1965, Singapore literature in English has blossomed energetically, and yet there have been few books focusing on contextualizing and analyzing Singapore literature despite the increasing international attention garnered by Singaporean writers. This volume brings Anglophone Singapore literature to a wider global audience for the first time, embedding it more closely within literary developments worldwide. Drawing upon postcolonial studies, Singapore studies, and critical discussions in transnationalism and globalization, essays unearth and introduce neglected writers, cast new light on established writers, and examine texts in relation to their specific Singaporean local-historical contexts while also engaging with contemporary issues in Singapore society. Singaporean writers are producing work informed by debates and trends in queer studies, feminism, multiculturalism and social justice - work which urgently calls for scholarly engagement. This groundbreaking collection of essays aims to set new directions for further scholarship in this exciting and various body of writing from a place that, despite being just a small 'red dot' on the global map, has much to say to scholars and students worldwide interested in issues of nationalism, diaspora, cosmopolitanism, neoliberalism, immigration, urban space, as well as literary form and content. This book brings Singapore literature and literary criticism into greater global legibility and charts pathways for future developments. "
