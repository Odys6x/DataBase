                "In The Young and the Digital, S. Craig Watkins skillfully draws from more than 500 surveys and 350 in-depth interviews with young people, parents, and educators to understand how a digital lifestyle is affecting the ways youth learn, play, bond, and communicate. Timely and deeply relevant, the book covers the influence of MySpace and Facebook, the growing appetite for \"anytime, anywhere\" media and \"fast entertainment,\" how online \"digital gates\" reinforce race and class divisions, and how technology is transforming America's classrooms. Watkins also debunks popular myths surrounding cyberpredators, Internet addiction, and social isolation. The result is a fascinating portrait, both celebratory and wary, about the coming of age of the first fully wired generation. From the Trade Paperback edition. "

This continuum has its roots in our public discussions of the war on terror and the metaphors through which they are repeatedly framed.

Brands can now be strengthened or destroyed by the use of social media. Online networking sites are being used as giant, free focus groups. Advertising is less effective at influencing consumers than the opinions of their peers. If you aren't using social media in your business strategy, you are already behind your competition; Explores how the concept of \"Socialnomics\" is changing the way businesses produce, market, and sell, eliminating inefficient marketing and middlemen, and making products easier and cheaper for consumers to obtain; Learn how successful businesses are connecting with consumers like never before via Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other social media sites; A must-read for anyone wanting to learn about, and harness the power of social media, rather than be squashed by it; Author Erik Qualman is a former online marketer for several Top 100 brands and the current Global Vice President of Online Marketing for the world's largest private education firm. Socialnomics is essential book for anyone who wants to understand the implications of social media, and how businesses can tap the power of social media to increase their sales, cut their marketing costs, and reach consumers directly.\"--Ebook Library description.

Nearly every social media book that's been published either targets the consumer market or treats B2B as an afterthought. If you search for \"B2B social media marketing\" on Amazon, the results revealed not a single relevant title. In fact, Paul's own two social media books both turn up in the top 10 results, despite the fact that neither of them directly targets this market. This is a stunning gap, given that some of the earliest adopters of social media were B2B companies like IBM, Sun Microsystems and Cisco. There is also plentiful evidence that B2B marketers are hungry for information about this topic. At the recent Inbound Marketing Summit in Boston, a show of hands from the audience of 350 marketers revealed that about 70% identified themselves as B2B. The authors' own consulting and speaking engagements, which were principally to consumer audiences a couple of years ago, are now almost entirely to B2B companies and trade associations. The Business Marketing Association estimates B2B marketing spending at over $80 billion annually. Among the top 50 companies on the Fortune 500, nearly all have significant B2B sales. What's more, the B2B market tends to be less price sensitive than the consumer market, meaning that readers are more likely to pay a premium price for specialized guide and to buy in quantity. How Businesses Reach Businesses will build upon our extensive experience in this space, the authors' two successful social media books, and more than a decade of collective immersion in this topic.

Within Southeast Asia, while most governments subscribe to the belief that new media technological advancement improves their nation's socio-economic conditions, they also worry about its cultural and political effects. This book examines how these set of dynamics operate through its study of new media in contemporary Malaysian society. Using the social imaginary framework and adopting a socio-historical approach, the book explains the varied understandings of new media as a continuing process wherein individuals and their societies operate in tandem to create, negotiate and enact the meaning ascribed to concepts and ideas. In doing so, it also highlights the place of non-users in national technological policies. Through its examination of the ideation and development of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor mega project to-date and reference to the seminal socio-political events of 2007-2012 including the 2008 General Elections, Bersih and Hindraf rallies, this book provides a clear explanation for new media's prominence in the multi-ethnic and majority Islamic society of Malaysia today\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "Should violence in the media be limited by law? Many experts would say yes, arguing that violence on the screen and over the airwaves begets violence in the streets and in our homes. Others think government interference with the media's freedom of expression is a worse problem than the one it's supposed to correct. Who is right? This volume offers no easy answers. Instead, it supplies a balanced historical perspective, analysis of research data on both sides of the question, and careful consideration of opposing arguments. Its goal is to provide students, teachers, researchers, and general readers with the background needed to understand this complex issue. Contents include a thoughtful, thorough introduction; a chronology of major events in the development of the controversy; biographical sketches of the central figures in the debate; analysis of resolutions, studies, laws, and other documents; a directory of organizations; annotated lists of print and nonprint resources; a glossary; and an index. Comprehensive and easy to use, this volume not only provides a wealth of useful information but also points readers toward pathways for further investigation. "

This trust in social media reflects a lack of trust in local mainstream media and official sources of information. "

Others think government interference with the media's freedom of expression is a worse problem than the one it's supposed to correct. Who is right? This volume offers no easy answers. Instead, it supplies a balanced historical perspective, analysis of research data on both sides of the question, and careful consideration of opposing arguments. Its goal is to provide students, teachers, researchers, and general readers with the background needed to understand this complex issue. Contents include a thoughtful, thorough introduction; a chronology of major events in the development of the controversy; biographical sketches of the central figures in the debate; analysis of resolutions, studies, laws, and other documents; a directory of organizations; annotated lists of print and nonprint resources; a glossary; and an index. Comprehensive and easy to use, this volume not only provides a wealth of useful information but also points readers toward pathways for further investigation. "

Rather than the usual process of watching a film, in those films which return the gaze of the viewer, the film looks at us, confronting our voyeur's embrace of the spectacle it presents. The book cites examples as diverse as Andy Warhol's Vinyl, Laurel and Hardy two-reel comedies, the films of Jean-Marie Straub, Jean-Luc Godard, Roberto Rossellini, and Wesley E. Barry's Creation of The Humanoids. It also discusses the history of the returned gaze in video, pornography, surveillance systems, and the related plastic arts. "

Aitken uncovers how the British official film, and British official information agencies, adapted to the epochal contexts of the Cold War and end of empire. In addition to an extensive introduction, which touches on a number of critical issues related to the post-war British official film, the book provides an account of how the tradition of film-making associated with the British documentary film movement spread into the region during the post-war period, and how that tradition was contested by a 'Colonial Office' tradition of film-making. The volume concludes by covering the rise of television in the region within the context of developing post-colonial authoritarian states in Singapore and Malaysia, and the continuation of colonial authoritarianism in Hong Kong.

                "When we think of the Internet, we generally think of Amazon, Google, Hotmail, Napster, MySpace, and other sites for buying products, searching for information, downloading entertainment, chatting with friends, or posting photographs. In the academic literature about the Internet, however, these uses are rarely covered. The Internet and American Businessfills this gap, picking up where most scholarly histories of the Internet leave off--with the commercialization of the Internet established and its effect on traditional business a fact of life. These essays, describing challenges successfully met by some companies and failures to adapt by others, are a first attempt to understand a dynamic and exciting period of American business history. Tracing the impact of the commercialized Internet since 1995 on American business and society, the book describes new business models, new companies and adjustments by established companies, the rise of e-commerce, and community building; it considers dot-com busts and difficulties encountered by traditional industries; and it discusses such newly created problems as copyright violations associated with music file-sharing and the proliferation of Internet pornography.

                "This book is a study of one of the most insidious and pervasive phenomena in the study and reception of cinema: the \"returned gaze\" from the screen in which the audience is actually surveilled by the film being projected on the screen. Rather than the usual process of watching a film, in those films which return the gaze of the viewer, the film looks at us, confronting our voyeur's embrace of the spectacle it presents. The book cites examples as diverse as Andy Warhol's Vinyl, Laurel and Hardy two-reel comedies, the films of Jean-Marie Straub, Jean-Luc Godard, Roberto Rossellini, and Wesley E. Barry's Creation of The Humanoids. It also discusses the history of the returned gaze in video, pornography, surveillance systems, and the related plastic arts. "

                "Hitherto, the academic study of Indian cinema has focused primarily on Bollywood, despite the fact that the Tamil film industry, based in southern India, has overtaken Bollywood in terms of annual output. This book examines critically the cultural and cinematic representations in Tamil cinema. It outlines its history and distinctive characteristics, and proceeds to consider a number of important themes such as gender, religion, class, caste, fandom, cinematic genre, the politics of identity and diaspora. Throughout, the book cogently links the analysis to wider social, political and cultural phenomena in Tamil and Indian society. Overall, it is an exciting and original contribution to an under-studied field, also facilitating a fresh consideration of the existing body of scholarship on Indian cinema. "
