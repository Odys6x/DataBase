In this incredibly enlightening and motivational audio program, Steinem puts into social and historical context the role of society in the treatment and mistreatment of women. Excerpt from recording: \"As you can tell from the title I had given to my speech, \"Scholars, Witches and Other Freedom Fighters,\" ... I couldn't resist reflecting on the reasons that both are freedom fighters, even though scholars are serene, non-activist, honorable, and respectable and witches are emotional, activist and all-together dishonorable. In other words, the first are masculine in their imagery and the second are feminine in their imagery. But both have a role to play as revolutionaries and freedom fighters for us all.\" "

Dr. Mitchell brings light to the essence and significance of the concepts featured in The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown. This recording is a great primer for anyone wanting more information on the ideas introduced in The Lost Symbol. Excerpt from recording: \"The evidence is clear that we are an evolving, creating, self organizing, learning universe and...that instead of being passive participants in this play we are the major actors and have been all along. We just forgot who and what we are.\" "
