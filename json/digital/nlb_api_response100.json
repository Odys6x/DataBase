They traveled on horseback, by narrow gauge railroad, horse-drawn wagon, or Model T Fords, sometimes working together from the studio they shared in Durango, sometimes working alone. They went to mining camps in the nearby San Juan Mountains as well as to the Navajo, Jicarilla, Apache, Acoma, and Zuni Indian reservations. What they preserved in their photographs takes the viewer back to a vanished era, but exquisitely preserves a sense of both time and place.\"--BOOK JACKET. \"Now, for the first time, H. Jackson Clark has collected the entire corpus of Pennington and Updike's wonderful images in Glass Plates & Wagon Ruts. Taken together, these photographs - highly valued and eager sought by collectors - are a provocative visual record of the Southwest that is of interest to anyone who loves this beautiful country and its colorful past.\"--Jacket.

                "An exploration of the rich and varied relationship between photography and the most recent Argentine dictatorship.   Familiar Faces  offers a diverse, theoretically rich, and empirically informed exploration of photography in Argentina\u2019s memorial, political, and artistic landscape.\u00a0 During the country\u2019s most recent civic-military dictatorship (1976\u20131983), 30,000 people were disappeared or killed by the state. Over the decades, vernacular and professional photographs have been central to the Argentine struggle for justice. They were used not only to protest the disappearances under the dictatorship and to denounce the authorities, but also as tools of political and social activism, and for remembering the disappeared. With contributions from leading Argentina-based anthropologists, ethnographers, curators, art scholars, media researchers, and photographers,  Familiar Faces  moves beyond the traditional considerations of representation, focusing instead on the ways in which photography is continuously reimagined as a tool of memory, mourning, and political and judicial activism. In so doing, it considers the diverse uses of press photography; artistic practice; photographs of the disappeared in domestic rituals; photographs of the inmates of torture centers; the reclamation of images taken by the dictatorial state for memorial and activist purposes.\u00a0 Written and published at a crucial moment in Argentine memory politics,  Familiar Faces  offers a geographically and formally diverse selection of case studies, with international as well as regional resonance. While firmly rooted in this national context, the book contributes to wider, global debates about the increasingly pervasive role of the photographic image in relation to state-sponsored, large-scale violence.

                "\"This vibrant and penetrating study.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. opens a window on American culture between the world wars.\" \u2014 Publishers Weekly    Seeing America  explores the camera work of five women who directed their visions toward influencing social policy and cultural theory. Taken together, they visually articulated the essential ideas occupying the American consciousness in the years between the world wars. Melissa McEuen examines the work of Doris Ulmann, who made portraits of celebrated artists in urban areas and lesser-known craftspeople in rural places; Dorothea Lange, who magnified human dignity in the midst of poverty and unemployment; Marion Post Wolcott, a steadfast believer in collective strength as the antidote to social ills and the best defense against future challenges; Margaret Bourke-White, who applied avant-garde advertising techniques in her exploration of the human condition; and Berenice Abbott, a devoted observer of the continuous motion and chaotic energy that characterized the modern cityscape. Combining feminist biography with analysis of visual texts, McEuen considers the various prisms though which each woman saw and revealed America. Winner of the 1999 Emily Toth Award for the best feminist study of popular culture given by the Women's Caucus of the Popular Culture Association. \"A rich resource for anyone interested in the history of photography, women's history, and American history in general.\" \u2014 Bloomsbury Review  \"A valiant, well-researched effort to bridge the history of visual culture with American social and political history.\" \u2014 Journal of American History  \"The best books always leave their audience wanting more.

                "The very thing that makes wide-angle photography so compelling also makes it a challenge: While you're sure to capture a vast scene using a wide-angle lens, it can be difficult to direct the viewer's attention when so many elements are included in an image. For many photographers, the results of their wide-angle attempts are a disappointment and they just can't seem to achieve that \"Wow\" they are hoping for in their images.   Whether you're new to wide-angle lenses or you've been frustrated by them for a long time, expert photographer, teacher, and author Chris Marquardt is here to help. Wide-Angle Photography is packed with information\u2014as well as beautiful and inspiring photography\u2014that will help you take your wide-angle image making to the next level.  In a friendly, accessible manner Chris walks you through in-depth discussions of both the advantages and the pitfalls of wide-angle photography, the fundamentals you need to know, composition and design principles, and the specific genres in which wide-angle lenses can be used to create outstanding images\u2014not only for landscape photography, but for portrait, street, architectural, and interior photography, as well. Throughout the book, Chris offers hands-on exercises that drive home the concepts being taught so you can learn by doing. Chris also dedicates two full chapters to tilt-shift lenses for those who are interested in exploring and maximizing the fascinating capabilities these kinds of lenses offer.  Topics include:  Types of lenses and filters  Understanding depth of field  Angles of view, crop factors, and focal lengths  Handling distortion and aberrations  Composition, design, and context  Point of view and perspective  Wide-angle for various genres  Panoramas and stitching images  Tilt-shift lenses  Hands-on exercises  And much more...

The longest-reigning monarch in British history, Queen Elizabeth II has been at the centre of British life for almost a century. She's led a very public life, seen by millions through photographs, film and television, from the time of her birth in 1926 to the final years of her reign. The embodiment of Britain, she has been a constant, knowledgeable presence in our politics and culture since she came to the throne in 1952.  This book celebrates the life of Queen Elizabeth II through photographs and still images, drawn largely from the archives of the BBC, an organisation that received its royal charter only one year after she was born. From her earliest days and first moments of public life, to her Platinum Jubilee and the weddings of her children and grandchildren, this is a lavish tribute to the most public of monarchs, an iconic figure in the hearts and minds of millions throughout the world.

When you work hard, you play hard, and Pittsburgh is a hardworking city. So, when Prohibition hit the Steel City, it created a level of violence and corruption residents had never witnessed. Illegal producers ran stills in kitchens, basements, bathroom tubs, warehouses and even abandoned distilleries. War between gangs of bootleggers resulted in a number of murders and bombings that placed Pittsburgh on the same level as New York City and Chicago in criminal activity. John Bazzano ordered the killing of the Volpe brothers but did so without the permission of Mafia bosses; his battered body was later found on the street in Brooklyn. Author Richard Gazarik details the shady side of the Steel City during a tumultuous era. "

Sheila Swan and Peter Laufer take readers on a journey, not only along the Las Vegas Strip, but down quiet, two-lane rural roads punctuated by neon signs\u2014those glistening beacons that represent commerce in the vast Great Basin. The photographers' stunning work captures the argon violets, krypton purples, helium golds, and xenon blues that glow amid the nighttime desert sky.   Readers will discover that neon is not just a medium for casino advertising. The colorful images of cowboys and cowgirls, animals, desert landscapes, and a myriad of other creative designs all illuminate Americana. The neon sign helps define Nevada and its businesses, from bars and casinos to the stores, restaurants, motels, and theaters that line the streets of the Silver State's cities and towns, and those rural areas that are barely a blip on the map. With a compelling blend of striking full-color photographs and fascinating historical commentary, this book celebrates an art form that wholly embraces the state's unique personality.   First published in 1994, this newly updated and expanded edition of  Neon Nevada  explores the resurgence of this art form during the last decade, which has resulted in an appreciation of Nevada neon that will never fade. This survey of neon casts the new edition as a defining source for neon scholars and attracts neon aficionados to what can only be defined as a medium as distinctive and interesting as Nevada itself.

                "In honor of the one hundredth anniversary of George H. W. Bush\u2019s birth, this visually stunning chronicle features never-before-published photos and memories celebrating the forty-first president\u2019s vision of leadership as service to country\u2014curated by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning biographer Jon Meacham.  Lavishly illustrated,  The Call to Serve  is an intimate, illuminating portrait of the forty-first president, a man who was so much more than just his politics. In words and images\u2014many found in a lifetime of scrapbooks kept by Barbara Pierce Bush\u2014Jon Meacham brings George H. W. Bush vividly to life. From the values of integrity, empathy, and grace that Bush learned in childhood to his leadership at the highest levels in tumultuous times, the forty-first president embodied an ideal of service that warrants attention in our own divided time. Bush pursued a life of service to America through his heroic combat experience in the Pacific during World War II, his political rise in Texas, his serving as U.S. ambassador to the UN, his time as envoy to China and as director of the CIA, his tenure as Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice president, and his election as the forty-first president of the United States. Set against the background of America during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, this book commemorates the legacy of a man who was far from perfect\u2014he could be cutthroat on the campaign trail\u2014but whose ambition was not an end unto itself. Bush\u2019s drive to succeed was, rather, a means to put the values of balance, patriotism, and respect for others into action in the political arena. Toward the end of Bush\u2019s life, the forty-fourth president, Barack Obama, said that Bush put the country first \u201cboth before he was president, while he was president, and ever since.\u201d Featuring more than 450 photographs, Meacham\u2019s introduction and commentary throughout, and narration drawn from his biography of George H.

                "In  Warring Visions , Thy Phu explores photography from dispersed communities throughout Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora, both during and after the Vietnam War, to complicate narratives of conflict and memory. While the visual history of the Vietnam War has been dominated by American documentaries and war photography, Phu turns to photographs circulated by the Vietnamese themselves, capturing a range of subjects, occasions, and perspectives. Phu's concept of warring visions refers to contrasts in the use of war photos in North Vietnam, which highlighted national liberation and aligned themselves with an international audience, and those in South Vietnam, which focused on family and everyday survival. Phu also uses warring visions to enlarge the category of war photography, a genre that usually consists of images illustrating the immediacy of combat and the spectacle of violence, pain, and wounded bodies. She pushes this genre beyond such definitions by analyzing pictures of family life, weddings, and other quotidian scenes of life during the war. Phu thus expands our understanding of how war is waged, experienced, and resolved. "

Whether you want to take better photos in your everyday life or make a full-time income as a photographer, author and professional photographer David Molnar shows you where to start.   In Learning to See, you'll be introduced to a five-part framework that teaches you how to:   See : have a vision for your shot and execute that vision.   Shoot : become technically proficient with your camera.   Edit : help re-create the emotion from the day of the shoot.   Develop : identify your area of focus for photography.   Earn : start getting paid for your art.  It's a proven process every photographer follows but few talk about. However, if you use it, it will shave years off the learning curve that David himself went through as an amateur photographer.  As its core principle, this book will teach you to learn how to see, because in the end, that's what a photographer does: notice what other people often miss and understand how to capture those things in a masterful way.

                "America's greatest photographer on his greatest subject\u2014featuring the Yosemite Special Edition Prints, a collectible collection of photographs selected by Ansel Adams during his lifetime, yet never before published in book form.    The photographs of Ansel Adams are among America's finest artistic treasures, and form the basis of his tremendous legacy of environmental activism. In the late 1950s, Adams selected eight photographs of Yosemite National Park to offer exclusively to park visitors as affordable souvenirs. He hoped that these images might inspire tourists to become activists by transmitting to them the same awe and respect for nature that Yosemite had instilled in him. Over the following decades, Adams added to this collection to create a stunning view of Yosemite in all its majesty. These photographs, the Yosemite Special Edition Prints, form the core of this essential volume. Adams' luminous images of Yosemite's unique rock formations, waterfalls, meadows, trees, and nature details are among the most distinctive of his career. Today, with America's public lands increasingly under threat, his creative vision remains as relevant and convincing as ever. Introduced by bestselling photographer Pete Souza, with an essay by Adams' darkroom assistant Alan Ross,  Ansel Adams' Yosemite  is a powerful continuation of Adams' artistic and environmental legacies, and a compelling statement during a precarious time for the American earth.

                "A stunning visual and personal journey in search of the iconic big cat, the snow leopard.  The snow leopard, known as the ghost of the mountains, is an elusive predator that has captured the human imagination for eons. Yet, by nature secretive, living at altitudes of up to 19,000 feet in one of the world's harshest environments, it is notoriously difficult to see. Those lucky enough to encounter one speak of the experience as momentous, transformative, even spiritual. In this handsomely illustrated, eloquent book, published in partnership with the Snow Leopard Conservancy, world-renowned wildlife photographers, naturalists, and conservationists take the reader closer than most humans will ever get to knowing snow leopards and understanding why these beautiful big cats have for so long been considered the most mysterious of all. More than 130 breathtaking photographs\u2014all taken in the wild, and none with camera traps\u2014accompany personal narratives and anecdotes that convey the experience of learning to see; the patient pursuit, following the tracks and other sign for a momentary glimpse; an unexpected encounter; watching the predator hunt; a magical moment with a mother and her cubs. A special \"seek and find\" section challenges readers to spot the snow leopard\u2014to discern camouflage from rock and snow. The text also relates the natural history of the snow leopard, its cultural significance and place in lore, its interactions with local peoples, and information about its conservation. Royalties from the sales of  Searching for the Snow Leopard  support the Snow Leopard Conservancy and its programs. "

Garvin is the author of six other books on cities including,  The American City: What Works, What Doesn\u2019t , winner of the American Institute of Architects book award in urbanism and  What Makes a Great City, \u00a0published by Island Press in 2016. Unlike his other professional books, which are devoted primarily to American cities,  Beyond Sightseeing  deals with tourist destinations around the world to which Garvin travelled. The principles it sets forth are applicable to places and cities anywhere in the world. "

The significance of wash day goes far beyond hair care\u2014it\u2019s an opportunity for Black women to pour  love  into their curly, coily locks and, when they have children, pass on this sacred ritual to the next generation. \u00a0  Wash Day  celebrates the unique bonds between Black mothers and their children through intimate photographs of their hair-care routines and insightful stories that detail their natural hair journeys. Faxio brings you into the homes of twenty-six different families, illustrating the many ways that these mothers have used wash day to instill love, acceptance, and confidence in their children about wearing their natural hair. Through hours spent with their children, typically at the kitchen sink, each of these mothers is resisting generations of hair discrimination by creating a space for empowerment, all while finding their own sense of self-acceptance along the way. \u00a0 Capturing the inherent beauty and diversity of natural hair,  Wash Day  is a visual homage to Black culture, Black rituals, and the generational bonds that strengthen the Black community.

                "The inimitable, haunting films of Alfred Hitchcock took place in settings, both exterior and interior, that deeply impacted our experiences of his most unforgettable works. From the enclosed spaces of  Rope  and  Rear Window  to the wide-open expanses of  North by Northwest,  the physical worlds inhabited by desperate characters are a crucial element in our perception of the Hitchcockian universe. As Christine Madrid French reveals in this original and indispensable book, Hitchcock's relation to the built world was informed by an intense engagement with location and architectural form\u2014in an era marked by modernism's advance\u2014fueled by some of the most creative midcentury designers in film.  Hitchcock saw elements of the built world not just as scenic devices but as interactive areas to frame narrative exchanges. In his films, building forms also serve a sentient purpose\u2014to capture and convey feelings, sensations, and moments that generate an emotive response from the viewer. Visualizing the contemporary built landscape allowed the director to illuminate Americans' everyday experiences as well as their own uncertain relationship with their environment and with each other.  French shares several untold stories, such as the real-life suicide outside the Hotel Empire in  Vertigo  (which foreshadowed uncannily that film's tragic finale), and takes us to the actual buildings that served as the inspiration for  Psycho 's infamous Bates Motel. Her analysis of  North by Northwest  uncovers the Frank Lloyd Wright underpinnings for Robert Boyle's design of the modernist house from the film's celebrated Mount Rushmore sequence and ingeniously establishes the Vandamm House as the prototype of the cinematic trope of the villain's lair. She also shows how the widespread unemployment of the 1930s resulted in a surge of gifted architects transplanting their careers into the film industry. These practitioners created sets that drew from contemporary design schools of thought and referenced real structures, both modern and historic.  The Architecture of Suspense  is the first book to document how these great architectural minds found expression in Hitchcock's films and how the director used their talents and his own unique vision to create an enduring and evocative cinematic world.  Publication of this volume was assisted by a grant from Furthermore: a program of the J. M. Kaplan Fund. "

Behind-the-scenes insights explore the unique challenges of filming in these frozen worlds, where camera crew and wildlife alike brave the extreme conditions. With over 250 stunning full-colour photographs, Frozen Planet II reveals the wonders of the fastest-changing part of our planet, as we may never see them again. "

                "Round Top's African American pioneers came into Texas in 1825 when Stephen F. Austin brought in 300 Anglo-Americans, and the people they enslaved, for the purpose of colonizing the area. Soon afterward, more slaves were bought in from other slaveholding states. After the Civil War ended, the descendants of these original Round Top pioneers began building their own community. Many earned money by toiling away in the cotton fields for the very men who had once enslaved them. Others earned money working as cowboys, washerwomen, barbers, or blacksmiths. In 1867, the group founded the Concord Missionary Baptist Church as a communal space for them to come together and pool their resources to buy their own land, build their own homes, and hire teachers, which led to the creation of the Concord Missionary Baptist Church Colored School. For generations, this school successfully educated freedmen, their children, and their descendants before finally closing its doors due to desegregation. Despite many challenges, they overcame obstacles that grew into a prosperous community. "

Over the past decades, paladares\u2014or private restaurants\u2014have led a cultural and culinary renaissance in Cuba.\u00a0In P aladares , James Beard Award-winning food writer Anya von Bremzen shares a fascinating journey through the country\u2019s new food scene.\u00a0Born in Soviet Russia, Bremzen brings a unique perspective to the stories she hears from Cuba\u2019s chefs, restaurateurs, farmers, and food historians. She\u00a0eavesdrops on passionate arguments about black beans and tamales; pries Daiquir\u00ed secrets from the legendary El Floridita (Hemingway\u2019s watering hole); and guides us to vibrant markets and visionary organic farms.\u00a0  Through Bremzen\u2019s travels, we learn of Fidel\u2019s obsession with dairy cows and hear wrenching memories of privation from the time after Soviet aid vanished. We meet\u00a0colorful expats-turned-restaurateurs and local hipsters who obsess over global culture glimpsed in foreign movies and magazines.\u00a0  The more than 100 recipes in  Paladares  are as intriguing as the characters behind them. And Fawn Schlow\u2019s\u00a0evocative\u00a0photographs\u00a0frame it all with the ramshackle glamour of old Havana, Cuba\u2019s stunning countryside, dishes that are earthy and innovative, and Cuba\u2019s incredible people.

                "Ten years ago, a technological revolution swept through cinemas around the world, as analogue projectors were replaced with digital equipment. It was not just the plastic medium of film that was removed from projection boxes during this transformation; most cinemas took this opportunity to also evict the human projectionists who were hitherto in charge of screenings. Projectionists had been hidden from the sight of audiences for most of the history of photographic moving image projection, and their redundancies went largely unnoticed and unremarked upon.  This book focuses attention on what has been happening behind film spectators' heads for the past 130 years, and attempts to write the history of cinema in Britain from the perspective of its habitually overlooked and undervalued projectionists, beginning in the silent era and continuing to the present day. Drawing upon extensive archival research and lengthy interviews with former projectionists, it documents the key facets and challenges of their work, and how these evolved in response to previous waves of significant technological change. It evaluates how projectionists helped to design and maintain key aesthetic characteristics of the 20th century big screen experience. It shows how the institution of cinema in Britain has been historically underpinned by the harsh exploitation of projectionists by many employers, detailing inadequate wage levels and poor working conditions that formerly provoked government investigation, and explaining why these problems were never successfully ameliorated by trade unions. It also charts in depth the recent fateful transition to digital projection, delineating how and why projectionists were so swiftly and ruthlessly consigned to the past, and assessing whether this form of entertainment should be considered diminished by their super session.

                "Georgia is a state of great geographical diversity, and as you make your way from the Atlantic Ocean up to the temperate rainforest of the southern Appalachians, you'll find a lot to see. Thousands of meandering creeks twist and turn their way through the coastal marsh, filling and emptying its 400,000 acres twice a day with tides that can average seven feet or even higher. The largest blackwater swamp in North America is just inland, and from there you can trek north through the ever-changing scenery as the landscape transitions from the Coastal Plain to the Piedmont and finally to the Appalachian Mountains. There is plenty of beauty, including rolling farmland, intriguing barns, and stately old trees that have witnessed incredible change since Georgia's inception in 1788.    It is a place of remarkable beauty that sets a perfect scene for a landscape photographer. The Mountains, the Heartland, the South, and the Coast are gorgeous backdrops where Chris Greer captures the essence of the state in this a showcase of the splendor that is Naturally Georgia. "

                "The decisive role of U.S. Army Air Forces in North Africa is vividly chronicled in this WWII pictorial history featuring rare wartime photographs.   \u00a0  In 1942, General Erwin Rommel launched a surprise offensive in North Africa that brought a renewed threat to the Allied forces in the Middle East. United States Army Air Forces were quickly transferred to Egypt to assist the beleaguered British. Unaccustomed to the sprawling deserts of North Africa, the American airmen were confronted by sandstorms, flooding rains, extremes of temperature and primitive living conditions. Beyond these daunting conditions, they were pitted against an experienced and determined enemy.  \u00a0  U.S. air power nevertheless played a decisive role in the Allied invasion of Northwest Africa and the subsequent surrender of Axis forces in Tunisia in May 1943. Later bombing missions flown from North Africa struck Axis targets across Europe and supported the Allied invasions of Sicily and mainland Italy.  \u00a0  Featuring rare photograph from wartime archives, this volume in the Images of War series presents an illustrated account of U.S. fighter aircraft and bombers\u2014including the iconic B-17 Flying Fortress, P-38 Lightning and B-24 Liberator\u2014and the aircrews that fought to establish ascendancy over North African skies and beyond.

                "A stunning visual journey through Cambodian culture, history, art, struggle, and modernization.  Cambodia has two parallel histories. One is the constant stream of adventurers and diplomats, kings and rebels, archaeologists and artists drawn to the magnificent ruins at Angkor. Another is the formation of a nation through the Cambodian people's fierce struggles with colonialism, war, revolution, famine, and finally, the long road to recovery.  This book captures these parallel stories through the eyes of talented photographers who were present to record such events. The images, which include many rare and never-before-published photos, are drawn from archives, national collections, libraries, and private collections.  This treasure trove of nearly 500 photographs showcases the work of over 100 photographers\u2014including pioneering female photographers, Cambodian and international photographers, and some who died soon after the rise of the Khmer Rouge.  Within these pages, readers will find a fresh perspective on Cambodia. From the early days of French colonialism through the struggle for independence, and emergence into an uneasy peace in the 21st century. "

                "A powerful examination of the unsettling history of photography and its fraught relationship to global antiblackness.  Since photography\u2019s invention, black life has been presented as fraught, short, agonizingly filled with violence, and indifferent to intervention: living death\u2014 mortevivum \u2014in a series of still frames that refuse a complex humanity. In  Mortevivum , Kimberly Juanita Brown shows us how the visual logic of documentary photography and the cultural legacy of empire have come together to produce the understanding that blackness and suffering\u2014and death\u2014are inextricable. Brown traces this idea from the earliest images of the enslaved to the latest newspaper photographs of black bodies, from the United States and South Africa to Haiti and Rwanda, documenting the enduring, pernicious connection between photography and a global history of antiblackness. Photography's history, inextricably linked to colonialism and white supremacy, is a catalog of othering, surveillance, and the violence of objectification. In the genocide in Rwanda, for instance, photographs after the fact tell viewers that blackness comes with a corresponding violence that no human intervention can abate. In Haiti, the first black republic in the Western Hemisphere, photographic \u201cevidence\u201d of its sovereign failure suggests that the formerly enslaved cannot overthrow their masters and survive to tell the tale. And in South Africa and the United States, a loop of racial violence reminds black subjects of their lower-class status mandated via the state. Illustrating the global nature of antiblackness that pervades photographic archives of the present and the past,  Mortevivum  reveals how we live in a repetition of imagery signaling who lives and who dies on a gelatin silver print\u2014on a page in a book, on the cover of newspaper, and in the memory of millions.

                "This volume of rare WWII photographs offers a vivid chronicle of the exploits and operations of the famous British special forces unit stationed in Burma.   \u00a0  The Long Range Penetration Groups, more commonly known as the Chindits, were possibly the most famous fighting formations of the Second World War\u2019s Burma campaign. Colonel Orde Wingate began the operations deep within enemy territory with the aim of disrupting Japanese plans for the invasion of India.  \u00a0  In their first operation, the Chindits took the Japanese by surprise, but the Japanese responded quickly. With three brigades chasing them, they fled back to India to avoid capture. Despite heavy losses, the Chindits had proven themselves a formidable force\u2014and their next operation would be far more ambitious. Wingate arranged for 10,000 men to be flown into the heart of Burma, causing significant mayhem amongst the Japanese forces. Wingate, however, died in a plane crash in the Burmese jungle.  \u00a0  This wonderful collection of photographs, drawn in large part from one man\u2019s private albums, shows the harsh conditions in which the Chindits had to operate, and the terrible physical state of many of the men who survived the jungles, the dry plains, and the ferocious Japanese enemy.

                "\"Reveals their race across the Atlantic in stunning pictures . . . includes a first-hand account from Captain Brown of his world-first flight.\" \u2014 Daily Mail Online      It was Tuesday, 15 July 1919 and for the residents of Clifden on Ireland's west coast this was not to be a normal day. Just before 08.40 hours, descending out of the gloom, came a large, twin-engine airplane lining up for final approach. After a flight lasting 16 hours and 28 minutes, Captain John Alcock and Lieutenant Arthur Whitten-Brown had won the race to be the first to fly nonstop across the Atlantic\u2014and the prize of \u00a310,000, roughly equivalent to $1,000,000 in today's money, offered by Lord Rothermere, aviation philanthropist and owner of the  Daily Mail .    Illustrated by many unique photographs this book tells the story of the race, delayed for almost six years by the First World War. Many aircraft would be entered but few would even get off the ground. The teams faced great difficulties in preparing for the challenge of crossing one of the most hostile stretches of ocean on Earth.    The authors not only reveal tales of failures and technical difficulties, but of the intense frustration of waiting for the perfect weather-window. And even when finally airborne, Alcock and Brown's flight almost ended in disaster on several occasions as weather conditions almost conspired to cast them down into the grey, cold waters of the Atlantic and almost certain death.    \"Right from the first page, you'll be hooked . . . you're in the cockpit with Alcock and Brown and every dump and dive of the flight across the Atlantic.\" \u2014Vintage Airfix.

                "Robert Dance's new evaluation of Joan Crawford looks at her entire career and\u2014while not ignoring her early years and tempestuous personal life\u2014focuses squarely on her achievements as an actress, and as a woman who mastered the studio system with a rare combination of grit, determination, beauty, and talent. Crawford's remarkable forty-five-year motion picture career is one of the industry's longest. Signing her first contract in 1925, she was crowned an MGM star four years later and by the mid-1930s was the most popular actress in America. In the early 1940s, Crawford's risky decision to move to Warner Bros. was rewarded with an Oscar for  Mildred Pierce . This triumph launched a series of film noir classics. In her fourth decade she teamed with rival Bette Davis in  Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? , proving that Crawford, whose career had begun by defining big-screen glamour, had matured into a superb dramatic actress.  Her last film was released in 1970, and two years later she made a final television appearance, forty-seven years after walking through the MGM gate for the first time. Crawford made a successful transition into business during her later years, notably in her long association with Pepsi-Cola as a board member and the brand's leading ambassador.  Overlooked in previous biographies has been Crawford's fierce resolve in creating and then maintaining her star persona. She let neither her age nor the passing of time block her unrivaled ambition, and she continually reimagined herself, noting once that, for the right part, she would play Wally Beery's grandmother. But she was always the consummate star, and at the time of her death in 1977, she was a motion picture legend and a twentieth-century icon. "

B Michael...presents to us a portrait of a woman who was a rare gift to fashion and culture.\" \u2014  EDWARD ENNINFUL, OBE, Editor-in-Chief, British Vogue & European Editorial Director, Vogue    A poignant and glorious photographic memoir that pays homage to the lifelong friendship between the legendary Cicely Tyson and acclaimed fashion designer B Michael, who worked with her to make her gorgeous through her last bow.   What greater act of friendship is there than making someone dear look and feel their most beautiful and powerful? That was the priceless gift acclaimed designer B Michael gave to one of Hollywood's greatest actresses, Cicely Tyson over the course of their close, decades-long relationship. In this glorious four-color visual memoir packed with stunning photographs, many never before seen, B Michael recalls the bond they shared and what it was like to dress the Queen of Hollywood for all the extraordinary events of her life.  In 2005, B was summoned to create a suitable wardrobe for Ms. Tyson for a high-octane weekend hosted by Oprah Winfrey. That first successful interaction led to a nearly twenty-year-long personal and professional collaboration that defined the Hollywood star's personal aesthetic and showcased her impeccable personality and style. B was with Ms. Tyson for the most glamorous times\u2014the Academy Awards, the Emmy Awards, White House functions, glittering galas, high-profile funerals\u2014as well as the tenderest days. Their circle included a who's who of Black celebrities, including Sidney Poitier, Barack Obama, Common, Whitney Houston, Beyonc\u00e9, Lenny Kravitz, Viola Davis, Oprah, Tyler Perry, Valerie Simpson, Phylicia Rashad, and many more, most of whom are featured in personal and paparazzi photographs in these pages.  Throughout their time together, B and Cicely enjoyed shocking the fashionistas, shattering inane rules limiting what a woman of a certain age should wear, devoted themselves to changing the world for the better through philanthropic efforts, laughed, cried, and inspired and celebrated each other's excellence. In this stunning book featuring studio photos, candids from the author's personal collection, and paparazzi shots, B shares every aspect of their time together\u2014from the drama of a good sleeve to how to be the best friend possible to those we love.  Whether you're a fan of pop culture, couture, Hollywood, B, or Cicely Tyson, Muse is a reminder that we all have the power to be showstoppers in our own lives.  Includes written contributions from Lenny Kravitz, Bridget Foley, Susan Fales Hill, and Valerie Simpson. "

For almost a century, movie fans have been riveted by the Academy Awards and the stars who have won Oscars.  50 Oscar Nights  takes readers behind the scenes of Hollywood\u2019s most storied awards show through new and exclusive interviews with dozens of A-list actors, filmmakers, and craftspeople spanning sixty years of the Oscars. Here these artists reflect on their winning work and recount all the details of how they got ready, how they felt when they heard their name and got up on stage to accept their award, what they wore, how the entire experience impacted their life, and more.  Some interviews bring to light fun stories like why Hilary Swank decided to celebrate her Academy Award at the Astro Burger in West Hollywood, or insight into the work as Elton John explains why he was convinced he won his Best Original Song award for the wrong tune. Other interviews illuminate why for some honorees, such as Julia Roberts, John Legend, and Octavia Spencer, the day remains a life highlight to be treasured, while for Marlee Matlin, Mira Sorvino, and Barry Jenkins, complex emotions cloud what most think would be a purely celebratory moment.  Filled with more than 150 photos of red-carpet moments, emotional acceptances, and after-party play,  50 Oscar Nights  is both a stunning record of cinema glamour and a must-read for any movie lover.  \u00a0  Full list of interviewees:  Nicole Kidman, Elton John, Jennifer Hudson, Steven Spielberg, Jane Fonda, Barry Jenkins, Halle Berry, J.

                "A comprehensive history of the development and use of cameras in recording British military conflicts from the 1850s to the 1950s.  Books about war and the pictures that came out of conflict usually concentrate on the picture content. But behind every picture there is a camera\u2014and that's what this book is about. Profusely illustrated throughout with pictures of the cameras, rather than the pictures they took, it looks at one hundred years of conflict from the Crimean War to the Korean War. It begins in the days when a photographer needed to be more of a scientist than an artist, such were the difficulties of shooting and processing any photograph. It ends with the cameras whose compact dimensions, versatility and ease of use meant that photographers could largely forget the science and concentrate on the art. Some cameras simply recorded events. Others defined and changed the way those events proceeded. These were the cameras that went to war, and this is their story.  Praise for  Cameras at War    \"An amazing collection of superb photographs beginning with some from the Crimean War\u2014coupled with a brilliant narrative that emphasizes the use of photography to record conflict. Where would we be without such evidentiary mementoes?\" \u2014 Books Monthly  (UK) "

                "Through the use of novel photographic techniques the author gives us an 'insect-eye view' of the world of flying insects. By presenting them in the wider landscape they inhabit, rather than at the end of a close-up lens, the author reinforces the view that even relatively 'simple' animals like insects share the same world as human beings. This theme chimes with current thinking about conservation and the importance of diversity in the natural environment. Mastery of the air is the supreme achievement of the evolution of insects and the images bring the viewer closer than ever to an experience of the 'action'. The visual framework forms a convenient basis for discussing some of the ecological, behavioural, and physiological aspects of flight in accessible non-technical language. "

The Second Half  explores, in photographic portraits and interviews, how the second half of life is experienced by women from many different cultures. From a French actress to a British novelist, from an Algerian nomad to a Saudi Arabian doctor, and an American politician, Ellen Warner traveled all over the world to interview women about their lives. She asked them what they learned in the first half that was helpful in the second, and what advice they would give to younger women. Their revealing and inspiring stories are enlightening for all readers, and are illustrated by Warner's stunning portraits which tell their own story. "

The violence erupted due to strikes on Louisiana sugar cane plantations. Fear, rumor and white supremacist ideals clashed with an unprecedented labor action to create an epic tragedy. A future member of the U.S. House of Representatives was among the leaders of a mob that routed black men from houses and forced them to a stretch of railroad track, ordering them to run for their lives before gunning them down. According to a witness, the guns firing in the black neighborhoods sounded like a battle. Author and award-winning reporter John DeSantis uses correspondence, interviews and federal records to detail this harrowing true story. "

As the whaling boom diminished, religious revivalism and then tourism brought more and more summer visitors. By the twentieth century, the now familiar yearly cycle of quiet winters alternating with enormous bursts of activity and population in the summers was well established.  \u00a0  Bonnie Stacy, chief curator of the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Museum, has selected images from the museum\u2019s extensive photograph collection to illustrate the history of the island. This collection, donated through the generosity of islanders and visitors over the course of more than ninety years, represents an invaluable record of the Vineyard from the 1840s to the present day.

                "A striking portrait of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her historic tenure on the United States Supreme Court, brought to life with incisive quotes and bold photographs of her iconic collars.    \u201cRBG was unlike any other. So is this visual tribute to her.\u201d\u2014Pete Souza, #1  New York Times  bestselling author of  Obama: An Intimate Portrait     A  PARADE  BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR  The collar is a powerful point of entry for exploring Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s life and her tireless work on America\u2019s highest court. The twenty-five neckpieces captured here\u2014in over eighty stunning photographs by award-winning photographer Elinor Carucci\u2014hoffer insight into RBG\u2019s legacy. Her sharp use of language, a linchpin of her notorious dissents, is celebrated throughout, with quotes to support each collar and its story. The bold, ornate, and subversive collars she chose to wear on the bench communicated so much more.\u00a0 Shortly after RBG\u2019s passing in September, 2020, Carucci was commissioned by  Time  magazine for a commemorative piece on the late justice, focused on the stories behind her legendary collars. Here, Carucci and co-author Sara Bader use each collar to highlight a defining career moment, from RBG\u2019s earliest argument for gender equality to her support of immigration and marriage equality throughout her twenty-seven years on the bench. Some of her collars are well-known, like her dissent collar, or her favorite white beaded neckpiece that she wore for important portraits. Other collars are less familiar but tell poignant stories of artists, colleagues, friends, and fans whose gifts to Justice Ginsburg found meaning in her hands. Small in stature but towering in influence, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was described as a titan, a civil rights hero, and most poetically, by her colleague Justice Stephen Breyer, \u201ca rock of righteousness.\u201d  The Collars of RBG  is an artful collection of moments from this warrior\u2019s legacy, crystallizing the many ways RBG reshaped the cultural landscape for us all.

                "Wild Lives  presents a celebration of the beauty, ferocity, and revival of Earth's endangered wildlife through the lens of legendary photographer Art Wolfe.   Wild Lives  is a celebration of the extraordinary diversity of species that inhabit the planet. Some are common, some rare, and many are conservation success stories, species that have been brought back from the edge of extinction. Over his forty-year career, Art Wolfe has photographed many species that were once on endangered species lists, but are now flourishing (such as the bald eagle and humpback whale). These recoveries are an uplifting testament to the resilience of life when it is given a chance.    From amphibians and reptiles to mammals and birds,  Wild Lives  portrays an earthly aesthetic millions of years in the making. Wolfe has photographed more than 500 species in 60 countries, and the never-before-seen work in Wild forms his most comprehensive, globe-spanning book of photography he has ever published.    Accompanying Wolfe's photos are essays by renowned conservationist, Gregory Green. Focusing on the why of wildlife conservation and recovery, Green discusses the redistribution of animals and their habitats dating all the way back to the Ice Age.    Together, Wolfe and Green have crafted a monograph that will not only shed new light on the creatures that surround us, but on humanity as a species as well. "
