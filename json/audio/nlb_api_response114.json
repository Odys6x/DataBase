What happens when there's no room at the inn and you and your potentially demonic cat become roommates with your grumpy one-night stand?  Part-time adult film actress/one-time adult film director/makeup artist Sunny Palmer has accidentally sold her very first screenplay to the Hope Channel. That was six months ago. Fast forward to a looming deadline, an uninspired Sunny has returned to the source of her inspiration in Christmas Notch, Vermont, to immerse herself in the local Christmas miracle on which her fever dream of a movie pitch was based.  Isaac Kelly, former boy band heartthrob and the saddest boy in the music biz, is the latest owner of the town's historic mansion. After his years of heartbreak following his young wife's death, Isaac's record label is done waiting for new music. What better place to attempt his first holiday album than a snow-covered mansion where he can become a hermit in peace?  But after their best friends' wedding leads to them waking up together in a freezing motel room with questionable wiring and a broken shower, Isaac takes a chance and asks Sunny to stay with him at his home. Surely the place is big enough that he'll hardly see her or her unhinged cat. But when the two discover they're both creatively blocked, they make a handshake deal: Isaac will help Sunny hunt down the truth behind the local lore, and Sunny will find Isaac a new muse.  And with these two opposites under one roof, there's no way this jingle bell mingle could go off script...right?. "

Years later, she's perhaps the most hated\u2014and least understood\u2014woman in music. She was never as popular with fans as her bandmate (and soulmate), Elijah Hart\u2014even if Jane was the one who wrote the songs that catapulted the Lightning Bottles to instant, dizzying fame, first in the Seattle grunge scene, then around the world.   But ever since Elijah disappeared five years earlier and the band's meteoric rise to fame came crashing down, the public hatred of Jane has taken on new levels, and all she wants to do is retreat. What she doesn't anticipate is the bombshell that awaits her at her new home in the German countryside: the sullen teenaged girl next door\u2014a Lightning Bottles superfan\u2014who claims to have proof that not only is Elijah still alive, he's also been leaving secret messages for Jane. And they need to find them right away.   A cross-continent road trip about two misunderstood outsiders brought together by their shared love of music,  The Lightning Bottles  is both a love letter to the 90s and a searing portrait of the cost of fame.

For a gardener blessed with a green thumb, Savannah Collins's life sure seems like it's all thorns, zero roses. She has no job, no relationship, and no place to live. With nothing but a car full of plants and her new rescue kitten, Savannah heads to Bloom, North Carolina, to spend the summer with her beloved Aunt Eleanor, a retired librarian.  Her aunt shares her love of literature with the Finders Keepers Library, located in her beautiful garden, where anyone can stop by to pick a book or leave a book. When a sudden summer storm destroys the library and many of the roses, it will take a village to get everything ready for the garden wedding that is planned there in just three weeks.  As the entire town joins in to make the necessary repairs, Savannah bonds with their neighbor Evan Sanders over the books that Eleanor has handpicked for each of them, helping them both find healing and self-discovery. Savannah only intends to stay through the summer, but when an unexpected job offer, a sudden health crisis, and a wayward pre-teen push her future in new directions, she has to wonder whether this is the place that she is meant to be\u2014and the family she's meant to be with.

Honoria Hartley enjoys flirting far too much to consider marrying. And besides, she's been betrothed since birth to the long-lost Viscount Vandemere. But no one has actually ever met the viscount and, without an heir, the title will soon become extinct. So she's willing to do anything to keep her viscount alive, even if she has to invent him herself.  Oscar Flint is a first-rate gambler. Estranged from his father's side of the family his entire life, he grew up beneath the tutelage of a legendary con artist. There isn't anyone who could pull the wool over his eyes. Not until he crosses paths with Honoria. Losing to her puts him in a bind... Until he remembers her story about a lost heir to a viscountcy. An heir that no one has ever met. Not yet, anyway.  When Oscar arrives on Honoria's doorstep, claiming to be Vandemere, she is thrown for a loop. This rogue is not her viscount. The only problem is, he's quite convincing, and when he kisses her, the line between the lie and the truth becomes hazy in all the steam they create. Honoria refuses to gamble with her heart. But Oscar has never played by the rules and he's determined to win, no matter the cost. "

So when she, her mother, and her sister move from Nigeria to America shortly after her father's death, she wants to be extremely prepared before attending an American high school. Her cousin, Adrian, doesn't have time to explain the ins and outs to her but, luckily, he recommends the perfect research tool: teen movies.  Still dealing with grief but armed with a set of rules of survival gathered from these movies (including the crucial rule of keeping a low profile), Enore is ready for her senior year. But when she meets Davi Santiago, it may be much harder than she thought to keep to her rules. Because not only is he super thoughtful (and okay, very good looking), he constantly encourages her to share her incredible singing talent. Enore prefers the background but it just might be time for her to take center stage, even in spite of her mother's strict expectations.   Maybe it would be easier to follow all the rules, the ones Enore set for herself and the ones her mom imposes, but as every teen movie has taught her, a coming-of-age is nothing without a little rebellion. And with help from her crush, her sister, and some new friends who don't quite fit the roles she expects them to play, Enore's senior year might indeed be cinematic.

I devoured this fake dating, celebrity chef romance.\"  \u2014 Erin La Rosa, author of  Plot Twist  and  For Butter or Worse     Business or Pleasure  meets  Evvie Drake Starts Over  in this delicious opposites-attract romance from debut author Sarah Chamberlain.    Sometimes the perfect recipe just needs a little extra heat.  Ellie Wasserman's life is neat and tidy, and that's exactly how she wants it. Really. A top ghostwriter for celebrity cookbooks, she was widowed three years ago and has no interest in taking chances\u2014not on writing her own cookbook, not on telling her still-grieving in-laws she wants to move out, and certainly not on dating, which is about as intimidating as a recipe with fifty steps. Kieran O'Neill isn't known for being organized. An up-and-coming chef who scored big on a reality television competition, he's been the guy who cracks jokes and makes messes\u2014something his chilly family has never let him forget. The only place he feels truly capable is at the stove. But when he's paired with an uptight ghostwriter with cool blue eyes and distracting curves to write his debut cookbook, she shreds his class clown act like a paring knife cuts an orange peel. As Ellie and Kieran are forced to work closely together in a hot kitchen for weeks on end, their sharp edges and harsh judgments slowly soften and sweeten into a wildly delicious attraction. Long, steamy days turn into even steamier nights, but they have to face their painful pasts to know if this tender new love can transform into something lasting.  \"A romance as sharp as it is sweet. Fans of Emily Henry will devour this delectable story of love lost and found.\"  \u2014 Cecilia Rabess   A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

Sienna Naples's family has taken care of their wild Idaho land for generations and Sienna can't imagine any other life. But at Christmastime, with her parents gone and her painful marriage finally over, it's full of memories... and incredibly lonely. Until a tall, handsome stranger and a little girl walk into her life and suddenly the holidays are alive again.   When single father Guy Maple shows up as the result of an ad meant to be a joke, the handsome Montana construction worker isn't joking. Money is tight this Christmas, and Guy's four-year-old daughter Emma has stage-five chronic kidney disease. She needs a kidney transplant, but if Guy can't prove that he can afford Emma's anti-rejection medications, his daughter isn't going to stay on the transplant list.

Georgina decides to get back at her sister and shock the Viscountess by kissing the first willing stranger she meets in the enchanting gardens of Anya House. Unfortunately, her sister is not the sole witness. A group of reporters and the ton's leading gossips catch Georgina in a passionate embrace with a reticent composer, Lord Mark Sebastian. The third son of an influential marquis, the tongue-tied Mark is determined to keep the scandal from ruining Georgina's reputation and his own prospects of winning the celebrated Harlbert's Prize for music. Under the guise of private voice lessons, the two embark on a daring gamble to fool the ton into believing that their feigned courtship is honorable while bolstering Georgina's singing genius to captivate potential suitors. Sexist cartoons, family rivalries, and an upcoming ball test the fake couple's resolve. Will their sudden fiery collaboration-and growing attraction-prove there's nothing false about a first kiss and scandalously irresistible temptation?. "

He offers her love, respect, and a life beyond the strict bounds of the East German society in which she was raised \u2014 which she longs to leave more than anything. But only two short days after their engagement, Lise and Uli are torn violently apart when barbed wire is rolled across Berlin, splitting the city into two hostile halves: capitalist West Berlin, an island of western influence isolated far beyond the iron curtain; and the socialist East, a country determined to control its citizens by any means necessary.  Soon, Uli and his friends in West Berlin hatch a plan to get Lise and her unborn child out of East Germany, but as distance and suspicion bleed into their lives and as weeks turn to months, how long can true love survive in the divided city?.

As the snow gets deeper and the stakes get higher, every clue will bring Maggie and Ethan closer to the truth\u2014and each other. Because, this Christmas, these two rivals are going to have to become allies (and maybe more) if they have any hope of saving Eleanor.  Assuming they don't kill each other first. "

Outsiders in a world of power and privilege. And, according to everyone else, we were dangerous.  It would have made our lives a lot easier if Marta had simply pushed our prefect Genevieve out of our bedroom window that day. Certainly, it would have been tragic. She would have died instantly.  But Marta didn't push her then, or \u2013 if you choose to believe me \u2013 at any other time. If she had, all of what we went through would not have happened.  I've told this story as clearly as I could \u2013 as rationally as I've been able, in the circumstances, to achieve. I don't regret what we did. And I would do it all again. "

                "New York Times bestselling author Sophie Jordan returns to the high-stakes, sweeping world of dragons, romance, and drama first evoked in her bestselling young adult Firelight series, in a brand-new epic adult romantasy series.    Dragons are extinct. Witches are outcast. Magic is dying.    But human lust for power is immortal.   Dragon fire no longer blisters the skies over Penterra, but inside the lavish palace, life is still perilous...especially for Tamsyn. Raised in the glittering court alongside the princesses, it's her duty to be punished for their misdeeds. Treated as part of the royal family but also as the lowliest servant, Tamsyn fits nowhere. Her only friend is Stig, Captain of the Guard...though sometimes she thinks he wants more than friendship.   When Fell, the Beast of the Borderlands, descends on her home, Tamsyn's world becomes even more dangerous. To save the pampered princesses from a fate worse than death, she is commanded to don a veil and marry the brutal warrior. She agrees to the deception even though it means leaving Stig, and the only life she's ever known, behind.  The wedding night begins with unexpected passion\u2014and ends in near violence when her trickery is exposed. Rather than start a war, Fell accepts Tamsyn as his bride...but can he accept the dark secrets she harbors\u2014secrets buried so deep even she doesn't know they exist? For Tamsyn is more than a royal whipping girl, more than the false wife of a man who now sees her as his enemy. And when those secrets emerge, they will ignite a flame bright enough to burn the entire kingdom to the bone.   Magic is not dead...it is only sleeping. And it will take one ordinary girl with an extraordinary destiny to awaken it. "

Taking a bullet in the shoulder, she manages to escape and make her way to her half-sister Jane. Hidden away in the mountain fortress of the mysterious Dreagan Industries, Sammi finds more than a safe haven. She finds Tristan-the most gorgeous, beguiling, and haunted man she has ever known... Newest of the Dragon Kings, Tristan fell from the sky in a snowstorm naked with a sword-but with no memories of his ancient struggles. When he meets the wounded Sammi, something powerful stirs within his heart. When he sees the dragon symbol etched into the bullet from her shoulder, something fierce burns within his soul. With his darkest enemies closing in, Tristan must take wing, take sides-and take no prisoners-to save the woman he's destined to love. "

Having established a queendom of her own, she is ready to do whatever is necessary to save her people from starvation and seek vengeance against her father.

Expect a rogue's gallery of villains including an axe wielding maid, a shining knight with dark moods, a homicidal bodyguard, and a playboy spymaster with a golden heart and a filthy reputation.     When her whole life collapsed, Rae still had books. Dying, she seizes a second chance at living: a magical bargain that lets her enter the world of her favorite fantasy series.    She wakes in a castle on the edge of a hellish chasm, in a kingdom on the brink of war. Home to dangerous monsters, scheming courtiers and her favourite fictional character: the Once and Forever Emperor. He's impossibly alluring, as only fiction can be. And in this fantasy world, she discovers she's not the heroine, but the villainess in the Emperor's tale.    So be it. The wicked are better dressed, with better one-liners, even if they're doomed to bad ends. She assembles the wildly disparate villains of the story under her evil leadership, plotting to change their fate. But as the body count rises and the Emperor's fury increases, it seems Rae and her allies may not survive to see the final page.  THIS IS A TALE FOR EVERYONE WHO'S EVER FALLEN FOR THE VILLAIN... "

But when his favorite hometown librarian, Ms. Barnes, dies, he must return to New Crosshaven for her funeral and for the summer. Too bad being home makes it a lot harder to avoid facing his ex\u2013best friend, Tiwa Olatunji, or facing the daunting task of telling his Bangladeshi parents that he would rather be an artist than a doctor. Tiwa doesn't understand what made Said start ignoring her, but it's probably that fancy boarding school of his. Though he's unexpectedly staying at home through the summer, she's determined to take a page from him and pretend he doesn't exist. Besides, she has more than enough going on anyway, between grieving her broken family and helping her mother throw the upcoming Eid celebration at the Islamic Center\u2014a place that means so much to Tiwa. But when the Islamic Center accidentally catches fire, it turns out the mayor plans to demolish the center entirely. Things are still tense between the ex-friends, but Tiwa needs Said's help if there's any hope of changing the mayor's mind, and on top of everything, Said needs a project to submit to art school (unbeknownst to anyone).  Will all their efforts be enough to save the Islamic Center, save Eid, and maybe even save their relationship?  A Macmillan Audio production from Feiwel & Friends. "

Magic is fading from Wales\u2014choked off by King Offa's Dyke, the enemy earthworks that spans the entire border. Even the dragons have disappeared. And now an attack is imminent.

So when Prince Taliesin arrives, begrudgingly seeking a witch's aid, Ffion agrees to help him\u2014even if it means walking from one end of Wales to the other with the most use-less peacock she's ever clapped eyes on. Even if it means striking a bargain with Dafydd behind Tal's back. The fate of Wales depends on their quest . . . and so might the fate of Ffion's heart. "

                "\"A steamy game of cat and mouse between witch and witch-hunter, played out against a backdrop of opulence, secrets, and bloody history. I couldn't look away.\" - Kendare Blake, #1  New York Times  bestselling author of  Champion of Fate    Enemies-to-lovers doesn't get more high stakes than a witch and a witch hunter falling in love in bestselling author Kristen Ciccarelli's latest romantic fantasy  On the night Rune\u2019s life changed forever, blood ran in the streets. Now, in the aftermath of a devastating revolution, witches have been diminished from powerful rulers to outcasts ruthlessly hunted due to their waning magic, and Rune must hide what she is. Spending her days pretending to be nothing more than a vapid young socialite, Rune spends her nights as the Crimson Moth, a witch vigilante who rescues her kind from being purged. When a rescue goes wrong, she decides to throw the witch hunters off her scent and gain the intel she desperately needs by courting the handsome Gideon Sharpe - a notorious and unforgiving witch hunter loyal to the revolution - who she can't help but find herself falling for. Gideon loathes the decadence and superficiality Rune represents, but when he learns the Crimson Moth has been using Rune\u2019s merchant ships to smuggle renegade witches out of the republic, he inserts himself into her social circles by pretending to court her right back. He soon realizes that beneath her beauty and shallow fa\u00e7ade, is someone fiercely intelligent and tender who feels like his perfect match. Except, what if she\u2019s the very villain he\u2019s been hunting? Kristen Ciccarelli\u2019s  Heartless Hunter  is the thrilling start to a romantic fantasy duology where the only thing more treacherous than being a witch...is falling in love.  \u201cEnchanting and deeply romantic,  Heartless Hunter  drew me in with the first sentence and left me breathless by the last. A story that unfolds like a spell, and one that is destined to capture your heart.\u201d - Rebecca Ross,  New York Times  bestselling author of  Divine Rivals. "

The only job he can find is as a physician in the backwaters of Wales where he can't speak the language, belief in myth and magic is rife, and the villagers treat him with bewildering suspicion. When Henry discovers his predecessor died under mysterious circumstances, he is determined to find answers. Linette Tresilian, the unconventional mistress of Plas Helyg, lives a lonely life. Her father is long dead, her mother haunted by demons which keep her locked away in her room, and her cousin treats her with cool disdain - she has had no choice but to become fiercely self-reliant. Linette has always suspected something is not quite right in the village, but it is only through Henry's investigations that the truth about those closest to her will come to light...a truth that will bind hers and Henry's destinies together in ways neither thought possible.

                "A woman leaves her coastal Greenland village to translate the works of a renowned Proven\u00e7al poet and finds her life irrevocably changed, in this tender and romantic novel set in a French village. \u201cA charming and beautifully written novel about self-discovery, the power of language, and yes, love!\u201d\u2014Sara Gruen, author of  Water for Elephants   Ilse Erlund is a translator who lives in a house on stilts along the west coast of Greenland. Isolated and restless in her world by the sea, she convinces her publisher to pay for a trip to the country she has never visited but whose language she speaks fluently: France. Her mission is to translate the verses of Geoffrey \u201cPo\u201d Labaye, a charismatic poet known as \u201cthe last living troubadour of Provence.\u201d Upon arrival in the medieval hilltop village of Belle Rivi\u00e8re, Ilse falls under the spell of the Proven\u00e7al way of life, captivated by the air, the sun, the vibrant spring colors, and the dulcet sounds of the dialect. Soon enough, Ilse is captivated by the poet, too, and she and Po develop a daily rhythm and warm camaraderie\u2014which is disrupted by the arrival of the poet\u2019s son, Frey. Though he has a fianc\u00e9e back in Paris, Frey turns his attentions to Ilse, and suddenly she is forced to learn  another  language, one her translation skills have not prepared her to decode. Where\u2014and with whom\u2014does her future lie? With an eye and ear attuned to the sensibilities of French life, Elizabeth Birkelund has created a love story about a woman forced to choose between the security of her quiet northern home and the possibility of the life of her dreams.

                "Inspired by the temporary shuttering of Powell's Books in Portland, Oregon, City of Books explores a bibliophile's fantasy: moving into a bookstore to stop it from closing.    Jo Waterstone knows what you should read next. She's honed the skill of sizing up a person and recommending their next book in the decades she's worked at Bruebaker's Books. Her life has been shaped by the store, the bustle of customers exploring the stacks, and managing the eager staff. She can honestly say it's the best job she's ever had.  Then the store's elderly owner, Mr. Bruebaker, suffers a stroke, and just like that Jo's perfect job is on the chopping block. Mr. B's daughters and the bookstore's icy CEO think the time is right to close for good, and they order Jo to lock up. But she doesn't know what she would be without Bruebaker's\u2014and besides, the place is an institution. So instead of following orders, she decides to take a stand: along with a few brave team members, she barricades herself in the store, trying to buy time until Mr. Bruebaker recovers and can speak for himself.   Living in a bookstore has a certain magic to it, but the quiet hours among the books throw the choices Jo has made in her life into sharp relief. As supporters (and detractors) start to voice their opinions about her actions, Jo will have to decide what, exactly, is worth saving. "

                "A fast-paced, completely delightful new mystery about what happens when parents get a little too involved in their kids' schools, from NAACP Image Award nominee Elise Bryant.  Mavis Miller is  not  a PTA mom. She has enough on her plate with her feisty seven-year-old daughter, Pearl, an exhausting job at a nonprofit, and the complexities of a multigenerational household. So no one is more surprised than Mavis when she caves to Trisha Holbrook, the long-reigning, slightly terrifying PTA president, and finds herself in charge of the school\u2019s brand-new DEI committee. As one of the few Black parents at this California elementary school, Mavis  tries  to convince herself this is an opportunity for real change. But things go off the rails at the very first meeting, when the new principal's plans leave Trisha absolutely  furious . Later that night, when Mavis spies Trisha in yellow rubber gloves and booties, lugging cleaning supplies and giant black trash bags to her waiting minivan, it\u2019s only natural that her mind jumps to somewhere it surely wouldn\u2019t in the light of day. Except Principal Smith fails to show up for work the next morning, and has been MIA since the meeting. Determined to get to the bottom of things, Mavis, along with the school psychologist with the great forearms (look, it\u2019s worth noting), launches an investigation that will challenge her views on parenting, friendship, and elementary school politics. Brilliantly written,  It's Elementary  is a\u00a0quick-witted, escapist romp that perfectly captures just how far parents will go to give their kids the very best, all wrapped in a mystery that will leave you guessing to the very end.

                "A hockey player and a baker shoot their shot in this steamy new romance by Lana Ferguson,  USA Today  bestselling author of  The Nanny.   When a very public breakup becomes a PR nightmare for Ian Chase's team, he hopes to focus on his game, but that suddenly seem less likely than a hat trick. With his career and the team\u2019s image in jeopardy, Ian is surprised to find a solution through none other than Delilah Baker, his best friend and teammate's little sister\u2026who isn\u2019t so little anymore. Delilah Baker is known as \u201cthe darling of baking\u201d on her local cable show, and being in the public eye is her bread and butter. But with her numbers dwindling and her producers turning up the heat, Delilah offers up the half-baked idea to collaborate with her brother\u2019s team to entice the hockey fans of Boston to tune in to her show. Delilah thinks it will be a piece of cake\u2014until the team sends Ian Chase, her brother\u2019s best friend and the object of a decade-long crush that she\u2019s never quite gotten over.\u00a0 Delilah's and Ian\u2019s teams think it\u2019s a true win-win situation\u2014gaining higher numbers for Delilah\u2019s show and casting Ian in a more positive light. And viewers are eating them up like a cupcake, sparking the idea to play up their relationship for the goal of good press. With more than just their careers on thin ice, the line between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s for show begins to blur, but one thing\u2019s for certain: This PR stunt will either be a total game changer\u2014or leave them both totally pucked.

It hasn't as of yet but I still have reasons to believe that was true. 'I loved it, I loved it, I loved it!' Dawn O'Porter 'Very funny. I Love You, I Love You, I Love You bursts with energy.' Matt Haig 'A spectacular, funny portrayal of being young and in love.' Woman & Home 'A brilliant, nostalgic read.' Closer 'An ode to the bittersweet feeling of first love.' Woman's Own \u2764 \u2764 \u2764 Ella and Lowe are teenagers when they first meet in summer 2000. For her, it's love at first sight. But it's safest to love from afar, where the friendship zone is her safety net and she can't get hurt. Certain that the most beautiful boy she's ever seen couldn't possibly feel the same, Ella counts herself lucky to have him as her best friend. Over the next fifteen years they share everything: bottles of cider and cigarettes in the rain, gossip and laughter, grief and fear. But every time Lowe kisses another girl, Ella feels her heart break just that little bit more. She'll have to choose whether it's enough to be just friends with the love of her life, or if she's prepared to let the terrifying, beautiful, all-consuming truth come to light. From a unique new voice in adult fiction, I Love You, I Love You, I Love You is a glorious nostalgia trip for anyone who has ever known the exquisite pain and pleasure of first love. \u2764 \u2764 \u2764 'So visceral, nostalgic, mucky, heartbreaking and bittersweet.

But when she's sent on assignment to help a struggling family-run tour company in the Highlands - and save her own job - Addie packs away her emotional baggage and turns on the professional charm. Rugged as the land he loves, Logan Sutherland's greatest joy is sharing the beauty of Scotland's hidden gems . . . even if it means a wee bit of red ink on the company's bottom line. The last thing Logan wants is some American 'expert' pushing tourist traps and perpetuating myths about the Loch Ness Monster - especially when Addie never leaves her desk to experience the country for herself. As they wage an office war, Logan discovers Addie's secret connection to Scotland: a handful of faded Polaroids of her late mother. Hoping for a truce, he creates a private tour to the places in the pictures to help Addie find closure and appreciate the enchantment in less-traveled destinations, never expecting the off-limits attraction sparking between them. But Addie's contract is almost up, and magic won't pay the bills. They can't afford distractions, but how can Addie do her job if she hasn't explored all Scotland - and Logan - have to offer?. "

Elliot Owen is handsome, charming and basically Hollywood royalty. And, he insists, madly in love with Edie Thompson: an ordinary citizen with Pret tomato soup stains on her coat. It's going to be complicated. Edie will have to learn how to live in the limelight, but they're just too good together not to try. Edie discovers it's not easy when the press is the third person in your relationship, or when stories start leaking that force you to mistrust the motives of those around you.

It's harder still when your past is raked up by envious people determined to destroy your present.

Natalie and Rob couldn\u2019t have less in common. Nat\u2019s a messy artist, and Rob\u2019s a rigid academic. The only thing they share is their devotion to their respective best friends\u2014who just got engaged. Still, unexpected chemistry has Natalie cautiously optimistic about being maid of honor to Rob\u2019s best man. Until, minutes before the ceremony, Nat learns that Rob wrote a one-star review of her new novel, which has them both reeling: Nat from imposter syndrome, and Rob over the reason he needed to write it. When the reception ends, these two opposites hope they\u2019ll never meet again. But, as they slip from their twenties into their thirties, they\u2019re forced together whenever their fast-track best friends celebrate another milestone. Through housewarmings and christenings, life-changing triumphs and failures, Natalie and Rob grapple with their own choices\u2014and how your harshest critic can become your perfectly imperfect match. After all, even the truest love stories sometimes need a bit of rewriting. "

Daphne Brink doesn\u2019t follow baseball, but watching \u201cAmerica\u2019s Snoozefest\u201d certainly beats sitting at home in the days after she signs her divorce papers. After one too many ballpark beers, she heckles Carolina Battery player Chris Kepler, who quickly proves there might  actually  be a little crying in baseball.

When a DM from \u201cDuckie\u201d catches his eye, he impulsively messages back. Duckie is sweet, funny, and seems to understand him in a way no one else does.  Daphne isn\u2019t sure how much longer she can keep lying to Chris, especially as she starts working with the team in real life and\u00a0their feelings for each other deepen. When he finds out the truth, will it be three strikes, she\u2019s out?. "

Reader review When you can't find the perfect date for the holidays you hire him! Hotshot lawyer Rebecca Madison is dreading the annual family Thanksgiving break where the question on everyone's lips will be 'why are you still single?'. When it comes to her career, she's the best of the best, hired for her take-no-prisoners approach and sharp instincts. But when it comes to her love life...well, she hasn't found the loophole for happy ever after yet. So when she has a one night stand with a gorgeous stranger she meets in a bar, Becca decides to do what she does best: make a deal with Mr One Night to be her Mr Right (just for the holidays). With an iron-clad contract setting out the terms for their fake relationship, Becca has one important point. Clause 1.a. No kissing, no sex (as mind-blowing as it was), and absolutely no emotional attachment! But five thousand miles from home and spending every waking moment in the company of a man who makes her feel things she's never felt before, just how easy will it be for Becca to stick to her own rules...

Joy Blackwood has no idea why her French art dealer husband has left a valuable painting to a woman called Robyn Tessier in Ballycove, a small town on the west coast of Ireland, but she is determined to find out.

As Joy becomes entangled in the daily dramas of Ballycove, uncovering the secrets behind her husband's painting grows increasingly challenging. When she finally musters the courage to confront the truth, her revelation sends shockwaves through the tight-knit community she's grown to love.  PRAISE FOR FAITH HOGAN:  'Utterly enchanting!

Seventeen-year-old Olivia Owens isn't thrilled that her dad's getting remarried...again. She's especially not thrilled that he cheated on her mom, kicked them out of their Rhode Island home, and cut Olivia out of her rightful inheritance.  But this former heiress has a plan for revenge. While hundreds of guests gather on the grounds of the gorgeous estate where she grew up, everyone will be thinking romance\u2014not robbery. She'll play the part of dutiful daughter, but in reality she'll be redistributing millions from her father's online accounts. She only needs the handwritten pass code he keeps in the estate's safe.  With the help of an eclectic crew of high school students and one former teacher, Olivia has plotted her mid-nuptial heist down to the second. But she didn't plan for an obnoxiously nosy wedding guest, an interfering ex-boyfriend intent on winning her back, greedy European cousins with their own agenda, or a vengeful second wife. When everything seems like it's going wrong, Olivia has to keep her eyes on what really matters: getting rich. And when she's done, \"something borrowed\" will be the understatement of the year. "

                "***Hannah Dolby's latest instalment of the adventures of Lady Detective Violet Hamilton is available for pre-order now!***      Violet Hamilton is no ordinary lady...  She is a Lady Detective, who spends her time solving mysteries and unveiling scandals in the bustling seaside town of Hastings and St Leonards, a popular spot for the Victorian middle classes. But when the body of a local woman is found on the beach, Violet's efforts to investigate are blocked at every turn. Is that because, as a woman, she can't possibly be allowed to think or act for herself? Or is it because someone sinister has Violet in their sights?  Jane Austen meets Sherlock Holmes in this delightful mystery of manners that will steal your heart, and transport you to a world of seaside scandal and moonlit balls; dubious doctors and duplicitous crooked lords; adventurous escapades and stolen kisses.

A forbidden, secret affair proves that all\u2019s fair in love and science\u2014from  New York Times  bestselling author Ali Hazelwood.  Rue Siebert might not have it  all , but she has  enough : a few friends she can always count on, the financial stability she yearned for as a kid, and a successful career as a biotech engineer at Kline, one of the most promising start-ups in the field of food science. Her world is stable, pleasant, and hard-fought. Until a hostile takeover and its offensively attractive front man threatens to bring it all crumbling down.  Eli Killgore and his business partners want Kline, period. Eli has his own reasons for pushing this deal through\u2014and he\u2019s a man who gets what he wants. With one burning exception: Rue. The woman he can\u2019t stop thinking about. The woman who's off-limits to him.  Torn between loyalty and an undeniable attraction, Rue and Eli throw caution out the lab and the boardroom windows. Their affair is secret, no-strings-attached, and has a built-in deadline: the day one of their companies will prevail. But the heart is risky business\u2014one that plays for keeps. "
