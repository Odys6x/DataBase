                "Should we make people healthier, smarter, and longer-lived if genetic and medical advances enable us to do so?  The author asks this question in the context of genetic testing and selection, cloning and stem cell research, gene therapies and enhancements. The ethical questions explored include parental responsibility, the use of people as means, the role of hope and fear in risk assessment, and the dignity and meaning of life. Taking as a starting point the arguments presented by Jonathan Glover, John Harris, Ronald M. Green, Ju\u0308rgen Habermas, Michael J. Sandel, and Leon R. Kass, who defend a particular normative view as the only rational or moral answer, the author argues that many coherent rationalities and moralities exist in the field, and that to claim otherwise is mistaken. Features include:  The book introduces only one main ethical consideration with the introduction of a new scientific or medical practice, allowing the reader to gain a thorough picture of the practice and of the nuances of the ethical argument; Each chapter begins with a one-sentence summary of its contents, giving the reader an orientation to the text ahead; Summaries bring all the ethical considerations together, helping the reader see what has been claimed in the book and how these claims have been supported; Separate introductions for genetic practices and philosophical considerations help the reader keep the different dimensions analytically separated. -- Provided by publisher.

                "\"To be successful in the 21st century global marketplace you need many things - determination, well-articulated goals, and a bit of luck. But more than anything else, you need kindness. Kindness becomes the key business asset when you couple a caring attitude toward others with a focus on achieving your goals. Often people see business as a choice between being kind and being successful. This is a fictitious trade-off. Nice people are more successful. Those who wish to succeed in the 21st century business climate which is characterized by intense competition, ever-evolving technologies, and escalating expectations, must make the conscious development of kindness their business imperative. The successes of many of the most accomplished professionals come as a result of developing the Five Powers of Kindness: 1. Reputation: Being trusted and building a strong reputation; 2. Reciprocity: Garnering reciprocal kindnesses from others; 3. Personality: Learning to be someone that others like; 4. Thanks: Being gracious and appreciative of others; and 5. Connecting: Building a strong network of relationships. In Capitalizing on Kindness you will learn simple techniques to harness the Five Powers to your professional advantage.\"--Publisher's description. "

Prado introduces the idea of a \"coincidental culture\" to clarify the variety of values and commitments that influence decisions. He also introduces the idea of a \"proxy premise\" to deal with reasoning issues that are raised by intractably held beliefs.\" \"Primarily intended for medical ethicists, this book will be of interest to anyone concerned with the ability of modern medicine to keep people alive, thereby forcing people to choose between living and dying. In addition, Prado calls upon medical ethicists and practitioners to appreciate the value of a theoretical basis for their work.\"--Jacket. "

C.G. Prado examines how reactions to elective death are influenced by cultural influences and beliefs, particularly those related to life, death, and the possibility of an afterlife. Understanding the role of these cultural influences on the grieving processes of survivors is a crucial step in allowing them to accept both intellectually and emotionally the finality of elective death and to deal with the decision of their loved one\"-- Provided by publisher.

In Goodbye Gordon Gekko, Scaramucci explores opportunities for leading a rich life in a difficult, radically changed economy. Believing that the financial crisis was caused by a nation of Gekko-wannabes tripped up by status anxiety and egocentric tendencies, he argues that you can be happy and financially profitable as long as you stay true to yourself and stick to your values and principles. Scaramucci offers, hope, urging you to pass through the happily-ever-after portal so that you can find your fortune and all that is fortunate. "

Taking as a starting point the arguments presented by Jonathan Glover, John Harris, Ronald M. Green, Ju\u0308rgen Habermas, Michael J. Sandel, and Leon R.

                "This book provides an analysis of the ways in which the BAC has established an ethical framework for biomedical research in Singapore, following the launch of the Biomedical Sciences Initiative by the Singapore Government. The editors and authors have an intimate knowledge of the working of the BAC, and the focus of the book includes the ways in which international forces have influenced the form and substance of bioethics in Singapore. Together, the authors offer a comparative account of the institutionalisation of biomedical research ethics in Singapore, considered in the wider context of international regulatory efforts. The book reviews the work of the BAC by placing it within the broader cultural, social and political discourses that have emerged in relation to the life sciences since the turn of the 21st century. This book is not primarily intended to be a retrospect or an appraisal of the contribution of the BAC, though this is one aspect of it. Rather, the main intention is to make a substantive contribution to the rapidly emerging field of bioethics. Ethical discussions in the book include consideration of stem cell research and cloning, genetics and research with human participants, and focus on likely future developments as well as the past. Many of the contributors of the book have been personally involved in this work, and hence they write with an authoritative first-hand knowledge that scholars in bioethics and public policy may appreciate. As indicated above, the book also explains the way in which ethics and science - international and local - have interacted in a policy setting. Scholars and policy makers may find the Singaporean experience to be a valuable resource, as the approach has been to make the ethical governance of research in Singapore consistent with international best practice while observing the requirements of a properly localised application of universally accepted principles. In addition, at least three chapters (the first three chapters in particular) are accessible to the lay reader interested in the development of bioethics and biomedical sciences, both inside and outside Singapore, from 2000 (the year in which the BAC was established). Both scholars and interested lay readers are therefore likely to find this publication a valuable reference. "

Many companies have tried altering their business processes, and even their organizational structures, but most efforts have not resulted in sustainable competitive advantage. In Transforming the Way We Work, Dr. Edward M. Marshall explains: \"In most instances, the underlying values by which these organizations are led have not changed ... Without fundamental cultural change and the adoption of a new approach to leading and managing, American businesses will continue to experience significant difficulties.\" ",
                "In Transforming the Way We Work, Dr. Marshall presents the \"Collaborative Workplace,\" a powerful and practical answer to this dilemma. This highly successful approach is not a program-of-the-month - it's a total shift in how we approach work. It restores civility and trust to the workplace, gives us a way to empower ourselves, and enables us to create a more profitable business without sacrificing individuality. Transforming the Way We Work demonstrates why collaboration is the vital element for 21st-century survival, and how your organization can create a collaborative environment that works. "

                "\"To be successful in the 21st century global marketplace you need many things - determination, well-articulated goals, and a bit of luck. But more than anything else, you need kindness. Kindness becomes the key business asset when you couple a caring attitude toward others with a focus on achieving your goals. Often people see business as a choice between being kind and being successful. This is a fictitious trade-off. Nice people are more successful. Those who wish to succeed in the 21st century business climate which is characterized by intense competition, ever-evolving technologies, and escalating expectations, must make the conscious development of kindness their business imperative. The successes of many of the most accomplished professionals come as a result of developing the Five Powers of Kindness: 1. Reputation: Being trusted and building a strong reputation; 2. Reciprocity: Garnering reciprocal kindnesses from others; 3. Personality: Learning to be someone that others like; 4. Thanks: Being gracious and appreciative of others; and 5. Connecting: Building a strong network of relationships. In Capitalizing on Kindness you will learn simple techniques to harness the Five Powers to your professional advantage.\"--Publisher's description. "

Makes a significant contribution to the philosophy of teaching and also offers new insights into virtue theory and professional ethics. Offers fresh and detailed readings of major figures in ethics, including Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, and Bernard Williams and the practical philosophies of Hannah Arendt, John Dewey and Hans-Georg Gadamer. Provides illustrations to assist the reader in visualizing major points, and integrates sources such as film, literature, and teaching memoirs to exemplify arguments in an engaging and accessible way. Presents a compelling vision of teaching as a reflective practice showing how this requires us to prepare teachers differently \"-- Provided by publisher. "
