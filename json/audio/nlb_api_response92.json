                "In the bestselling tradition of Charles Duhigg's  The Power of Habit  and Angela Duckworth's  Grit , a renowned social psychologist demonstrates how a subtle turning of habits into rituals can \"clear a little space for everyday magic\" ( The Guardian ) in our lives.  Our lives are filled with repetitive tasks meant to keep us on track\u2014what we come to know as habits. Over time, these routines (like brushing your teeth or putting on your right sock first) tend to be performed automatically. But when we're more mindful about these actions\u2014when we focus on the precise way they are performed\u2014they can instead become rituals. Shifting from a \"habitual\" mindset to a \"ritual\" mindset can convert ordinary acts from black and white to technicolor.   Think about the way you savor a certain beverage, the care you take with a particular outfit that gets worn only on special occasions, the unique way that your family gathers around the table during holidays, or the secret language you enjoy with your significant other. To some, these behaviors may seem quirky, but because rituals matter so deeply to us on a personal level, they give our lives purpose and meaning. Drawing on a decade of original research, Norton shows that rituals play a role in healing communities experiencing a great loss, marking life's major transitions, driving a stadium of sports fans to ecstasy, and helping us rise to challenges and realize opportunities.   Compelling, insightful, and practical,  The Ritual Effect  reminds us of the intention-filled acts that drive human behavior and create sur\u00adprising satisfaction and enjoyment. "

                "How do you maximize your success and impact as a leader while maintaining your stamina and sanity? The answer doesn't lie in simple \"efficiency.\" It's not about making better use of your time and resources. It's about understanding how energy works and how to tap into its power.   Many people live lives of intense, and false, emotional compartmentalization. For example, they strive to be one person in the corner office (invincible warrior) and another person at the dinner table (sensitive spouse), and they struggle to keep those two lives from bleeding into and contradicting each other. But as it turns out, this takes a tremendous amount of energy and is almost always impossible. One person can't be two different people.  So how do you live an integrated life of fulfillment, purpose, and success? How do you create an alignment between head, heart, and the creative power that is in coherence with your true self? The answer is both simple and complex: You need to move from managing your time to mastering your energy.  For more than a decade and a half, Ricardo Sunderland has worked with the leaders of some of the largest and most recognizable companies in the world. He has learned firsthand that for today's leaders\u2014at all levels in their organizations\u2014mental and physical energy are no longer all you need for success. Today's leaders must bring emotional and spiritual energy to their roles and create a space in which both they and their team members feel safe to challenge each other, grow together, and thrive.  Given this major leadership challenge, leaders must gain the energy advantage.  You will learn:  What gives you energy.  How to identify the energy blockers that are holding you back.  That every situation presents a choice for you to unlock the transformational source of energy within you.  The path to gaining the energy advantage on seven distinct levels. "

A Life Impossible  will change the way people cope, think, and live.\" \u2013Mike Lupica, co-author with James Patterson of  12 Months to Live    In 2011, three years after leaving the NFL, Steve Gleason was diagnosed with ALS,\u00a0a terminal disease that takes away the ability to move, talk, and breathe. Doctors gave him three years to live. He was\u00a0thirty-three years old. As Steve says, he is now ten years past his expiration date. His memoir is the chronicle of a remarkable life, one filled with optimism and joy, despite the trauma and pain and despair he has experienced. Writing using eye-tracking technology, Gleason covers his pre-ALS life through the highs and lows of his NFL career with the New Orleans Saints, where he made one of the most memorable plays in Saints history, leading to a victory in the first post-Katrina home game,\u00a0uplifting the city, making him a hero, and reflected in a nine-foot bronze statue outside the Superdome. Then came his heartbreaking diagnosis. Gleason lost all muscle function,\u00a0he now uses Stephen Hawking-like technology to communicate, and breathes with the help of a ventilator. This book captures Gleason and his wife Michel\u2019s unmatched resilience as they reinvent their lives, refuse to succumb to despair, and face his disease realistically and existentially. This unsparing portrait argues that a person's true strength does not reside solely in one\u2019s body but also in the ability to face\u00a0unfathomable adversity\u00a0and still be able to love and treasure life.

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, a disturbing social media trend emerged: a large number of yoga instructors and alt-health influencers were posting stories about a secretive global cabal bent on controlling the world's population with a genocidal vaccine. Instagram feeds that had been serving up green smoothie recipes and Mary Oliver poems became firehoses of Fox News links, memes from 4chan, and prophecies of global transformation.  Since May 2020, Derek Beres, Matthew Remski and Julian Walker have used their  Conspirituality  podcast to expose countless facets of the intersection of alt-health practitioners with far-right conspiracy trolls. Now this expansive and revelatory book unpacks the follies, frauds, cons and cults that dominate the New Age and wellness spheres and betray the trust of people who seek genuine relief in this uncertain age.  With analytical rigor and irreverent humor,  Conspirituality  offers an antidote to our times, helping readers recognize wellness grifts, engage with loved ones who've fallen under the influence, and counter lies and distortions with insight and empathy.

From the warm-up of first days with a newborn to the wobbly-but-standing postures of confident new motherhood,  Breathing Space for New Mothers  encourages women to notice and nurture their feelings and foster self-compassion to approach motherhood with curiosity instead of fear, improvisation instead of rigidity, and humor instead of worry. The authors offer mothers a singular message: your well-being matters as much as your baby\u2019s. Each chapter ends with a one-minute mindful yoga practice, which can be done in a sequence to create a relaxing and balancing support for the incredibly demanding first nine months with a baby. "

Looking at each part of the Great Pyramid, from the internal chambers to its massive stone blocks to the pyramidion on top, Dunn reveals how the pyramids in Egypt served to stimulate the release and collection of electrons in the Earth's crust by harmonizing seismic energy while also attenuating the accumulating stresses. Drawing on exhaustive ongoing research by NASA scientists into the phenomenon known as \"earthquake lights,\" Dunn shows how the pyramid builders were inspired by this phenomenon and learned to stress igneous rocks in order to harvest the resulting electron flow. He looks in depth at recent research that supports the pyramid energy theory, including new explorations of the shafts of the Queen's Chamber and analysis of the scorch marks on the ceiling of the Grand Gallery, which supports the King's Chamber explosion hypothesis. He examines the stunning significance of the large void above the Grand Gallery discovered in 2017. Dunn also analyses the results of extensive acoustic testing and measurements at ancient sacred sites and shows how the pyramids were tuned to the Earth's frequency.  While the pyramids' sophisticated energy-harvesting abilities are now in disarray and disuse, some remnants of their technologies are still there, waiting to be rediscovered and provide our civilization with an abundance of nonpolluting power.

                "In celebration of its 10th anniversary, a revised and updated edition of the award-winning #1 New York Times bestseller that changed the way we look at meditation, expanded with new material by Dan Harris.   After having a nationally televised panic attack on Good Morning America, Dan Harris knew he had to make some changes. A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head.  We all have an inner narrator. It's what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we're not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us assume we're stuck with this voice\u2014that there's nothing we can do to rein it in\u2014but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that.  10% Happier is now considered a classic text on the power of meditation, an introduction to the practice that can convert even the most hardened skeptic. With over a million copies sold, 10% Happier is the go-to guide, and with meditation now a widely accepted and encouraged practice, Dan Harris is a pivotal and approachable figure in the field who has built a thriving platform based on the ideas he first presented in this book.  In this 10th Anniversary Edition, Harris offers a new preface reflecting on how much has changed\u2014for him and for the public perceptions of meditation, plus a revised and expanded appendix, filled with guided meditations and practical advice for people looking to boot up a habit.

But as a young doctor early in her career, she was overwhelmed. Her team was working at full capacity, yet Dr. Blackmon struggled to meet the needs of her many patients. Then one day at clinic she noticed patients trading stories in the waiting room, sharing not just valuable advice, but empathy and encouragement. That was the genesis of the support group, a safe place where people dealing with cancer and its aftermath could talk openly about what they were going through. It was a lightbulb experience for Dr. Blackmon. Once she saw the difference a committed ally could make in a patient's long-term survivorship, Dr. Blackmon sought to extend the principles of support to her colleagues. Physicians, surgeons, and other healthcare workers endure long hours under constant stress and can succumb burnout due to the tidal wave of administrative work, patient complications, and constant pressure from administration to meet impossible demands. One doctor commits suicide every day in the United States, the highest suicide rate of any profession. Understanding and allyship can make a big difference in their lives too. An indispensable resource written by an experienced professional, The Support Group takes a candid look at the role of support in our healthcare practices and offers a workable model for patients, caregivers, and providers alike.

After taking his vows to become a B\u00f6n monk and completing a pilgrimage around 22,000-foot Mount Kailash, the holiest mountain in Tibet, Tenzin Namdak envisions a life of quiet contemplation at Menri, B\u00f6n's mother monastery. Instead, he finds himself fleeing for his life across the highest and most difficult terrain on the planet.  After Tenzin's escape party is ambushed and he is severely wounded, Tenzin is taken to a concentration camp, where he overcomes his nearly fatal wound before making an arduous escape from Tibet over the daunting Himalayas.  The other two monks, lifelong friends Samten Karmay and Sangye Tenzin, witness Tibet's capital explode in a violent insurrection against Chinese rule. Escaping to Nepal, they worry about the survival of the B\u00f6n religion and begin collecting scattered works of B\u00f6n scripture. A chance meeting with British scholar David Snellgrove brings the three monks together and dramatically changes their lives. Tenzin founds a B\u00f6n settlement in exile in India, Sangye is chosen as the thirty-third Menri Trizen, B\u00f6n's highest office, and together the three monks help rebuild the nearly extinct B\u00f6n religion. Aside from the escape of the Dalai Lama, no other escape from Tibet has been so consequential for so many. "

Conservationist and marine biologist Maddalena Bearzi made her career studying the wild creatures of the deep, but when COVID-19 made landfall on the California coast this seafaring scientist found herself shuttered up ashore, her wide blue world constricted by pandemic lockdown. Never good at sitting idle, she despaired at the confines of her Los Angeles flat-until she began to find wonder in the wilderness of her own backyard. Stranded charts Bearzi's discovery of both rapture and resilience in the unsung wildlife of urban LA. With a green thumb and a canine sidekick, she finds as much to marvel at in her garden's singing blackbirds, night-blooming cacti, and industrious wasps as in the whales, dolphins, and sea lions at the center of her maritime adventures. Discovering in the quotidian an antidote to the grief occasioned by captivity and climate chaos, Bearzi reveals how each of us can take heart, find courage, and discover inspiration in the thrumming systems of life that surround us. With a scientist's precision and a poet's instinct, she invites us to look at, listen to, and revel in the everyday grandeur of the natural world-and to embrace, with urgency, our responsibility to sustain it.

                "Strategic Jaywalking \u00a0is at once a playful, yet sober assessment of how we might live and lead better by judiciously keeping our devices and policies on a leash and exercising a little more conscious thought and decision-making responsibility in our work and lives. It relies on something that nearly all of us were taught at a young age - how to safely cross a street, and yet, by idiot-proofing the experience via rules and technology (think painted crosswalks, beeping timers, and flashing red hands,) we have in many respects made the process both slower and more dangerous. In too many ways, and for too long, we have done the same by allowing leadership to morph into 'supervising' because, well, it's simpler and not as messy. Jay is of the mind that you 'supervise' young children, with a goal of willful compliance. Adults, on the other hand, engage much better via the influence of competent and capable leadership that lets them think for themselves. "

                "A yoga and meditation instructor offers a new take on mindfulness through the practice of introversion\u2014a way to find your authentic self to balance life in our hectic, extroverted world.   Lead Instructor of Yoga and Meditation for Peloton Ross Rayburn offers a new and accessible take on mindfulness and the art of meditation through the practice of introversion, which is a method of self-exploration for finding authenticity, joy, and calm in our hectic, extroverted world.\u200b    Building off his popular Peloton meditation and yoga classes and his years of teaching and spiritual study, Ross Rayburn offers a new way to look at meditation. Rather than a purely esoteric practice, meditation is, Ross argues, simply \"turning in,\" which anyone can learn how to do through the practice of introversion. Because we spend most of our time \"turned outward\" in order to function in society, introversion offers both a respite and a source of insight.  The practice of introversion leads to a happier, calmer life and a truer sense of yourself and your path\u2014something many crave in our chaotic and often polarized world.     With the easy and enjoyable techniques in this book, and a surprisingly simple and straightforward way of thinking and seeing, you can begin introverting with more intention and with more structure and regularity, for even greater benefits. You'll learn how to handle life's difficulties with less anxiety and greater perspective, and you'll have the tools to remember who you really are, especially during those times it's easiest to forget.    Through these practical exercises, guided visualizations, opportunities for contemplation, breathing techniques, and more, you will discover that everything you need to be is already who you are. It's inside you. All you have to do is turn inward to find it. "

Common has achieved success in many facets of his life and career, from music to acting to writing. But for a long time, he didn't feel that he had found fulfillment in his body and spirit.  And Then We Rise is about Common's journey to wellness as a vital element of his success. A testimony to the benefits of self-care, this book is composed of four different sections, each with its own important lessons: \"The Food\" focuses on nutrition. \"The Body\" focuses on fitness. \"The Mind\" focuses on mental health. And \"The Soul\" focuses on perhaps the most profound thing of all\u2014spiritual well-being.   Common's personal stories act as the backbone of his book, but he also wants to give his readers the gift of professional expertise. Here, he acts as the liaison to his own nutritionist and chef, his own physical trainer, and his own therapist, as well as to those who act as his spiritual influences.  Wise, accessible, and powerful, And Then We Rise offers a comprehensive, holistic approach to wellness that will allow readers to transform their thinking, their actions, and, ultimately, their lives.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

In an unprecedented collaboration between three of today\u2019s most powerful minds, Deepak Chopra, M.D., teams up with physicist Jack Tuszynski, Ph.D., and endocrinologist Brian Fertig, M.D., to bring readers a visionary work that delves into the innovative world of quantum science and shows how unlocking its secrets can revolutionize how we live and age\u2014and, ultimately, how we can eradicate disease. The key is the quantum body.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Unlike our physical body, which is subject to aging, injury, and decay, the quantum body exists on a sub-atomic level and is the infinite, invisible source of everyday reality that affects your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and biological responses. Without your quantum body, there is no physical body. And this lack of awareness of the most crucial part of ourselves negatively impacts our lives every day.\u00a0 Through a powerful combination of prescriptive exercises and innovative research into the quantum world, the authors   unveil seven breakthroughs that will revolutionize the future of everyone\u2019s well-being. Central to this revolution is a groundbreaking understanding of metabolism\u2014the way our cells process energy\u2014that promises to challenge our understanding of modern medicine as we know it. Though all too familiar in the physical world, Alzheimer\u2019s, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and heart disease  do not exist  at\u00a0the fundamental level of quantum reality. By harnessing the power of the quantum body, we can significantly improve our physical and mental well-being, including supporting healthy cell, tissue, and organ function, boosting immunity, promoting mental resilience, and expanding our understanding of what it means to live a happy and purposeful life. In this groundbreaking book, Chopra, Tuszynski, and Fertig show you the way by unveiling the \u201creal\u201d reality of your body and mind as never before and providing a vision for a tomorrow that is already here.

Hugely popular in Korea, Haemin Sunim is a Zen meditation teacher whose teachings transcend religions and borders and resonate with people of all ages. With insight and compassion drawn from a life full of change, the 'mega-monk' succeeds at encouraging all of us to notice that when you slow down, the world slows down with you. "

'Heartfelt, passionate, infuriating and often devastating, this book will inspire you to fight for your right to tread your own path' CAROLINE CRIADO PEREZ, author of Invisible Women  When Rachel loses five family members in five months, grief magnifies other absences. Running across moors and mountains used to help her feel at home in her body and the world, but now she becomes painfully aware of her inability to run without being cat-called or followed by strange men, or to walk alone at night without fear. Her eyes are opened to injustices facing women in sport, from men who push her off paths during races, to male bias in competition regulations, kit and media coverage. The outdoors becomes a place of danger, sharpening her sense of the grief women experience - every day, everywhere - for lack of freedom. Rachel goes in search of a new family: the foremothers who blazed a trail at the dawn of outdoor sport. She discovers Lizzie Le Blond, a courageous Anglo-Irishwoman who scaled the Alps in woollen skirts, photographed fearless women climbing, skating and tobogganing at breakneck speeds, and founded the Ladies' Alpine Club, defying men who wanted the mountains to themselves. Yet after such groundbreaking progress in the late 1800s, a backlash drove women out of sports and public space. Are we now living through a similar reversal in women's rights or an era of unprecedented liberty? Telling Lizzie's story alongside her own, Rachel runs her way from bereavement to belonging, in a world that feels hostile to women. On the way she's inspired by the tenacious women, past and present, who insist that breaking boundaries outdoors is, and always has been, in her nature. \u00a92023 Rachel Hewitt (P)2023 Penguin Audio.

                "The memoir of a Catholic nun\u2019s spiritual journey that explores the deep connections between faith and the natural world   Growing up in the Midwest, Judy Grathwohl never felt she belonged. \u201cI belong out west,\u201d she remembers telling her father. After joining the Sisters of St. Francis in the early 1960s and becoming Sister Marya, she came to realize that she craved a life beyond the traditional path of a Catholic nun. \u201cSomething other than dedicating my life to God was summoning me, some other life purpose,\u201d she writes.  It took several years and several detours, but when Sister Marya eventually was assigned by her order to the Northwest, she felt an immediate connection to the place and to its Native people, the Crow and Northern Cheyenne. Little by little, she was invited to become part of their communities, to share their customs and rituals, and eventually was adopted into one of their families. She came to understand that the blending of Catholic teachings and Native traditions helped build within her a deeper respect for the Earth\u2014this wheel of rocks\u2014that she could not have built on her own.\u00a0  In this intimate, revelatory memoir, Sister Marya recounts her own spiritual journey, her settling in Montana, how she\u2014a Catholic nun from Ohio\u2014came to be embraced by the Crow and Northern Cheyenne, and how their traditions prompted in her an expanding devotion to the land, its resources, and its connections to faith and God.  Honest and eye-opening, funny and heartfelt,  This Wheel of Rocks  shows how living a spiritual life committed to preserving nature and community can be both fulfilling and productive.  *\u00a0This audiobook edition includes a downloadable PDF containing a list of additional gospel references mentioned in the book.

In this audiobook, Anita shares how after fighting cancer for almost four years, her body began shutting down. As her organs failed, she entered into an extraordinary near-death experience where she would realize her inherent worth and the actual cause of her disease. Upon regaining consciousness, Anita found that her condition had improved so rapidly that she was able to be released from the hospital within weeks . . . without a trace of cancer in her body! After years of struggling to forge her own path while trying to meet everyone else's expectations, she had the realization-as a result of her epiphany on the other side-that she had the power to heal herself . . . and that there are miracles in the Universe that she had never even imagined. In Dying to Be Me, Anita shares all she has learned about illness, healing, fear, \"being love,\" and the true magnificence of each and every human being!. "

                "Soulfull  is a gentle nudge to reorient our intentions and want more for our one precious life: a collection of spiritual reflections, recipes, activities, and prayers that come together as an encyclopedia of hope and spiritual direction.   \u201c Soulfull  rebuilt and bolstered some corners of my soul that had been worn away. What a gift!\u201d\u2014Shauna Niequist,  New York Times  bestselling author of  I Guess I Haven\u2019t Learned That Yet    Are we truly living the life we want to live? Sometimes, but not nearly enough. Our souls crave authentic experiences, but seeking them is a challenge in our overcommitted world where often we are more focused on \u201cmaking it through\u201d than on \u201cmaking it sacred.\u201d We need regular soul wake-up calls and holy daily rhythms to live a life that feels good from the inside out, shines with meaning, and radiates joy. In this refreshingly original invitation to soulful living, Farrell Mason speaks to the universal human experience: navigating relationships, coping with change, rebounding from a setback or loss, finding peace, and prioritizing food, fellowship, faith, and regular joy.  Soulfull  offers balanced and creative ways to pull a little bit of heaven down to our patches of earth. Whether you\u2019re taking a walk in nature, reading a meditation on hope, finding comfort in a prayer, creating a sumptuous recipe for family and friends, or planting an herb garden,  Soulfull  is an adventure\u2014a mothering toward new growth, an exploration of life-giving experiences, and a joyous resource to nourish your soul and welcome a life filled with more wonder, delight, and meaning.

Or is it something more primal, a fear that these creatures represent the very worst of humanity's dark nature given physical form? Whatever the reason, tales of monsters have been with us since the dawn of time and show no sign of abating. In The Big Book of Monsters Vol I, Josh Nanocchio, acclaimed host of the popular YouTube channel What Lurks Beneath, has collected some of the most chilling, hair-raising, and downright unbelievable accounts of monster sightings from around the world.

So, if you're brave enough, open and discover for yourself if monsters are real. "

When we are kids, we always smile, we laugh for no reason out of all the little aspects of our lives, we feel free and we transform everything into a game. Even when we are serious, our hearts are clean, and laughter and smiles are a second away. But as we grow up and mature, life installs in with its usual problems, difficult situations, and sometimes unwanted circumstances, and smiling becomes a hard thing to do. This book is created for those of us that forgot how it feels to smile, those who need to be reminded that nothing heals more our hearts and minds than a simple and sincere smile.I will guide you throughout the book on a journey where we can remember together the importance of the smile, and where we will see which practices we can do to bring back our smiles and rejoice in its tremendous power to make us whole, again.

It\u2019s the guide we didn\u2019t know we so desperately needed.\u201d\u2014Dr. Will Cole, functional medicine expert, and  New York Times  bestselling author of  Intuitive Fasting  and  Gut Feelings   In a culture that constantly tells us to do more of everything but simultaneously pressures us to do nothing,  Permission to Rest  is a passionate cry for a more regulated, resourced, and rested life. Wellness expert Ashley Neese combines personal essays, contemplative questions, scientific research, and somatic practices to help us disrupt the state of urgency, reflect inward, and relax deeply. Neese examines common beliefs around rest and offers support and guidance to challenge the shame, guilt, and discomfort that often arise when we attempt to slow down. Neese presents a series of body-focused rest practices for those who are running on empty, such as Cultivating a Rest/Work Rhythm, Nature Bathing, and Social Media Sabbatical. She addresses common roadblocks when beginning a rest practice, the incredible health benefits of prioritizing rest, and a number of holistic resources for developing a sustainable relationship to rest. The practices work for those short on time, but their benefits build the more you practice every day.\u00a0  Permission to Rest  is both a timely manifesto and compassionate call to action. In her signature warm, grounding, and authoritative style, Neese invites each of us to pause, look inward, learn to feel our own rhythms, and value rest as a deeply healing, empowering, and spiritual practice. This book is a reminder that we have the power to transform our lives from the inside out. "

Near the end of life, many people\u2014including those who have suffered brain injuries or strokes, or have been silenced by mental illness or deep dementia\u2014experience what seems a miraculous return. They regain their clarity and energy, are able to talk with families and caregivers, recall their lives and often appear to be aware of their nearing death. In this remarkable audiobook, cognitive scientist and Director of the Viktor Frankl Institute Dr. Alexander Batthy\u00e1ny offers the first major account of terminal lucidity, utilizing hundreds of case studies and his research in the related field of near-death studies to explore the mind, the body, the nature of consciousness, and what the living can learn from those who are crossing the border from life to death. Astonishing, authoritative, and deeply moving, Threshold opens a doorway into one of life's\u2014and death's\u2014most provocative mysteries.

                "In the mid-1960s, Betty and Barney Hill became famous as the first Americans to claim that aliens had taken them aboard a spacecraft against their will. Their story-involving a lonely highway late at night, lost memories, and medical examinations by small gray creatures with large eyes-has become the template for nearly every encounter with aliens in American popular culture since. Historian Matthew Bowman examines the Hills' story not only as a foundational piece of UFO folklore but also as a microcosm of 1960s America. The Hills, an interracial couple who lived in New Hampshire, were civil rights activists, supporters of liberal politics, and Unitarians. But when their story of abduction was repeatedly ignored or discounted by authorities, they lost faith in the scientific establishment, the American government, and the success of the civil rights movement. Bowman tells the fascinating story of the Hills as an account of the shifting winds in American politics and culture in the second half of the twentieth century. He exposes the promise and fallout of the idealistic reforms of the 1960s and how the myth of political consensus has given way to the cynicism and conspiratorialism and the paranoia and illusion of American life today.

At the core of Ho'oponopono are four magical sentences: I am sorry, Please forgive me, I love you, Thank you. A deceptively simple yet enormously effective practice, Ho'oponopono is centered on the concept that we are all deeply connected and that small acts of forgiveness and reconciliation can ripple outward to help and heal others. Newly revised and expanded, this bestselling guide offers practical exercises and Ho'oponopono contemplations to help you immediately create positive changes in your everyday life. The author explains how  Ho'oponopono  means \"restoring the divine order.\" Whether it is your relationship with your partner, your children or parents, your health, Mother Earth, your business, job, or financial situation, Ho'oponopono can help you set straight anything veering off course through understanding and self-forgiveness. The author explores the process of focusing on difficult conflicts within personal relationships, whether in the present or the past, and shows how, by addressing these issues, owning one's feelings, and accepting unconditional love, unhealthy situations transform into positive outcomes and growth. He also looks at how to use Ho'oponopono on a collective level to bring peace to the world. Presenting a step-by-step introduction to the ancient ritual of Ho'oponopono, this book shows how practical forgiveness work can help bring healing to self, family, and community as well as support all of humanity to become more connected and loving again.

                "\u2022 Discover the six keys to empowerment and take ownership of your life \u2022 Activate the healing power of your subconscious mind to accelerate change and growth and eliminate the root causes of chronic anxiety, depression, and other limiting mental and emotional challenges \u2022 Learn effective brain-rewiring methods and practical tools based on neuro-linguistic programming and clinical hypnotherapy When you're struggling with anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, just keeping your emotions in check seems like a full-time job. Yet, what may hold you back in life even more are your survival patterns. Have you ever wondered why you make yourself invisible, procrastinate, or please others to get their approval? Our subconscious employs survival patterns like these to protect us from rejection, failure, and hurt. However, living in subconscious \"survival mode\" has significant downsides: when we live \"just to survive,\" we become disconnected from our true selves and our innate ability to live an empowered life of purpose, fulfillment, and self-reliant confidence.  In this step-by-step guide, Friedemann Schaub, M.D., Ph.D., explores how to break free from the six most common survival patterns\u2014the victim, invisibility, the procrastinator, the chameleon, the helper, and the lover\u2014by engaging the part of the mind that created them in the first place: the subconscious. Providing research-backed insights and brain- rewiring methods based on his 20 years' experience, Dr. Friedemann details how, through activating the healing power of the subconscious, you can throw off the shackles of these self-sabotaging patterns and \"flip\" them into the six keys to self-empowerment, allowing you to take self-reliant ownership of your life. Revealing how to work with the subconscious mind and become the leader of your life, the author details how to free yourself from living in survival mode, learn to love and accept yourself, and make authenticity and confidence your everyday way of being.

Since Copernicus, humanity has increasingly seen itself as adrift, an insignificant speck within a large, cold universe. Brazilian physicist, astronomer, and winner of the 2019 Templeton Prize Marcelo Gleiser argues that it is because we have lost the spark of the Enlightenment that has guided human development over the past several centuries. While some scientific efforts have been made to overcome this increasingly bleak perspective\u2014the ongoing search for life on other planets, the recent idea of the multiverse\u2014they have not been enough to overcome the core problem: we've lost our moral mission and compassionate focus in our scientific endeavors.  Gleiser argues that we're using the wrong paradigm to relate to the universe and our position in it. In this deeply researched and beautifully rendered book, he calls for us to embrace a new life-centric perspective, one which recognizes just how rare and precious life is and why it should be our mission to preserve and nurture it. The Dawn of a Mindful Universe addresses the current environmental and scientific impasses and how the scientific community can find solutions to them.  Gleiser's paradigm rethinks the ideals of the Enlightenment, and proposes a new direction for humanity, one driven by human reason and curiosity whose purpose is to save civilization itself. Within this model, we can once again see ourselves as the center of the universe\u2014the place where life becomes conscious\u2014and regain a clear moral compass which can be used to guide both science and the politics around it.

Dr. Bradley Nelson, a globally renowned expert in bioenergetic medicine, has spent decades teaching his powerful self-healing method and training practitioners around the globe, but this is the first time his system of healing will be available to the general public in the form of  The Body Code.   The Body Code  is based on the simple premise that the body is self-healing and knows what it needs in order to thrive and flourish. The Body Code method allows readers to tap into this inner knowing, and find imbalances in 6 key areas - Energies, Circuits and Systems, Toxicity, Nutrition and Lifestyle, Misalignments, and Pathogens - that are the root causes of our physical, mental and emotional issues. By identifying and releasing these imbalances, readers become empowered to activate their body's innate healing power. Filled with powerful first-hand accounts of healing, hundreds of colour illustrations, and concrete, actionable steps,  The Body Code  is a road map to healing based in deep study of the human body, time-proven ancient practices, and the unlimited power of the subconscious mind. \u00a92023 Bradley Nelson (P)2023 Penguin Audio.

                "A gripping chronicle of psychological manipulation and abuse at a \"therapeutic\" boarding school for troubled teens, and how one young woman fought to heal in the aftermath.  At fifteen, Elizabeth Gilpin was an honor student, a state-ranked swimmer and a rising soccer star, but behind closed doors her undiagnosed depression was wreaking havoc on her life. Growing angrier by the day, she began skipping practices and drinking to excess. At a loss, her parents turned to an educational consultant who suggested Elizabeth be enrolled in a behavioral modification program. That recommendation would change her life forever. The nightmare began when she was abducted from her bed in the middle of the night by hired professionals and dropped off deep in the woods of Appalachia. Living with no real shelter was only the beginning of her ordeal: she was strip-searched, force-fed, her name was changed to a number and every moment was a test of physical survival.  After three brutal months, Elizabeth was transferred to a boarding school in Southern Virginia that in reality functioned more like a prison. Its curriculum revolved around a perverse form of group therapy where students were psychologically abused and humiliated. Finally, at seventeen, Elizabeth convinced them she was rehabilitated enough to \"graduate\" and was released. In this eye-opening and unflinching book, Elizabeth recalls the horrors she endured, the friends she lost to suicide and addiction, and\u2014years later\u2014how she was finally able to pick up the pieces of her life and reclaim her identity.

Remembered in Celtic legends as Tu-lay, and referred to by geologists as Doggerland or Fairland, this civilization began at least as early as 4000 BCE but was ultimately destroyed by rising sea levels, huge tsunamis, and a terrible viral epidemic released from melting permafrost during a cataclysmic period of global warming.  Exploring the latest archaeological findings and recent scientific analysis of Doggerland's underwater remains, Graham Phillips shows that this ancient culture had sophisticated technology and advanced medical knowledge. He looks at evidence detected with remote sensing and seismic profiling of many artificial structures, complex settlements, gigantic earthworks, epic monoliths, and huge stone circles dated to more than 5,500 years ago preserved beneath the ground and on the ocean floor. He also looks at the small part of the Fairland landmass that still exists: Fair Isle, a tiny island some 45 miles north of the Orkney Islands of Scotland. Phillips shows how, when Fairland sank beneath the waves around 3100 BCE, its last survivors traveled by boat to settle in the British Isles, where they established the megalithic culture that built Stonehenge.  Revealing the vast archaeological evidence in support of the existence of Doggerland, as well as its threads of influence in early cultures around the world, Phillips also shows how the fate of this sophisticated ancient culture is a warning from history: the cataclysmic events that happened to the first civilizations could happen again as the world heats up.

Lisa Weinert's work is based on the premise that we hold our stories in our bodies. The extent that we learn how to release them affects how we perceive and approach our lives - but what if we don't have the tools to understand our narrative outside of what's been told to us?\u202f What if we don't have access to our own story due to trauma? What if we are unable to share our truth with the world? In Narrative Healing, she empowers readers to identify, understand and tap into the healing power of their stories.    Following her own personal healing journey, Lisa draws upon twenty years of experience to offer a new paradigm for personal growth, self-care and community action through an embodied writing practice. Combining somatic practices, creative prompts, and mindfulness exercises, Lisa guides you through the six steps of healing through storytelling: awaken, listen, express, inspire, connect, and grow. Incorporating creativity as a core part of the process, Narrative Healing provides writers and non-writers a comforting yet equally empowering process to find a path to themselves and find deep connection with the world around them.    The premise here is simple: our stories have a healing purpose and are meant to be shared.\u202f As we are able to better know our own stories, we are better able to take in the humanity of those around us.

Nefertiti. Hatshepsut. All of them are ancient Egyptian female rulers who rose above their predominantly patriarchal societies to become controllers of a great empire. Missing from this list, however, is Sobekneferu, ancient Egypt's first female ruler. Why was the reign of this powerful woman all but forgotten?  Piecing together the lost history of the first female pharaoh, Andrew Collins presents the first comprehensive biography of Sobekneferu. Using every text and monument that concerns Sobekneferu and her time in power, he examines her achievements as ruler, the political and religious issues of her age, the temples and ruins associated with her, and her continuing impact on ancient Egypt after her reign. He explores her relationship with her brother Amenemhat IV, her sister Neferuptah, and their father Amenemhat III, regarded as one of the most beloved pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom. He examines Sobekneferu's untimely end, the fate of her body, and the cult that developed in her name.  Discussing Sobekneferu's magical beliefs and practices, Collins shows how they centered on the crocodile god Sobek, the hippopotamus goddess Neith, and Sekhmet, the goddess presiding over divine power. He reveals also how Sobekneferu's suspected pyramid was positioned to align with the setting of Eltanin, the brightest star in the constellation of Draco, seen in ancient Egypt as the celestial form of Sobek. Examining the modern-day resurrection of Sobekneferu among the occultists and mystics of Victorian London, Collins shows how she is the true inspiration behind every ancient Egyptian female queen who comes back to life after her tomb is found\u2014as featured first in Bram Stoker's shocking 1903 novel The Jewel of Seven Stars and later in several modern blockbuster movies.  Revealing how Sobekneferu has left a lasting impact on culture and occulture through the ages despite being nearly erased from history, Collins shows how her continuing legacy is perhaps, ultimately, her true resurrection.

A guide to help us clearly see that we are not alone, and that sharing your story is powerful and healing.   When actress and activist Brittany Snow was a teenager, she read an article about another woman's hardship that made her feel seen and less alone. She carried that story in her back pocket for a long time. This experience was a gift that Brittany then paid forward when she revealed her own experience in a published article. Brittany's story resonated with a young reader, who kept that story in her back pocket, where it was when the two crossed paths serendipitously.  In   September Letters, Brittany Snow and close friend and SL cofounder Jaspre Guest show us how sharing our stories reveals our greater connection. This book features a collection of original letters and notes from Hannah Bronfman, Lily Cornell Silver, Kid Cudi, Maria Menounos, and more, alongside interviews with mental health experts like David Kessler, Gretchen Rubin, Mark Epstein, Jay Shetty, and Wendy Suzuki.  Equal parts guide and resource, September Letters is for anyone seeking to feel more connected with themselves and others.      Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Although UFOs \"officially\" did not exist for decades according to the government, reports of sightings continue to be made, and the latest releases from the government and related hearings have surprised the world. While the scientific community has put UFOs out to pasture, the evidence used to dismiss them is rare and unscientific. Dr. Hynek, a scientist himself, and the only government-paid ufologist in history, looks at the decisions made by officialdom in the early days of ufology and how these decisions have held us back-to the point that we are still naively talking about UFOs as we were in the 1950s. Has seventy years of research made no difference at all in our understanding? Dr. Hynek proves that there is a conspiracy afoot to hide the facts and that there are many cases that still need to be explained by mainstream science-not dismissed with facile jokes and stupid logic. Citing specific cases, Hynek challenges those in the ivory tower by raising questions that have still not been answered and refuting mainstream arguments that have yet to be proven. "

Will to Wild  is an instruction manual to adventure. Your guide: enthusiastic outdoorswoman Shelby Stanger. Shelby has been teaching folks how to leap into the unknown since she taught her first surf class over twenty years ago. Over the years, she watched many of her students quit their jobs, end dysfunctional relationships, and move across the country for a healthier work-life-balance\u2014all after spending a bit of time in nature. Shelby marveled at the phenomenon. Being outside was changing the lives of her students, her peers, and herself. Shelby was so intrigued, she began to tell their stories, first as a writer and journalist, then as a podcast host for  Wild Ideas Worth Living , REI Co-op Studio's flagship podcast.    With her first book,  Will to Wild , Shelby shares all she's witnessed and learned in her years covering adventurers. It's the book she wishes she'd had when she'd first felt the urge to leap from familiar to wild terrain. The one that takes you step-by-step from the first inkling of inspiration for your own wild idea through fear and self-doubt and on to the finish line.    In these pages, you will find stories with practical tips and tactics from world-famous rock climbers and ultra-runners, to longtime thru-hikers, surfers, desk jockeys who've figured out how to get off the clock, and even a suburban mom who started teaching women to scale frozen waterfalls in her mid-fifties. Along with Shelby's stories, they will show you how to get unstuck, how to pay attention to \"trail signs\" that point you toward your adventure, how to face your fears, and what to do when everything goes haywire (which will likely happen, never fear!). With Shelby's characteristic strength and vulnerability,  Will to Wild  encourages you to break out of your comfort zones, get out into nature, and bring their own wild ideas to life. Whether you're already an adventure junkie or someone who's never set up a tent, there's something inside these pages for you. "

                "A guide to developing the art of finding serenity, not through meditation, but through understanding the sources of our anxiety and frustrations. Few life skills are as neglected, yet as important, as the ability to remain calm. Our very worst decisions and interactions are almost invariably the result of a loss of calm \u2013 and a descent into anxiety and agitation. Surprisingly, but very fortunately, our power to remain calm can be rehearsed and improved. We don't have to stay where we are now: our responses to everyday challenges can dramatically alter. We can educate ourselves in the art of keeping calm not through slow breathing or special teas but through thinking. This is a book that patiently unpacks the causes of our greatest stresses and gives us a succession of highly persuasive, beautiful and sometimes dryly comic arguments with which to defend ourselves against panic and fury.

Ulander chronicles with powerful clarity the bewildering predicament he confronted and the fellowship and guidance that transformed him during the year he served as an American GI in the jungles of Vietnam. Conveying with unadorned precision the harrowing experiences that shatter his core beliefs, Ulander also captures the camaraderie and humor of his platoon, the hostility between \u201clifers\u201d and draftees, the physical hardships of reconnaissance missions, and the unrelenting apprehension underlying everyday life. Ultimately, he describes the surrendering of social norms and accepted identities that allows him to glimpse a previously unimagined realm of heightened awareness.  \u00a0  Written after a lifetime of reflection on the nature of war and the effect of violence and domination on the minds and spirits of those forced to practice it,\u00a0 Walking Point \u00a0offers a powerful narrative for readers with an interest in the effects of war and violence, American involvement in Vietnam, PTSD, and how trauma can be a catalyst for spiritual transformation. Giving voice to profound insights gained through extreme adversity, Ulander movingly captures the depth of trust and commitment among a group of unwitting warriors who struggle to stay alive and sane in unchartered territory.

                "A lifelong Emerson lover, teacher, and spiritual seeker reveals how American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson's twelve essential teachings hold the answer to living an authentic and fulfilling life, one that is in harmony with our souls.   Ralph Waldo Emerson was a spiritual revolutionary whose profound vision of human potential came to define the American character. Known as America's original Stoic, he offered a radical message of optimism, authenticity, and self-realization that is more necessary today than ever.  In this timely, remarkable book, noted memoirist and teacher Mark Matousek reveals the depths of Emerson's extraordinary wisdom, demonstrating how his timeless philosophy can help us navigate the challenges of contemporary life. Using personal stories, psychological research, and life lessons from Emerson and his contemporaries\u2014including Thoreau and Whitman\u2014 he offers practical lessons in the art of living. In the following pages, you will discover:  Why Emerson should be considered America's original stoic  How to dispel the illusion of our own powerlessness and turn toward boundless human potential  Practical tools for cultivating happiness in a fragile, unpredictable, dangerous world  The gifts of self-reliance and spiritual renewal necessary for thriving  A roadmap to discovering essential wisdom on living an authentic and meaningful life  Emerson's far-reaching vision of excellence and spiritual flourishing is the medicine we need to heal ourselves. \"Trust yourself,\" he teaches. \"Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen.\" This philosophy of hope, known as transcendentalism, is the vein of gold in the American psyche.  Lessons from an American Stoic  helps us to reclaim our national treasure. "

Until now, the available translations have treated these writings as historical curiosities that have little relevance to our contemporary situations. This new version, made from the hieroglyphs, approaches the Book of the Dead as a profound spiritual text capable of speaking to us today. These writings suggest that the divine realm and the human realm are not altogether separate-they remind us that the natural world, and the substance of our lives, is fashioned from the stuff of the gods. Devoted like an Egyptian scribe to the principle of \"effective utterance,\" Normandi Ellis has produced a prose translation that reads like pure, diaphanous verse. "

Fatal conveniences are the toxic products we routinely use and the unhealthy things we do that our culture and corporations have made us believe are safe and necessary for living well and efficiently. These things\u2014from deodorant, cosmetics, dental floss, and sunscreen to laundry detergent, air fresheners, carpets, and crayons to candles, tea bags, cell phones, and chewing gum\u2014are ubiquitous in daily life . . . and they are wreaking havoc on our health and our planet. The environmental toxins found in these products create a cascade of problems, including chemical sensitivities, auto-immune issues, obesity, chronic health diseases, and more.   Darin Olien has spent most of his adult life obsessively researching these \"conveniences\" and in this book, he raises our awareness of their dangers, demolishes the myth that \"if it's easy, it must also be good,\" and gives us alternative choices to take control of our lives and our health. Fatal Conveniences offers a fresh perspective and achievable, small tweaks that will lead to big, life-enhancing changes.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

On your journey toward a more health-conscious life, you've likely been bombarded by an overwhelming amount of information\u2014from the Kardashian-like wellness influencers who (unrealistically) insist upon sustainably sourced Epsom salt baths every night, to the elite longevity optimizers who measure their lactate levels after a workout. The echo chamber of the internet, and social media algorithms that favor polarizing opinions to drive views and engagement, have hijacked our understanding of health. No matter which corner of the wellness world you inhabit, our social feeds are filled with advice that presumes we all have the same amount of time, money, and resources. In this saturated landscape, how can you avoid the potential scams and dodge the doctors-turned-celebrities to find what really works for you?  Over the past decade, Colleen and Jason Wachob, co-founders of mindbodygreen, have cultivated a leading wellness lifestyle media brand for everyone seeking to cut through this noise, and live a happier, healthier, and greener lifestyle.  The Joy of Well-Being  is a distillation of almost fifteen years of this experience on the forefront of the well-being conversation: they've done the legwork so you don't have to. The Wachobs are a product of their mentors and years of working with hundreds of the world's most brilliant well-being minds, PhDs, MDs, therapists, movement specialists, spiritual leaders, and journalists. They've developed ways to discern meaningful points of information amidst the chaos, an act they consider both a science and an art.  The Joy of Well-Being  is more than a book, it's a reawakening, marking a crucial shift away from the do-this-then-do-that paradigm, to cultivating a joyful lifestyle that centers each individual, and their own health and happiness. True well-being isn't something you chase, it is something you weave together, as each new day presents an opportunity to make choices that support feeling good in your body, in your relationships, and in your life.

                "Templars in America reveals the story of two leading European Templar families who combined forces to create a new commonwealth in America nearly a century before the voyages of Christopher Columbus. Henry St. Clair of the Orkney Islands, then part of Normandy, and Carlo Zeno, a Venetian trader, made peaceful and mutually beneficial contact with the Mi'kmaq people of what is now Canada. Proof of their travels is carved in stone on both sides of the Atlantic and can be found in documentary evidence borne out by a strong oral tradition that has withstood the test of time. Historians Tim Wallace-Murphy and Marilyn Hopkins draw on archival and archaeological evidence to prove the Templar voyage. They then demonstrate how this early contact with the Americas ties into the centuries-long development of the Templars and Freemasonry, which in turn shaped the thinking of the founding fathers-and the American Constitution. Wallace-Murphy and Hopkins also reveal the continuous history of American exploration from the time of ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, through the age of the Vikings. Templars in America is a wild ride from the golden age of exploration to the founding of the United States. "

When clinical psychologist Sarah Mandel was pregnant with her second child, she began preparing for her maternity leave, juggling the demands of her soon-to-be-new baby with the needs of her patients. Noticing a lump in her breast, she assumed it was most likely a clogged milk duct. But a biopsy revealed it was not. When she went into labor, she learned that she had Stage Four cancer\u2014devastating news that forced her to confront terminal illness as she was bringing new life into the world.  But Sarah's illness took a highly improbable turn when, after three months of treatment, her second PET scan showed no evidence of disease. Sarah, however, was unable to celebrate the good news; she was frozen in a dissociated state caused by the emotional whiplash of going from oncology patient to new mother, from a terminal sentence to a shocking reprieve. As a therapist who specialized in trauma work, Sarah had utilized \"narrative therapy\" to help her patients. Now she wondered: Could the treatment that eased her patients' pain successfully help her navigate her own trauma?  Little Earthquakes is a beautiful and thought-provoking debut from a brave and unwavering new voice that captures the mind, sears the soul, and leaves its indelible mark on the heart. "

But the script that worked when we were younger can impact us in different ways as adults and make it tough to get along in the world. \u00a0  \u00a0  Drawing from contemporary understandings in neuroscience and psychology, psychologist Jeff Katzman and Dan O'Connor, cofounder of TheaterSports LA, explore the nature of our personal capacities and limitations. Through an application of ideas from improvisational theater, we can all learn to collaborate with those around us, to think on our feet, and to celebrate our mistakes.  Life Unscripted  offers the reader critical tools to enrich relationships, unleash the imagination, and build a more personally meaningful life. Using exercises like \u201cYes, And,\u201d, \u201cMistakes as Gifts,\u201d and \u201cNo Waffling,\u201d the authors convey practical take-aways for every chapter. "

                "This program is read by the author. Merging the insights of inspiring voices with her own understanding of mindfulness,  New York Times  bestselling author Sharon Salzberg shows us how we can recover from the emotional effects of crisis.  When confronted with pain and obstacles, we often shrink back and contract out of fear and disappointment. That can become a way of life. In  Real Life , Sharon Salzberg lets us know it doesn't have to be that way. When we feel alone, cut off, or trapped, we can let those difficulties steer us onto a path toward an authentic, flourishing life\u2014living in a way that allows us to find the wholeness that lies within. Even when we're alone, a sense of community can accompany us through the stormy times. Our words, hearts, and actions can line up with a larger vision, rather than the smaller views our anxious, fearful thoughts arouse in us. To live in a less constricted way\u2014with a more spacious, open sense of possibility, creativity, connection, and joy\u2014Salzberg says we need to get real about what's most important, to ask ourselves, \"What do I most deeply yearn for?\" \"What would I benefit from letting go of?\" \"What do I believe is possible for me?\" We accomplish the journey to expansive freedom (Real Life) through developing tools like mindful awareness, friendship, and a greater sense of purpose/aspiration. We learn to:   take some risks with what we dare to imagine   take an interest in internal states we might normally try to avoid   take an interest in people we might normally try to avoid  Real Life  is about the journey we make when we decide to live the life that speaks to our innermost longing to live free.

He's gone looking for wisdom, beauty, and truth wherever it can be found. But recently he's found himself learning closer to home-from the teacher-cats he lives with. What he discovered is that our greatest spiritual teachers are at our feet. Literally. They are the cats we love and treasure. Nearly 60 million cats live in US households today. These feline teachers have much to offer us about living in the present, loving unconditionally, approaching life with a sense of playfulness, and trusting others, all the while being independent spirits. Jon Sweeney, beloved scholar and author of The Pope's Cat and numerous books about Saint Francis, offers a playful, gentle, informed meditation on the many spiritual truths and practices our feline companions provide if we but pause and pay attention.
