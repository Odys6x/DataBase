But when they find themselves embroiled in a paranormal phenomenon at school involving plant-faced monster people assimilating innocent victims, it seems they'll have to set aside their differences and work together as best as they can.  Of course, it doesn't help that the only one with any answers to this bizarre situation is a mysterious \"paranormal investigator\" named Akisato, who insists they must find some sort of \"key\" to stop it all \u2014 before giant insects and other preternatural perils from the world \"beyond\" get to them first.

                "A blackout leads two teens to discover the intimacy and vulnerability that can only be shared in darkness in  Our Beautiful Darkness   , a   fully illustrated YA novella from celebrated Angolan author Ondjaki and illustrator   Ant  \u00f3  nio Jorge Gon  \u00e7  alves  .     Translated from Portuguese   by   Lyn Miller-Lachmann    The light goes out suddenly. And in this absence of light, a pair of teenagers bare their souls. Into the warm silence of the night, they share a conversation filled with their stories and dreams... and maybe even a first kiss.    Set against the backdrop of the civil war that ravaged Angola in the 1990s, this book weaves the country's history with a teenage boy's family stories. But when a power outage shrouds the neighborhood in darkness, everyday realities fade away... As the boy and a girl sit talking in the backyard, memory gives way to imagination and vulnerability, and the space between them becomes charged with emotional electricity.    Their resulting conversation is both a meditation on the storytelling impulse and a gripping narrative of first love that, through its particulars, ascends to the universal. "

No one loves and quarrels, desires and deceives as boldly or brilliantly as Greek gods and goddesses.  In Stephen Fry's vivid retelling, we gaze in wonder as wise Athena is born from the cracking open of the great head of Zeus and follow doomed Persephone into the dark and lonely realm of the Underworld. We shiver in fear when Pandora opens her jar of evil torments and watch with joy as the legendary love affair between Eros and Psyche unfolds.  Mythos: The Illustrated Story  captures these extraordinary myths for our modern age in striking colour - in all their dazzling and deeply human relevance. "

Her adventure takes her to a museum full of hints about the planet\u2019s past and the strange glowing mushrooms that grow everywhere, a library that has become home to a variety of zoo animals, and a beautiful but crumbling space station from which she makes a daring escape.

                "Inspired by thousands of years of Chinese thought, an enchanting and heart-opening illustrated fable about a young boy who explores the many ways to make meaning and find joy in the everyday.   Sometimes you can only do a small, small thing. And that can make all the difference.  In this exquisitely illustrated parable grounded in the three pillars of Chinese philosophy, a young boy, his family ox, and a rabbit living in his garden help each other navigate the daily work of love, compassion, and community. Examining the world through the lenses of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism, their conversations convey tender, uplifting messages for life's various crossroads. As they adopt a sparrow, bathe in rivers, comfort their neighbors, and tend to their chores, the\u00a0characters\u2019 different perspectives are reflected in their conversations: the boy\u2019s Taoist love of nature and all it entails, the ox\u2019s Buddhist compassion for others, and the rabbit\u2019s Confucian practice of mutual respect and care. While they don't always agree, the friends settle on the basic truth that purpose comes from simply engaging with life\u2014and with each other. Painted in a contemporary gongbi style, one of the oldest continuous art forms in the world, the atmospheric illustrations from Taiwanese American artist Regina Linke conjure a timeless, mystical land where the friends have made their home. The potent combination of magnificent art and gentle revelations will capture the hearts of readers, whatever their age. "

At the Hellfire Gala, the New Mutants have the chance to take a break from training the youth of Krakoa - an opportunity to get dressed up and get down! But not everyone is on their best behavior - and someone is about to vanish without a trace. In the heart of the Wild Hunt, schemers are dreaming, deceptions are coming to light and the dead are walking. As the New Mutants gear up for their biggest battle yet - and start to turn on each other in the process - mayhem is in the making on the moon! Something is creeping in the long lunar shadows of the Summer House, and our young heroes will soon come face-to-face with it. When Amahl Farouk executes his master plan, will it be the end of the New Mutants?. "
