                "From one of Canada's most celebrated writers, two-time Giller Prize winner M.G. Vassanji, comes a thoughtful meditation on what it means to belong in the world.   Home is never a single place, entirely and unequivocally. It is contingent. The abstract \"nowhere,\" then, is the true home.  M.G. Vassanji has been exploring the immigrant experience for over three decades, drawing deeply on his own transnational upbringing and intimate understanding of the unique challenges and perspectives born from leaving one's home to resettle in a new land. The question of identity, of how to configure and see oneself within this new land, is one such challenge faced. But Vassanji suggests that a more fundamental and slippery endeavour than establishing one's identity is how, if ever, we can establish a sense of belonging. Can we ever truly belong in this new home? Did we ever truly belong in the home we left? Where exactly do we belong? For many, the answer is nowhere exactly.\u00a0 Combining brilliant prose, thoughtful, candid observation, and a lifetime of exploring how we as individuals are shaped by the places and communities in which we live and the history that haunts them,  Nowhere, Exactly  examines with exquisite sensitivity the space between identity and belonging, the immigrant experience of both loss and gain, and the weight of memory and nostalgia, guilt and hope felt by so many of those who leave their homes in search of new ones.

                "The Millions \" Most Anticipated\" Books of 2023   Never-before-seen unpublished works by award-winning American literary icon Ntozake Shange, featuring essays, plays, and poems from the archives of the seminal Black feminist writer who stands alongside giants like Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, curated by National Book Award winner Imani Perry with a foreword by  New York Times  bestselling author Tarana Burke.     In the late '60s, Ntozake Shange was a student at Barnard College discovering her budding talent as a writer, publishing in her school's literary journal, and finding her unique voice. By the time she left us in 2018, Shange had scorched blazing trails across countless pages and stages, redefining genre and form as we know them, each verse, dance, and song a love letter to Black women and girls, and the community at large.   Sing a Black   Girl's   Song  is a new posthumous collection of Shange's unpublished poems, essays, and plays from throughout the life of the seminal Black feminist writer. In these pages we meet young Shange, learn the moments that inspired  for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf...,  travel with an eclectic family of musicians, sit on \"The Couch\" opposite Shange's therapist, and discover plays written after  for colored girls'  international success.  Sing a Black Girl's Song  houses, in their original form, the literary rebel's politically charged verses from the Black Arts Movement era alongside her signature tender rhythm and cadence that capture the minutia and nuance of Black life.  Sing a Black Girl's Song  is the continuation of a literary tradition that has bolstered generations of writers and a long-lasting gift from one of the fiercest and most highly celebrated artists of our time.

Several authors featured are translated into English for the first time. Grammy, National Book Award, Cervantes, and Pulitzer Prize winners as well as a Nobel Laureate and the next generation of literary voices are among the stars of this essential collection, women whose work inspires and transforms us.  An eclectic and inclusive time capsule spanning centuries, genres, and geographical and linguistic diversity, Daughters of Latin America is divided into 13 parts representing the 13 Mayan Moons, each cycle honoring a different theme.

More than a collection of writings, Daughters of Latin America is a resurrection of ancestral literary inheritance as well as a celebration of the rising voices encouraged and nurtured by those who came before them.

                "As deeply rewarding as her fiction, More to Say presents a selection of Ann Beattie's essays, chosen and introduced by the author. From appreciations of writers, photographers, and other artists, to notes on the craft of writing itself, this is a wide-ranging, and always penetrating collection of writing never before published in book form.  Ann Beattie, a master storyteller, has been delighting readers since the publication of her short stories in the 1970s and her first novel, Chilly Scenes of Winter. But as her literary acclaim grew and she was hailed \"the voice of her generation,\" Beattie was also moonlighting as a nonfiction writer.  These penetrating essays are stories unto themselves, closely observed appreciations of life and art. The listener travels with Beattie to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to learn about the legacy of the painter Grant Wood and his iconic painting American Gothic; to the famed University of Virginia campus with her husband, the painter Lincoln Perry; to Key West, Florida, for New Years with writer and translator Harry Mathews; to a roadside near Boston in a broken-down car with the wheelchair-bound writer Andr\u00e9 Dubus. There are explorations of novels, short stories, paintings, and photographs by artists ranging from Alice Munro to Elmore Leonard, from Sally Mann to John Loengard. Whatever the subject, Ms. Beattie brings penetrating insight into literature and art that's both familiar and unfamiliar.  Ann Beattie's nonfiction is a new way to enjoy one of the great writers of her generation. Listeners will find much to love in this journey with a curious and fascinating mind. "

SPEECHES OF NOTE: seventy-five extraordinary ways to step into someone else's shoes.      From Shaun Usher, the author of the international bestseller LETTERS OF NOTE, comes an obsessively curated, richly illustrated and sumptuously produced collection of speeches from throughout the ages.       Discover speeches that altered the course of history , like  NELSON MANDELA 's on the day he became South Africa's first black President, and outpourings of much-needed change, such as the impassioned, impromptu appeal for women's rights from  SOJOURNER TRUTH , an African-American woman born into slavery. Expect the gloriously unexpected, as  KERMIT THE FROG  takes to the podium, and celebrate lives well-lived, including  TILDA SWINTON 's tribute to 'every alien's favourite cousin',  DAVID BOWIE .   While some speeches are heard by millions, some remain unspoken : the secret draft prepared for  QUEEN ELIZABETH II  during a military exercise for World War III, and  PRESIDENT NIXON 's chilling public announcement should  NEIL ARMSTRONG  and  BUZZ ALDRIN  become stranded on the Moon.   Surprising, inspiring and shocking; moving, comforting and enlightening.

And is it fair? \u2022\u00a0What do zombies have to do with authoritarianism?  In more than fifty pieces, Atwood aims her prodigious intellect and impish humour at the world, and reports back to us on what she finds. This roller-coaster period brought the end of history, a financial crash, the rise of Trump, and a pandemic. From debt to tech, the climate crisis to freedom; from when to dispense advice to the young (answer: only when asked) to how to define granola, we have no better guide to the many and varied mysteries of our universe.

                "\"The heroes and heroines who triumph in his stories are not those with the most powerful magic, but rather those who demonstrate the most kindness, common sense and ingenuity.\"  As every fan of the Harry Potter stories knows, the shelves of the Hogwarts Library are home to all sorts of fascinating books. There are three in particular you might have heard mentioned by certain Hogwarts students, and that you can add to your listening list too, including  The Tales of Beedle the Bard . As familiar to Hogwarts students as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty are to Muggle children, Beedle's stories are a collection of popular fairy tales written for young witches and wizards. So, if you're wondering what's in store... well, your ears are in for a treat.  Once you've checked this fabulous Hogwarts Library book out, you'll start by hearing the author's introduction, read by Sally Mortemore (librarian Madam Pince from the  Harry Potter  films). Then it's time for the tales to begin... You'll laugh along to  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot  as you listen to the havoc wreaked by a father's impish gift to his son, read by Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick -  Harry Potter  films).  The Fountain of Fair Fortune  will take you on a quest through an enchanted garden, alongside three witches and a luckless knight, read by Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood -  Harry Potter  films). In  The Warlock's Hairy Heart  you'll be warned about a young warlock who is fearful of love, and turns to dark magic to avoid it at all costs, read by Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy -  Harry Potter  films). The calamitous meeting of a foolish king, a cunning charlatan and a mischievous washerwoman unravels in  Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump , read by Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley -  Harry Potter ). And finally, the most iconic of Beedle's stories.  The Tale of the Three Brothers  - with its message of humility and wisdom - will introduce you, dear listener, to the Deathly Hallows, read by Noma Dumezweni (Hermione Granger -  Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , London's West End and New York's Broadway). Each of the tales is accompanied by wise and whimsical notes from a certain Albus Dumbledore, surely everyone's favourite headmaster, read by Jude Law (Albus Dumbledore -  Fantastic Beasts  films).  We're told these five fables have been firm favourites in wizarding households for centuries, and now it's your turn to experience these tales from the Wizarding World, as you've never heard them before. Fans of  The Tales of Beedle the Bard  are sure to enjoy the other Hogwarts Library books:  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them  and  Quidditch Through the Ages .   At least 90% of the proceeds* received by Pottermore Limited from this audiobook will be made available by the publisher to The Lumos Foundation for their work to help children worldwide out of institutions, so they can thrive in loving families and communities. The Lumos Foundation is a charity registered in England and Wales with registered charity number 1112575 and in the USA (EIN 47-2301085) .    *Proceeds means the cash-price or cash equivalent price less sales taxes.  Around the world, more than 8 million children live in orphanages and other institutions. What may be surprising is that about 80 percent of them aren't actually orphans. They have family who could care for them, with the right support. Lumos is an international children's charity founded by J.K. Rowling. Named after the light-giving spell in Harry Potter, Lumos' mission is to ensure that by 2050 all children will grow up in loving, protective... "

                "With unwavering humanity and light-footed humor, this intimate account of the interminable year of 2020 offers commentary on the COVID-19 pandemic, protests for racial justice, the U.S. presidential election, and more, all with a miraculous dose of groundedness in head-spinning times. From the award-winning book critic and best-selling author.\u00a0 \"This book is so funny and so true. Charles Finch unpacks a year of plague, fear, shameless venality, and dizzying stupidity with an irrepressible wit and surgically precise cultural observations. I didn't know how badly I needed exactly this. Maybe you do too?\" \u2014Joe Hill, author of  Heart-Shaped Box       In March 2020, at the request of the  Los Angeles Times,  Charles Finch became a reluctant diarist: As California sheltered in place, he began to write daily notes about the odd ambient changes in his own life and in the lives around him. The result is  What Just Happened.  \u00a0 In a warm, candid, welcoming voice, and in the tradition of Woolf and Orwell, Finch brings us into his own world: taking long evening walks near his home in L.A., listening to music, and keeping virtual connections with friends across the country as they each experience the crisis. And drawing on his remarkable acuity as a cultural critic, he chronicles one endless year with delightful commentary on current events, and the things that distract him from current events: Murakami\u2019s novels, reality television, the Beatles.\u00a0 \u00a0  What Just Happened  is a work of empathy and insight, at once of-the-moment and timeless\u2014a gift from one of our culture's most original thinkers.

                "A compelling and provocative essay collection that smashes stereotypes and redefines the meaning of the term \"horse girl,\" broadening it for women of all cultural backgrounds.  As a child, horses consumed Halimah Marcus' imagination. When she wasn't around horses she was pretending to be one, cantering on two legs, hands poised to hold invisible reins. To her classmates, girls like Halimah were known as \"horse girls,\" weird and overzealous, absent from the social worlds of their peers.   Decades later, when memes about \"horse girl energy,\" began appearing across social media\u2014Halimah reluctantly recognized herself. The jokes imagine girls as blinkered as carriage ponies, oblivious to the mockery behind their backs. The stereotypical horse girl is also white, thin, rich, and straight, a daughter of privilege. Yet so many riders don't fit this narrow, damaging ideal, and relate to horses in profound ways that include ambivalence and regret, as well as unbridled passion and devotion.  Featuring some of the most striking voices in contemporary literature\u2014including Carmen Maria Machado, Pulitzer-prize winner Jane Smiley, T Kira Madden, Maggie Shipstead, and Courtney Maum\u2014Horse Girls reframes the iconic bond between girls and horses with the complexity and nuance it deserves. And it showcases powerful emerging voices like Braudie Blais-Billie, on the connection between her Seminole and Quebecois heritage; Sarah Enelow-Snyder, on growing up as a Black barrel racer in central Texas; and Nur Nasreen Ibrahim, on the colonialist influence on horse culture in Pakistan.  By turns thought-provoking and personal, Horse Girls reclaims its titular stereotype to ask bold questions about autonomy and desire, privilege and ambition, identity and freedom, and the competing forces of domestication and wildness.

                "A bewitchingly brilliant collection of never-before-published letters from the renowned author of \u201cThe Lottery\u201d and  The Haunting of Hill House     i must stop writing letters and get to writing a novel.   Shirley Jackson is one of the most important American authors of the last hundred years and among our greatest chroniclers of the female experience. This extraordinary compilation of personal correspondence has all the hallmarks of Jackson\u2019s beloved fiction: flashes of the uncanny in the domestic, sparks of horror in the quotidian, and the veins of humor that run through good times and bad.  i am having a fine time doing a novel with my left hand and a long story\u2014with as many levels as grand central station\u2014with my right hand, stirring chocolate pudding with a spoon held in my teeth, and tuning the television with both feet.   Written over the course of nearly three decades, from Jackson\u2019s college years to six days before her early death at the age of forty-eight, these letters become the autobiography Shirley Jackson never wrote. As well as being a bestselling author, Jackson spent much of her adult life as a mother of four in Vermont, and the landscape here is often the everyday: raucous holidays and trips to the dentist, overdue taxes and frayed lines of Christmas lights, new dogs and new babies. But in recounting these events to family, friends, and colleagues, she turns them into remarkable stories: entertaining, revealing, and wise. At the same time, many of these letters provide fresh insight into the genesis and progress of Jackson\u2019s writing over nearly three decades.  The novel is getting sadder. It\u2019s always such a strange feeling\u2014I know something\u2019s going to happen, and those poor people in the book don\u2019t; they just go blithely on their ways.   Compiled and edited by her elder son, Laurence Jackson Hyman, in consultation with Jackson scholar Bernice M. Murphy, this intimate collection holds the beguiling prism of Shirley Jackson\u2014writer and reader, mother and daughter, neighbor and wife\u2014up to the light. "

Now, with  Festival Days,  Beard brings us the culmination of her groundbreaking work. In these nine pieces, she captures both the small, luminous moments of daily existence and those instants when life and death hang in the balance, ranging from the death of a beloved dog to a relentlessly readable account of a New York artist trapped inside a burning building, as well as two triumphant, celebrated pieces of short fiction.   Here is an unforgettable collection destined to be embraced and debated by readers and writers, teachers and students. Anchored by the title piece\u2013\u2013a searing journey through India that brings into focus questions of mortality and love\u2014 Festival Days  presents Beard at the height of her powers, using her flawless prose to reveal all that is tender and timeless beneath the way we live now.

Throughout Proust's life, nine of his short stories remained unseen-the writer never spoke of them. Why did he choose not to publish them along with the others? One possible answer is that he was developing his themes in preparation for his masterpiece, In Search of Lost Time; another is that the stories were too audacious-too near to life-for the censorious society of the time. In these stories, published here for the first time, we find an intimate picture of a young author full of darkness and melancholy, longing to reveal his true self to the world. "

                "A flicker of light almost appears at the end of the tunnel for prisoner FF8282, as he is transferred to North Sea Camp near Boston, Lincolnshire, a D-category prison. Under a less strict regime, the prisoners can enjoy a more relaxed set of rules, while slowly preparing to someday rejoin the world outside the walls. However, a minor breach of conditions gets him sent off to the notorious HMP Lincoln facility for twenty-two days, where more traumatic experiences await. \"Heaven\" is the third book in Jeffrey Archer's bestselling series The Prison Diaries. In this final volume Archer reflects on his time spent in prison, leading up to his release on parole in July 2003. An eye-opening insight into prison life, exploring the humanity to be found behind bars, while simultaneously highlighting a system failing society as a whole and as individuals, where inmates leave worse off and more dangerous than when they first entered. Jeffrey Archer is a bestselling British author and former politician. He was educated at Oxford and went on to become a Member of Parliament, the deputy chair of the Conservative Party as well as sitting in the House of Lords. His political career ended in scandal and he turned to writing and he has been published in over 275 million copies worldwide. He is perhaps most famous for the \"Clifton Chronicles\" and his blockbuster \"Kane and Abel\" which was number one on the New York Time's Bestseller list and inspired a popular miniseries starring Peter Strauss and Sam Neill. After he was imprisoned for perjury in 2001, he wrote his highly acclaimed non-fiction series, Prison Diaries \u2013 \"Hell\", \"Purgatory\" and \"Heaven\" \u2013 which were inspired by his experiences and loosely structured around Dante's Divine Comedy.

                "Prisoner FF8282 gazes out from confinement on what he deems must be a glorious summer's day, rays of sunlight bursting through the barred windows of his cell. Within the thick prison walls separating society from its dangerous criminals, a multitude of harrowing fates unfold, seldomly explored by the public. First-time offenders thrown in cells with hardened criminals, several inmates becoming heroin addicts and a system riddled with flaws. However, even in prison the sunlight cannot be kept out. Thursday 19 July 2001, following a seven-week perjury trial, international, bestselling author Jeffrey Archer was sentenced to four years in prison; the first twenty-two days and fourteen hours of which were spent in the notorious HMP Belmarsh facility in south London. This experience led to Archer's best-selling volumes, The Prison Diaries, a detailed, hour-by-hour recollection of his time spent amongst criminals in the high-security prison, housing murderers, terrorists and some of Britain's most violent criminals. Still under these harsh circumstances, Archer manages to show that like the rays of sunlight pushing through heavy bars, humanity can be found even in the inferno of hell. \"Hell\" is the first volume in the series, offering the author's firsthand depiction of prison life, while simultaneously highlighting a system failing society as a whole and as individuals, where inmates leave worse off and more dangerous than when they first entered.

                "Long days of boredom in confinement, the general inefficiency of prison bureaucracy and a critically over-stretched prison service. The tediousness of prison life kicks in for prisoner FF8282, also known as author Jeffrey Archer, in the second volume of his best-selling series The Prison Diaries. Still his fellow inmates show inspiring spirit and courage, amid an otherwise gloomy prison landscape, revealing that even in the darkest hours light can always be found. In 2001 August 9th, Jeffrey Archer is transferred from HMP Belmarsh, a double-A Category high-security prison in south London, to HMP Wayland, a Category C establishment in Norfolk. Though more relaxed in terms of rules prison life still is no picnic, but rather a purgatory. During his sixty-seven days in Wayland, Archer reveals the harsh details of everyday life in Britain's prisons, offering firsthand insight into the lives led behind bars. Jeffrey Archer is a bestselling British author and former politician. He was educated at Oxford and went on to become a Member of Parliament, the deputy chair of the Conservative Party as well as sitting in the House of Lords.

                "A Chinese  Lord of the Rings  and one of the all-time great fantasy novels\u2014which Neil Gaiman has said \"is in the DNA of 1.5 billion people\"\u2014now in a thrilling new translation  A shape-shifting trickster on a kung-fu quest for eternal life, Monkey King is one of the most memorable superheroes in world literature. High-spirited and omni-talented, he amasses dazzling weapons and skills on his journey to immortality: a gold-hooped staff that can grow as tall as the sky and shrink to the size of a needle; the ability to travel 108,000 miles in a single somersault. A master of subterfuge, he can transform himself into whomever or whatever he chooses and turn each of his body's 84,000 hairs into an army of clones. But his penchant for mischief repeatedly gets him into trouble, and when he raids Heaven's Orchard of Immortal Peaches and gorges himself on the elixirs of the gods, the Buddha pins him beneath a mountain, freeing him only five hundred years later for a chance to redeem himself: He is to protect the pious monk Tripitaka on his fourteen-year journey to India in search of precious Buddhist sutras that will bring enlightenment to the Chinese empire. Joined by two other fallen immortals\u2014Pigsy, a rice-loving pig able to fly with its ears, and Sandy, a depressive man-eating river-sand monster\u2014Monkey King undergoes eighty-one trials, doing battle with Red Boy, Princess Jade-Face, the Monstress Dowager, and all manner of dragons, ogres, wizards, and  femmes fatales,  navigating the perils of Fire-Cloud Cave, the River of Flowing Sand, the Water-Crystal Palace, and Casserole Mountain, and being serially captured, lacquered, saut\u00e9ed, steamed, and liquefied, but always hatching an ingenious plan to get himself and his fellow pilgrims out of their latest jam.  Monkey King: Journey to the West  is at once a rollicking adventure, a comic satire of Chinese bureaucracy, and a spring of spiritual insight. With this new translation, the irrepressible rogue hero of one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature has the potential to vault, with his signature cloud-somersault and unerring sense for fun, into the hearts of millions of Americans.

                "In 1701, young Lord Asano is goaded into attacking a corrupt official at the Japanese Court. Although the wound Asano inflicts is minimal, the Emperor's punishment is harsh: Lord Asano is ordered to commit seppuku, or ritual suicide. His lands are confiscated and his family is dishonored and exiled. His samurai retainers now become ronin, or masterless, and are dispersed. These ronin are not trusted by their enemies, and live under the watchful eyes of spies for months. They appear to adapt to their new circumstances by becoming tradesmen and teachers. But the ronin only seem to accept their fate. They are in fact making careful plans for revenge, biding their time until the moment to strike is right! Their deeds became Japan's most celebrated example of bravery, cunning, and loyalty in an age when samurai were heroes, and honor was worth dying for. John Allyn's masterful retelling of 47 Ronin has long been considered the definitive version of these dramatic historical events. "

                "Five stories from influential women writers of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century. New Zealand-born Katherine Mansfield settled in England where she wrote a series of short stories that are widely recognised as among the finest of the twentieth century for their economy, clarity, sensitivity and effect. 'The Garden Party' is one of her most famous, while 'Daughters of the Late Colonel' shows a wonderful sense of wit. Kate Chopin, writing in the last years of the nineteenth century, broke new ground with her daring view of women as individuals with human needs. 'Lilacs' and 'Ma'ame Pelagie' are sympathetic portraits of women with differing dilemmas. Woolf's 'A Mark on the Wall' shows, in short story form, the turmoil within the stillness which became such a mark of her later novels. "

                "Katie Roiphe, culture writer and author of  The Morning After , shares a timely blend of memoir, feminist investigation, and exploration in famous female writers' lives, in a bold, essential discussion of how strong women experience their power.   Told in a series of notebook entries, Roiphe weaves her often fraught personal experiences with divorce, single motherhood, and relationships with insights into the lives and loves of famous writers such as Sylvia Plath and Simone de Beauvoir. She dissects the way she and other ordinary, powerful women have subjugated their own power time and time again, and she probes brilliantly at the tricky, uncomfortable question of  why.    In these informal musings and notes, Roiphe delves into treacherous, largely untalked about, contradictions of contemporary womanhood, going where few writers dare.  The Power Notebooks  is Roiphe's most vital, thought provoking, and emotionally intimate work yet. "

In this collection, award-winning and bestselling authors reimagine their favorite classic stories, the ones that have inspired, awed, and enraged them, the ones that have become ingrained in modern culture, and the ones that have been too long overlooked. They take these stories and boil them down to their bones, and reassemble them for a new generation of readers.   Written from a twenty-first century perspective and set within the realms of science fiction, dystopian fiction, fantasy, and realistic fiction, these short stories are as moving and thought provoking as their originators. They pay homage to groundbreaking literary achievements of the past while celebrating each author's unique perception and innovative style. "

                "*Most Anticipated Reads of 2019 Selection by Publishers Weekly, BuzzFeed, The Rumpus, Lit Hub, The Week, and Elle.com* Fifteen brilliant writers explore what we don't talk to our mothers about, and how it affects us, for better or for worse.As an undergraduate, Michele Filgate started writing an essay about being abused by her stepfather. It took her more than a decade to realize what she was actually trying to write: how this affected her relationship with her mother. When it was finally published, the essay went viral, shared on social media by Anne Lamott, Rebecca Solnit, and many others. The outpouring of responses gave Filgate an idea, and the resulting anthology offers a candid look at our relationships with our mothers.  While some of the writers in this book are estranged from their mothers, others are extremely close. Leslie Jamison writes about trying to discover who her seemingly perfect mother was before ever becoming a mom. In Cathi Hanauer's hilarious piece, she finally gets a chance to have a conversation with her mother that isn't interrupted by her domineering (but lovable) father. Andr\u00e9 Aciman writes about what it was like to have a deaf mother. Melissa Febos uses mythology as a lens to look at her close-knit relationship with her psychotherapist mother. And Julianna Baggott talks about having a mom who tells her everything.  As Filgate writes, \"Our mothers are our first homes, and that's why we're always trying to return to them.\" There's relief in breaking the silence. Acknowledging what we couldn't say for so long is one way to heal our relationships with others and, perhaps most important, with ourselves.  Contributors include Cathi Hanauer, Melissa Febos, Alexander Chee, Dylan Landis, Bernice L. McFadden, Julianna Baggott, Lynn Steger Strong, Kiese Laymon, Carmen Maria Machado, Andr\u00e9 Aciman, Sari Botton, Nayomi Munaweera, Brandon Taylor, and Leslie Jamison. "

                "More of Mason Currey's irresistible Daily Rituals, this time exploring the daily obstacles and rituals of women who are artists\u2014painters, composers, sculptors, scientists, filmmakers, and performers. We see how these brilliant minds get to work, the choices they have to make: rebuffing convention, stealing (or secreting away) time from the pull of husbands, wives, children, obligations, in order to create their creations.From those who are the masters of their craft (Eudora Welty, Lynn Fontanne, Penelope Fitzgerald, Marie Curie) to those who were recognized in a burst of acclaim (Lorraine Hansberry, Zadie Smith) . . . from Clara Schumann and Shirley Jackson, carving out small amounts of time from family life, to Isadora Duncan and Agnes Martin, rejecting the demands of domesticity, Currey shows us the large and small (and abiding) choices these women made\u2014and continue to make\u2014for their art: Isak Dinesen, \"I promised the Devil my soul, and in return he promised me that everything I was going to experience would be turned into tales,\" Dinesen subsisting on oysters and Champagne but also amphetamines, which gave her the overdrive she required . . . And the rituals (daily and otherwise) that guide these artists: Isabel Allende starting a new book only on January 8th . . . Hilary Mantel taking a shower to combat writers' block (\"I am the cleanest person I know\") . . . Tallulah Bankhead coping with her three phobias (hating to go to bed, hating to get up, and hating to be alone), which, could she \"mute them,\" would make her life \"as slick as a sonnet, but as dull as ditch water\" . . . Lillian Hellman chain-smoking three packs of cigarettes and drinking twenty cups of coffee a day\u2014and, after milking the cow and cleaning the barn, writing out of \"elation, depression, hope\" (\"That is the exact order. Hope sets in toward nightfall. That's when you tell yourself that you're going to be better the next time, so help you God.\") . . . Diane Arbus, doing what \"gnaws at\" her . . . Colette, locked in her writing room by her first husband, Henry Gauthier-Villars (nom de plume: Willy) and not being \"let out\" until completing her daily quota (she wrote five pages a day and threw away the fifth). Colette later said, \"A prison is one of the best workshops\" . . . Jessye Norman disdaining routines or rituals of any kind, seeing them as \"a crutch\" . . . and Octavia Butler writing every day no matter what (\"screw inspiration\").  Germaine de Sta\u00ebl . . . Elizabeth Barrett Browning . . . George Eliot . . . Edith Wharton . . . Virginia Woolf . . . Edna Ferber . . . Doris Lessing . . . Pina Bausch . . . Frida Kahlo . . . Marguerite Duras . . . Helen Frankenthaler . . . Patti Smith, and 131 more\u2014on their daily routines, superstitions, fears, eating (and drinking) habits, and other finely (and not so finely) calibrated rituals that help summon up willpower and self-discipline, keeping themselves afloat with optimism and fight, as they create (and avoid creating) their creations.

                "From one of China's most famous contemporary writers, who celebrated novel To Live catapulted him to international fame, here is a stunning collection of stories, selected from the best of Yu Hua's early work, that shows his far-reaching influence on a pivotal period in Chinese literature.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yu Hua and other young Chinese writers began to reimagine their national literature. Departing from conventional realism in favor of a more surreal and subjective approach inspired by Kafka, Faulkner, and Borges, the boundary-pushing fiction of this period reflected the momentous cultural changes sweeping the world's most populous nation.  The stories collected here show Yu Hua masterfully guiding us from one fractured reality to another. \"A History of Two People\" traces the paths of a man and a woman who dream in parallel throughout their lives. \"In Memory of Miss Willow Yang\" weaves a spellbinding web of signs and symbols. \"As the North Wind Howled\" carries a case of mistaken identity to absurd and hilarious conclusions. And the title story follows an unforgettable narrator determined to unearth a conspiracy against him that may not exist. By turns daring, darkly comic, thought-provoking, and profound, The April 3rd Incident is an extraordinary record of a singular moment in Chinese letters. "

                "An inspiring collection of essays by black women writers, curated by the founder of the popular book club Well-Read Black Girl, on the importance of recognizing ourselves in literature. Remember that moment when you first encountered a character who seemed to be written just for you? That feeling of belonging remains with readers the rest of their lives\u2014but not everyone regularly sees themselves on the pages of a book. In this timely anthology, Glory Edim brings together original essays by some of our best black women writers to shine a light on how important it is that we all\u2014regardless of gender, race, religion, or ability\u2014have the opportunity to find ourselves in literature.  Contributors include Jesmyn Ward (Sing, Unburied, Sing), Lynn Nottage (Sweat), Jacqueline Woodson (Another Brooklyn), Gabourey Sidibe (This Is Just My Face), Morgan Jerkins (This Will Be My Undoing), Tayari Jones (An American Marriage), Rebecca Walker (Black, White and Jewish), and Barbara Smith (Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology) Whether it's learning about the complexities of femalehood from Zora Neale Hurston and Toni Morrison, finding a new type of love in The Color Purple, or using mythology to craft an alternative black future, the subjects of each essay remind us why we turn to books in times of both struggle and relaxation. As she has done with her book club\u2013turned\u2013online community Well-Read Black Girl, in this anthology Glory Edim has created a space in which black women's writing and knowledge and life experiences are lifted up, to be shared with all readers who value the power of a story to help us understand the world and ourselves.

                "Experience the timeless wit and wisdom of Eleanor Roosevelt in this annotated collection of candid advice columns that she wrote for more than twenty years.In 1941, Eleanor Roosevelt embarked on a new career as an advice columnist. She had already transformed the role of first lady with her regular press conferences, her activism on behalf of women, minorities, and youth, her lecture tours, and her syndicated newspaper column. When Ladies Home Journal offered her an advice column, she embraced it as yet another way for her to connect with the public. \"If You Ask Me\" quickly became a lifeline for Americans of all ages. Over the twenty years that Eleanor wrote her advice column, no question was too trivial and no topic was out of bounds. Practical, warm-hearted, and often witty, Eleanor's answers were so forthright her editors included a disclaimer that her views were not necessarily those of the magazines or the Roosevelt administration. Asked, for example, if she had any Republican friends, she replied, \"I hope so.\" Queried about whether or when she would retire, she said, \"I never plan ahead.\" As for the suggestion that federal or state governments build public bomb shelters, she considered the idea \"nonsense.\" Covering a wide variety of topics\u2014everything from war, peace, and politics to love, marriage, religion, and popular culture\u2014these columns reveal Eleanor Roosevelt's warmth, humanity, and timeless relevance.

Refusing to be tied down to either fiction or the essay form, Artful is narrated by a character who is haunted&#8212;literally&#8212;by a former lover, the writer of a series of lectures about art and literature. Full of both the poignancy and humour of fiction and all the sideways insights and jaunty angles you would expect from Ali Smith's criticism, it explores form, style, life, love, death, mortality, immortality and what art and writing can mean.

Editor-in-Chief Alexandra Shulman kept a diary of British Vogue's Centenary year. And what a year. She reveals the emotional and logistical minefield of producing the 100th anniversary issue (that Duchess of Cambridge cover surprise), organizing the star-studded Vogue 100 Gala, working with designers from Victoria Beckham to Karl Lagerfeld and contributors from David Bailey to Alexa Chung. All under the continual scrutiny of a television documentary crew. But narrowly-contained domestic chaos hovers - spontaneous combustion in the kitchen, a temperamental boiler and having to send bin day reminders all the way from Milan fashion week. For anyone who wants to know what the life of a fashion magazine editor is really like, or for any woman who loves her job, this is a rich, honest and sharply observed account of a year lived at the centre of British fashion and culture.

Meg Waite Clayton (The Race for Paris) and M. J. Rose (The Book of Lost Fragrances) share the romantic secrets that have made Paris the destination for lovers for hundreds of years. Susan Vreeland (The Girl in Hyacinth Blue) and J. Courtney Sullivan (The Engagements) peek behind the stereotype of snobbish Parisians to show us the genuine kindness of real people. From book club favorites Paula McLain, Therese Anne Fowler (Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald), and anthology editor Eleanor Brown (The Light of Paris) to mystery writer Cara Black (Murder in the Marais), historical author Lauren Willig (The Secret History of the Pink Carnation), and memoirist Julie Powell (Julie and Julia), these Parisian memoirs range from laugh-out-loud funny to wistfully romantic to thoughtfully somber and reflective. Perfect for armchair travelers and veterans of Parisian pilgrimages alike, readers will delight in these brand-new tales from their most beloved authors. "

This new volume of Pat Conroy's nonfiction brings together some of the most charming interviews, magazine articles, speeches, and letters from his long literary career, many of them addressed directly to his readers with his habitual greeting, \"Hey, out there.\" Ranging across diverse subjects, such as favorite recent reads, the challenge of staying motivated to exercise, and processing the loss of dear friends, Conroy's eminently memorable pieces offer a unique window into the life of a true titan of Southern writing.With a beautiful introduction from his widow, novelist Cassandra King, A Lowcountry Heart also honors Conroy's legacy and the innumerable lives he touched. Finally, the collection turns to remembrances of \"The Great Conroy,\" as he is lovingly titled by friends, and concludes with a eulogy. The inarguable power of Conroy's work resonates throughout A Lowcountry Heart, and his influence promises to endure.This moving tribute is sure to be a cherished keepsake for any true Conroy fan and remain a lasting monument to one of the best-loved masters of contemporary American letters.From the Hardcover edition.

The varying viewpoints of those he encounters and interviews offer a revealing look at the history and challenges of Israel, and Bellow's passionate storytelling draws listeners in to share in his experience.

The only child of reclusive Holocaust-survivor parents who were dismayed by her literary studies, she found herself dumped by her boyfriend and bombing out of graduate school. Then, one night, she crashed a Shakespeare recitation party. Loopy from vodka and never having read a single line of Shakespeare, she was transfixed. Shakespeare, she decided, was the lifeline she needed.  Green World  is the hilarious and heartbreaking story of Ephraim's quest to become a Shakespeare scholar and to find community and home. As she studies Shakespeare, Ephraim's world uncannily begins to mirror the story of the Jewish daughter in  The Merchant of Venice , and she finds herself in a Green World, an idyllic place where Shakespeare's heroines escape their family trauma.  Green World  reckons with global, historical, and personal tragedy and shows how literature\u2014comic and tragic\u2014can help us brave every kind of anguish. "

Yet fewer know of Maclean's lifelong struggles to reconcile very different parts of himself: the revered teacher and writer in the intellectual hub of Chicago and the Montana man compelled by the wildness and traumas of his home state and family, including the tragic Mann Gulch fire and the murder of his brother. Rebecca McCarthy's intimate portrait of Maclean draws on her long friendship with the author from the time she became a student at the University of Chicago through the rest of his life. Irrepressible as a teacher, Maclean shared guidance, advice, campus and city rambles, and loyal friendship with generations of students. Behind the scenes, he honed an art as meditative and patient as his approach to fly fishing. McCarthy's experiences intertwine with stories from friends, family, colleagues, and others to detail an incredibly rich life that seemed destined to remain divided\u2014until the creation of his classic American story. A vivid evocation of an iconic figure, Norman Maclean reveals the forces and events that shaped the author-educator and formed the bedrock of his beloved stories. "

Wonderfully narrated by Karen Chilton,  Afrofuturism  is an engaging, hip, and accessible primer to the music, literature, and art of Afrofuturism. Author Ytasha Womack introduces listeners to the burgeoning community of artists creating Afrofuturist works. She writes engagingly about the innovators from the past and the wide range of subjects they explore - from the sci-fi literature of Samuel Delany, Octavia Butler, and N. K. Jemisin to the musical cosmos of Sun Ra, George Clinton, and the Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am, to the visual and multimedia artists inspired by African Dogon myths and Egyptian deities.   The audiobook's topics range from the \"alien\" experience of blacks in America to the \"wake up\" cry that peppers sci-fi literature, sermons, and activism. With an aim to both entertain and enlighten, Afrofuturists strive to break down racial, ethnic, and social limitations to empower and free individuals to be themselves.   Karen Chilton is an experienced, warm, and dynamic actor who has narrated many excellent audiobook recordings. She was the reader of the 2017 Audiofile Earphones Award-winning  The March Against Fear . She was also the narrator of Michelle Alexander's much acclaimed  The New Jim Crow.

The only clue to her identity is a series of tiny numbers etched into her dental implants. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a married man is arrested for the murder of his mistress. The police are adamant that he is her killer. However, forensic evidence tells a different story altogether. The Bali bombing investigation was essentially a giant murder case: one with 202 victims and three crime scenes. But outstanding investigative work by forensic scientists helped to identify the bombers and bring them to trial. This casebook of 16 fascinating true stories from Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Indonesia by award-winning Australian true crime writer Liz Porter shows how forensic science is used to catch killers, solve mysteries and exonerate falsely accused suspects. \u00a9 2018 by Liz Porter.

Written by someone who is at once both insider and outsider, the book is wonderfully funny and disarmingly honest portrait of Singapore and its people. \u00a9 2008 by Neil Humphreys.

The Best I Could traces the life and career of an advocate whose tireless devotion to the Singapore criminal justice system is legendary. In this highly personal autobiography, first published in 2009, Subhas describes not only the many sensational cases he covered, including those of Took Leng How, Anthony Ler and Ah Long San, but also his views on mandatory death sentences and 'police entrapment'. But why did he choose to represent clients who were to all intents and purposes guilty? And were the criminals he represented the monsters they were made out to be? Did he ever feel sorry for the clients he represented? What were his views on the death penalty, and which parts of the legal system did he want reformed? Read all about this in The Best I Could. The first edition spent 16 weeks on the National Bestsellers List and over 20,000 copies were sold. This new edition includes excerpts from the late author's forthcoming book It's Easy To Cry. \u00a9 2015 by Subhas Anandan.

                "After decades of overwhelming political domination by the People's Action Party (PAP), Singapore has entered a phase of political transition. It started with the loss of a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) in the 2011 general election (GE2011). After a huge rebound in the fortunes of the PAP in the 2015 general election following the death of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the transition resumed in the 2020 general election with the loss of yet another GRC. This book looks at the Workers' Party, Singapore's leading opposition party, through the eyes of Yee Jenn Jong, former Non-constituency Member of Parliament and Central Executive Committee member of the party. Jenn Jong took an unexpected leap into opposition politics just weeks before GE2011 and came out with a narrow loss of just one percent of the popular votes. In this book, he recounts his three contests in the general elections from 2011\u20132020, parliamentary work, and other activities in opposition politics. This book hopes to let readers better understand the nature of the work by opposition politicians in Singapore, which has been dominated by the PAP's narrative since 1959. The author also shares his thoughts on the shape of Singapore's politics going forward. \u00a9 2021 by Yee Jenn Jong.

Above all, they are Singapore media stories as experienced first-hand by a veteran journalist who had to be persuaded to become Editor of a leading newspaper. PN Balji was an active participant in mainstream journalism, having spent nearly 40 years working in five newsrooms. He was part of a hardy generation of newspaper editors who wrestled with editorial issues and made tough decisions, sometimes against the will of Lee Kuan Yew. He also had a ringside view of his colleagues' tussles and confrontations with the government. In Reluctant Editor, Balji weaves a compelling narrative, with anecdotes, of an alternative story of how some editors of his generation managed to hold the ground when Lee was at his rogue best. He brings back the drama, mostly played behind the scenes, and attempts to answer the question: What made the editors of the 1970s, 80s and 90s act the way they did? It was a life lived dangerously; some lost their jobs, some had to leave the country, and some decided to give in and lived to fight another day. \u00a9 2019 by PN Balji.

An opportunistic Texas congressman, Martin Dies, head of the newly formed House Un-American Activities Committee, successfully targets the Federal Theatre, exploiting rising tensions over communism and creating a new political playbook based on sensationalism, misinformation and fear - a playbook that has proved instrumental in our current culture wars. From one of the world's great storytellers, The Playbook is an invigorating re-enactment of a terrifyingly prescient moment in twentieth-century American cultural history. "

Golding packs humor, curiosity, honesty, anger, and ultimately acceptance in 12 essays spanning her life in Queens, NY, as a first-generation Jamaican American. She breaks down the 10 levels of Black Girl Math, from the hard glare to responses reserved for unfaithful boyfriends. She comes to terms with and heals from fraught relationships with her father, friends, and romantic partners. She takes the devastating news that she\u2019s a Black girl with a \u201cflat ass\u201d in stride, and adds squats to her routine, eventually.

Or was it a carefully regulated culture in which the uncontrollable excess of laughter was a force to fear-a world of wit, irony, and knowing smiles? How did Romans make sense of laughter? What role did it play in the world of the law courts, the imperial palace, or the spectacles of the arena? Laughter in Ancient Rome explores one of the most intriguing, but also trickiest, of historical subjects. Drawing on a wide range of Roman writing-from essays on rhetoric to a surviving Roman joke book-Mary Beard tracks down the giggles, smirks, and guffaws of the ancient Romans themselves. From ancient \"monkey business\" to the role of a chuckle in a culture of tyranny, she explores Roman humor from the hilarious, to the momentous, to the surprising. But she also reflects on even bigger historical questions. What kind of history of laughter can we possibly tell? Can we ever really \"get\" the Romans' jokes?. "

                "\"Ecstasy, witchcraft, bewilderment\u2014these ten loving vignettes on scandalous corners of Russian culture, by one of our most seasoned cultural critics, are a tribute to imperishable art even in our catastrophic time.\" (Caryl Emerson, professor emerita of Slavic languages and literatures, Princeton University)  In terms of literature, music, and film, it would be hard to outdo the sheer genius and creativity of Russia. These things constitute the soul of the nation, and it is this that Morris Berman explores in his latest work,  The Soul of Russia . His central argument is that at the heart of this brilliance lies a particular idiosyncratic theme: the peasant-shamanic-folkloric tradition of the Russian people, which these artists, from Pushkin to Tarkovsky, drew upon for their inspiration. It was a \"Dionysian\" source, a nonrational one, and it endowed Russian creative work with what we would have to call vibrancy.  Berman presents 10 Russian artists who have left their indelible imprint on our collective consciousness. Pushkin offers a supernatural puzzle that Russian scholars are still trying to solve to this day. Gogol tells a tale of a man who wakes up to discover he has lost his nose, and goes in search of it\u2014while his nose has simultaneously taken on a life of its own. Andrei Bely, in Petersburg, explains the revolution of 1905 not through traditional sociological or historical analysis, but by means of a surreal panorama of Oedipal events. Chekhov wittily explores the erotic properties of food, while Diaghilev shocks Europe with the great Vaslav Nijinsky and the Ballets Russes. Composing for this radical dance company, Stravinsky manages to alter the face of music forever. Mikhail Bulgakov offers one of the greatest novels of the 20th century,  The Master and Margarita , and Tarkovsky responds to Stanley Kubrick's famous  2001: A Space Odyssey  by coming up with  Solaris , a film based not on superficial American techno-fetishism but on questions of love, reality, and human identity.   The Soul of Russia  is a feast for the mind, but also for the senses\u2014a book that listeners will want to delve into more than once. Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont.   \u00a92023 Morris Berman \u00a7. "

                "A brilliant debut memoir about a young writer\u2014struggling with depression, family issues, and addiction\u2014and his life-changing decade working for Joan Didion   As an aspiring novelist in his early twenties, Cory Leadbeater was presented with an opportunity to work for a well-known writer whose identity was kept confidential. Since the tumultuous days of childhood, Cory had sought refuge from the rougher parts of life in the pages of books. Suddenly, he found himself the personal assistant to a titan of literature: Joan Didion.  In the nine years that followed, Cory shared Joan's rarefied world, transformed not only by her blazing intellect but by her generous friendship and mentorship. Together they recited poetry in the mornings, dined with Supreme Court justices, attended art openings, smoked a single cigarette before bed.  But secretly, Cory was spiraling. He reeled from the death of a close friend. He spent his weekends at a federal prison, visiting his father as he served time for fraud. He struggled day after day to write the novel that would validate him as a real writer. And meanwhile, the forces of addiction and depression loomed large.  In hypnotic prose that pulses with life and longing, The Uptown Local explores the fault lines of class, family, loss, and creativity. It is a love letter to a cultural icon\u2014and a moving testament to the relationships that sustain us in the eternal pursuit of a life worth living. "

                "A powerful exploration of the human capacity for renewal, as seen through Shakespeare and Freud In this fresh investigation, Stephen Greenblatt and Adam Phillips explore how the second chance has been an essential feature of the literary imagination and a promise so central to our existence that we try to reproduce it again and again. Innumerable stories, from the Homeric epics to the New Testament, and from Oedipus Rex to Hamlet, explore the realization or failure of second chances\u2014outcomes that depend on accident, acts of will, or fate. Such stories let us repeatedly rehearse the experience of loss and recovery: to know the joy that comes with a renewal of love and pleasure and to face the pain that comes with realizing that some damage can never be undone. Through a series of illuminating readings, the authors show how Shakespeare was the supreme virtuoso of the second chance and Freud was its supreme interpreter. Both Shakespeare and Freud believed that we can narrate our life stories as tales of transformation, of momentous shifts, constrained by time and place but often still possible. Ranging from The Comedy of Errors to The Winter's Tale, and from D. W. Winnicott to Marcel Proust, the authors challenge readers to imagine how, as Phillips writes, \"it is the mending that matters.\"\"In this scintillating collaboration between our leading Shakespearean and our most trenchant interpreter of Freud, the concept of the second chance keeps gathering momentum and reach. Second Chances is intellectually nimble and emotionally wise.\"\u2014Christopher Benfey, author of A Summer of Hummingbirds. "
