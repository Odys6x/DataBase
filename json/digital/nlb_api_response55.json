                "\"This book examines three big ideas: difference, legitimacy, and pluralism. Of chief concern is how people construe and deal with variation among fellow human beings. Why under certain circumstances do people embrace even sanctify differences, or at least begrudgingly tolerate them, and why in other contexts are people less receptive to difference, sometimes overtly hostile to it and bent on its eradication? What are the cultural and political conditions conducive to the positive valorization and acceptance of difference? And, conversely, what conditions undermine or erode such positive views and acceptance? This book examines pluralism in gendered fields and domains in Southeast Asia since the early modern era, which historians and anthropologists of the region commonly define as the period extending roughly from the 15th to the 18th centuries\"--Provided by publisher.

                "Peacekeeping operations have unintended consequences -- this has long been ignored by both practitioners and researchers. The deployment of a large number of soldiers, police officers and civilian personnel inevitably has various effects on the host society and economy, not all of which are in keeping with the peacekeeping mandate and intent or are easily discernible prior to the intervention. Such unintended consequences are especially serious when they cause harm to the local community, as in the case of sexual abuse and exploitation, corruption or the creation of a false economy. Unintended side-effects can also negatively affect the ability of the peacekeeping mission to achieve its mandate. This book is an attempt to improve understanding of unintended consequences of peacekeeping operations, by bringing together field experiences and academic analysis. It covers consequences on individuals and groups of individuals, on the host society and economy, and on the troop-contributing countries. It also analyzes the degree to which the United Nations has tried to manage some of these side effects, as well as the United Nations' accountability in the context of the international legal framework. The aim of the book is not to discredit peace operations but rather to improve the way in which such operations are planned and managed. The book identifies the need to develop a culture of accountability, which should include institutionalizing processes aimed at anticipating unintended consequences as a routine part of all planning cycles, and the monitoring of effects, including unintended effects, so that proactive steps can be taken to prevent and manage negative side effects as early as possible.--Publisher's description.

Three thousand miles later, they \"occupied\" the prime minister's front lawn in Ottawa, led a rally of 500 women on Parliament Hill, chained themselves to their chairs in the visitors' galleries, and shut down the House of Commons, the first and only time this had ever happened. The seventeen were a motley crew. They argued, they were loud, and they wouldn't take no for an answer. They pulled off a national campaign in an era when there was no social media, and with a budget that didn't stretch to long-distance phone calls. It changed their lives. And at a time when thousands of women in Canada were dying from back street abortions, it pulled women together across the country. "

                "Dead Woman Pickney  chronicles Yvonne Shorter Brown's life growing up in Jamaica between 1943 and 1965 and teaching in Canada from 1969. Told with stridency and humour, the stories include both personal experience and history.    Taking up the haunting memories of childhood, along with persistent racial marginalization of Black people, both globally and in Canada, the author sets out to construct a narrative that at once explains her own origins in the former slave society of Jamaica and traces the outsider status of Africa and its peoples. The author's quest to understand the absence of her mother and her mother's people from her life is at the heart of the narrative. The author struggles through life to discover the identity of her mother in the face of silence from her father's brutal family. In this updated edition she adds a coda, \"finding mother\", constructed from archives, genealogy, letters, and journals.   Initially published in 2010, this second edition includes expanded text and a foreword by Sonja Boon, author of  What the Oceans Remember. "

This maddening period of transformation and personal crisis is recognisable by the myriad of decisions we make - about partners, holidays, jobs, homes, savings, friendships - all of which are impacted by the urgency of the single decision that comes with a biological deadline, the one decision that is impossible to take back; whether or not to have a baby.  But how to stay sane in such a maddening time? How to know who you are and what you might want from life? How to know if you're making the right decisions?  Raw, hilarious and beguilingly honest, Nell Frizzell's account of her panic years is both an arm around the shoulder and a campaign to start a conversation. This affects us all - women, men, mothers, children, partners, friends, colleagues - so it's time we started talking about it with a little more candour.

Man-Made  aims to open readers' eyes to a transformative technological shift in society and give them the tools to make positive change.   'Mum, I want a robot slave.'  Broadcaster Tracey Spicer had an epiphany when her young son uttered these six words. Suddenly, her life's work fighting inequality seemed futile. What's the point in agitating to change the present, if bigotry is being embedded into our futures?  And so began a quest to uncover who was responsible and hold them to account. Who is the ultimate villain? Big Tech, whose titans refuse to spend money to fix the problem? The world's politicians, who lack the will to legislate? Or should we all be walking into a hall of mirrors and taking a good, hard look at ourselves...?  This is a deeply researched, illuminating and gripping ride into an uncertain future, culminating in a resounding call to action that will shake the tech sector to its foundations.  Praise for  Man-Made    'Exhilarating ... The book we need as we grapple with how AI will change our lives and our world.'  Dame Quentin Bryce   'Brilliant, hilarious and terrifying.

                "When Sophia Dorothea of Celle married her first cousin, the future King George I, she was an unhappy bride. Filled with dreams of romance and privilege, she hated the groom she called \u201cpig snout\u201d and wept at news of her engagement. In the austere court of Hanover, the vibrant young princess found herself ignored and unwanted. Bewildered by dusty protocol and regarded as a necessary evil by her husband, Sophia Dorothea grew lonely as he gallivanted with his mistress under her nose. When Sophia Dorothea plunged headlong into a passionate and dangerous affair with Count Phillip Christoph von K\u00f6nigsmarck, the stage was set for disaster. This dashing soldier was as celebrated for his looks as his bravery, and when he and Sophia Dorothea fell in love, they were dicing with death. Watched by a scheming and manipulative countess who had ambitions of her own, it was only a matter of time before scandal gripped the House of Hanover and tore the marriage of the heir to the British throne and his unhappy wife apart. Divorced and disgraced, Sophia Dorothea was locked away in a gilded cage for 30 years, whilst her lover faced an even darker fate. "

                "A stunning four-color biography of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the bestselling tradition of  Notorious RBG  and  Pelosi  that explores her explosive rise and impact on the future of American culture and politics.  The candidate was young\u2014twenty-eight years old, a child of Puerto Rico, the Bronx, and Yorktown Heights. She was working as a waitress and bartender. She was completely unknown, and taking on a ten-term incumbent in a city famous for protecting its political institutions. \"Women like me aren't supposed to run for office,\" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a video launching her campaign, the camera following her as she hastily pulled her hair into a bun. But she did. And in perhaps the most stunning upset in recent memory, she won. At twenty-nine, she was sworn in as the youngest member of the 116th Congress and became the youngest woman to serve as a representative in United States history.   Before long, Ocasio-Cortez had earned her own shorthand title\u2014AOC\u2014and was one of the most talked-about public figures (loved and loathed) in the world. Her natural ability to connect with everyday people through the social media feeds grew her following into the multimillions. Every statement she made, every tweet and Instagram Live, went viral, and her term had barely begun before people were speculating that she could one day be president. The question seemed to be on everyone's mind: How did this woman come from nowhere to acquire such influence, and so fast?   Now, in  Take Up Space , that question is answered through a kaleidoscopic biography by the editors of  New York  magazine that features the riveting account of her rise by Lisa Miller, an essay by Rebecca Traister that explains why she is an unprecedented figure in American politics, and multiform explorations (reportage, comic, history, analysis, photography) of AOC's outsize impact on American culture and politics. Throughout, AOC is revealed in all her power and vulnerability, and understood in the context of the fast-changing America that made her possible\u2014and perhaps even inevitable. "

The Authority Gap  provides a startling perspective on the unseen bias at work in our everyday lives, to reveal the scale of the gap that still persists between men and women. Would you believe that US Supreme Court Justices are interrupted four times more often than male ones... 96% of the time by men?

This powerful essay collection is a natural extension of the #MeToo movement, revealing the interior experience of women after they've inevitably been underestimated or hurt\u2014the epiphany that the world is different than they thought it to be\u2014and how they've used this knowledge to make change.   In  My Moment , Gloria Steinem tells the story of how a meeting with writer Terry Southern drew blood. Carol Burnett shares how CBS discouraged her from pursuing  The Carol Burnett Show , because comedy variety shows were \"a man's game.\" Joanna Gaines reveals how coming to New York City as a young woman helped her embrace her Korean heritage after enduring racist bullying as a child. Author Maggie Smith details a career crossroads when her boss declined her request to work from home after the birth of her daughter, leading her to quit and never look back.   Over and over again, when told \"no\" these women said \"yes\" to themselves. This hugely inspiring, beautiful book will move people of all ages and make them feel less alone. More than the sum of its parts,  My Moment  is also a handbook for young women (or any woman) making their way through the world. "

                "\"Argetsinger...is a true pageant enthusiast; she brings empathy and respect to the women who have followed this path.\" \u2014 The Washington Post      A  Washington Post  Style editor's fascinating and irresistible look back on the Miss America pageant as it approaches its 100th anniversary.   The sash. The tears. The glittering crown. And of course, that soaring song. For all of its pomp and kitsch, the Miss America pageant is indelibly written into the American story of the past century. From its giddy origins as a summer's-end tourist draw in Prohibition-era Atlantic City, it blossomed into a televised extravaganza that drew tens of millions of viewers in its heyday and was once considered the highest honor that a young woman could achieve.   For two years,  Washington Post  reporter and editor Amy Argetsinger visited pageants and interviewed former winners and contestants to unveil the hidden world of this iconic institution.  There She Was  spotlights how the pageant survived decades of social and cultural change, collided with a women's liberation movement that sought to abolish it, and redefined itself alongside evolving ideas about feminism.   For its superstars\u2014Phyllis George, Vanessa Williams, Gretchen Carlson\u2014and for those who never became household names, Miss America was a platform for women to exercise their ambitions and learn brutal lessons about the culture of fame. Spirited and revelatory,  There She Was  charts the evolution of the American woman, from the Miss America catapulted into advocacy after she was exposed as a survivor of domestic violence to the one who used her crown to launch a congressional campaign; from a 1930s winner who ran away on the night of her crowning to a present-day rock guitarist carving out her place in this world. Argetsinger dissects the scandals and financial turmoil that have repeatedly threatened to kill the pageant\u2014and highlights the unexpected sisterhood of Miss Americas fighting to keep it alive. "

                "A new kind of manifesto for the working woman, with practical guidance on building wealth as well as inspiration for harnessing the freedom and power that comes from a breadwinning mindset.  Women are now the main breadwinner in one-in-four households in the UK. Yet the majority of women still aren't being brought up to  think  like breadwinners. In fact, they're actively discouraged \u2013 by institutional bias and subconscious beliefs \u2013 from building their own wealth, pursuing their full earning potential, and providing for themselves and others financially. The result is that women earn less, owe more, and have significantly less money saved and invested for the future than men do. And if women do end up as the main breadwinner, they've been conditioned to feel reluctant and unprepared to manage the role. In  Think Like a Breadwinner , financial expert Jennifer Barrett reframes what it really means to be a breadwinner by dismantling the narrative that women don't \u2013 and shouldn't \u2013 take full financial responsibility to create the lives they want. Featuring a wide variety of case studies from women at all stages of their careers and financial lives, Barrett shares the secrets of women who already think like breadwinners. Barrett reveals not only the importance of women building their own wealth, but also the freedom and power that comes with it. "

                "When impoverished aristocrat Lady Charlotte Bertie married wealthy Welsh ironmaster John Guest of Dowlais in 1833, her relatives looked on with dismay. Yet despite their vast difference of background and age, over their nineteen-year long marriage, husband and wife enjoyed great happiness and much adventure. There would be ten children and while John built up an immense commercial empire, Charlotte championed Welsh culture. Crucially, she taught herself John's business from the inside. Over the years, she made the keenest observation of iron production, the fluctuations of the trade and the engineering innovations that touched upon its developments. When John died in 1852, she was therefore uniquely well-placed to succeed him as head of the works - a remarkable position for a Victorian woman. Not only did she endeavor to introduce reforms, but also - rather to her dismay - had to weather a potentially destructive strike. But success came at a price. With her star to all sight in the ascendant, Lady Charlotte suddenly chose to abandon all, leave Wales and marry her sons' tutor. This book traces the ardent, creative years of her first marriage, explores her determination - widowed - to preserve John's legacy, and observes her growing devotion to the scholarly Charles Schreiber.

                "'Brilliant' Jenni Murray 'Liberating, intoxicating' Zoe Williams 'Why, after decades of social progress, is motherhood still so much harder than it needs to be?' Before they become mothers, women are repeatedly reminded that their biological clock is ticking. Once pregnant, a woman's body becomes public property: she is patronised, panicked, and forbidden from exercising her autonomy. In labour, women's wishes are overridden, resulting in potentially life-changing injuries and trauma. When the baby comes home, women begin a life of pay cuts, lost job opportunities, heavier housework, unequal emotional loads, and judgement from all sides. State support and family networks have fallen away, and mothers are censured for every 'choice' they make \u2013 if they are given real choices at all. In this searing and vital book, Eliane Glaser asks why mothers are idealised, yet treated so poorly; why campaigns for mothers have become so unfashionable; and what we need to do to shift the needle and improve the business of child-rearing for everyone.

The country is gripped by suffragette fever. These impassioned crusaders have their admirers; some agree with their aims if not their forceful methods, while others are aghast at the thought of giving  any  female a vote.  Meanwhile, hundreds of women are stepping out on to the streets of Britain. They are the suffragists: non-militant campaigners for the vote, on an astonishing six-week protest march they call the Great Pilgrimage. Rich and poor, young and old, they defy convention, risking jobs, family relationships and even their lives to persuade the country to listen to them.    Fresh and original, full of vivid detail and moments of high drama,  Hearts and Minds  is both funny and incredibly moving, important and wonderfully entertaining. "

                "It is a myth that either of the World Wars liberated women.  The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919 was one of the most significant pieces of legislation in modern Britain. It marked at once political watershed and a social revolution; the point at which women of 21 and over were recognised in law as being as competent as men. But were they? What actually happened when this bill was passed? This is the story of what happened next.  Ladies Can't Climb Ladders  focuses on the lives of six women - six pioneers - forging paths in the fields of medicine, law, academia, architecture, engineering and the church. Robinson's startling study into the public and private lives of these women sheds light not on the desires and ambitions of her subjects but how family and society responded to the working woman and what their legacy looks like today.  This book is written in their honour. It is a book about live subjects: equal opportunity, the gender pay gap, and whether women can expect, or indeed deserve, to have it at all.

                "Blazing her trail at the dawn of the twentieth century, Vida Goldstein remains Australia's most celebrated crusader for the rights of women. Her life \u2013 as a campaigner for the suffrage in Australia, Britain and America, an advocate for peace, a fighter for social equality and a shrewd political commentator \u2013 marks her as one of Australia's foremost women of courage and principle.  Vida first came to national prominence as the first woman in the Western world to stand for a national Parliament, in Victoria, for the Senate, in 1903. As a fighter for equal rights for women, and as a champion of social justice, she quickly established a pattern of working quietly against men's control of Australian society. Her work for the peace movement and against conscription during the heightened emotions of the First World War showed her determination to defy governments in the name of fairness and equity.  Vida came to adulthood when Australia was in the process of inventing itself as a new nation, one in which women might have opportunities equal to those of men. Her work for her own sex, especially her battles for equality in politics, illuminated issues that persist to this day.  Jacqueline Kent has written acclaimed biographies of Julia Gillard, pianist and social activist Hephzibah Menuhin, and pioneer book editor Beatrice Davis. "

                "The history of women in medieval Wales before the English conquest of 1282 is one largely shrouded in mystery. For the Age of Princes, an era defined by ever-increased threats of foreign hegemony, internal dynastic strife and constant warfare, the comings and goings of women are little noted in sources. This misfortune touches even the most well-known royal woman of the time, Joan of England (d. 1237), the wife of Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd, illegitimate daughter of King John and half-sister to Henry III. With evidence of her hand in thwarting a full scale English invasion of Wales to a notorious scandal that ended with the public execution of her supposed lover by her husband and her own imprisonment, Joan\u2019s is a known, but little-told or understood story defined by family turmoil, divided loyalties and political intrigue. From the time her hand was promised in marriage as the result of the first Welsh-English alliance in 1201 to the end of her life, Joan\u2019s place in the political wranglings between England and the Welsh kingdom of Gwynedd was a fundamental one. As the first woman to be designated Lady of Wales, her role as one a political diplomat in early thirteenth-century Anglo-Welsh relations was instrumental. This first-ever account of Siwan, as she was known to the Welsh, interweaves the details of her life and relationships with a gendered re-assessment of Anglo-Welsh politics by highlighting her involvement in affairs, discussing events in which she may well have been involved but have gone unrecorded and her overall deployment of royal female agency.

                "As the fight for women\u2019s rights continues, and whilst men and women alike push for gender equality around the globe, this book aims to introduce readers to four women who, in their own way, challenged and defied the societal expectations of the time in which they lived. Some chose to be writers, some were successful business women, some chose to nurture and protect, some traveled the globe, some were philanthropists. Each one made the conscious decision not to marry a man. Elizabeth Isham of Lamport Hall,\u00a0Ann Robinson of Saltram,\u00a0Anne Lister of Shibden Hall and\u00a0Rosalie Chichester of Arlington Court.\u00a0These are elite women, all connected to country houses or from noble families throughout the UK, and this book explores to what extent privilege gave them the opportunity to choose the life they wanted, thus guiding the reader to challenge their own beliefs about elite women throughout history. This book is unique in that it brings the stories of real historical women to light \u2013 some of which have never been written about before, whilst also offering an introduction to the history of marriage and societal expectations of women. Starting in 1609 and traveling chronologically up to 1949, with a chapter for each woman, this book tells their remarkable stories, revealing how strong, resilient and powerful women have always been.

They were Charlotte, Augusta, Elizabeth, Mary, Sophia, and Amelia, the daughters of King George III and Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Though more than fifteen years divided the births of the eldest sister from the youngest, these princesses all shared a longing for escape. Faced with their father\u2019s illness and their mother\u2019s dominance, for all but one a life away from the seclusion of the royal household seemed like an unobtainable dream. The six daughters of George III were raised to be young ladies and each in her time was one of the most eligible women in the world. Tutored in the arts of royal womanhood, they were trained from infancy in the skills vial to a regal wife but as the king\u2019s illness ravaged him, husbands and opportunities slipped away. Yet even in isolation, the lives of the princesses were filled with incident. From secret romances to dashing equerries, rumors of pregnancy, clandestine marriage and even a run-in with Napoleon, each princess was the leading lady in her own story, whether tragic or inspirational. In The Royal Nunnery: Daughters of George III, take a wander through the hallways of the royal palaces, where the king\u2019s endless ravings echo deep into the night and his daughters strive to be recognized not just as princesses, but as women too.

                "She was the daughter of an alcoholic Isle of Wight smuggler. Much of her childhood was spent in the island\u2019s workhouse. Yet Sophie Dawes threw off the shackles of her downbeat formative years to become one of the most talked-about personalities in post-revolutionary France. It was the ultimate rags to riches story which would see her become the mistress of the fabulously wealthy French aristocrat Louis Henri de Bourbon, destined to be the last Prince of Cond\u00e9. Her total subjugation of the ageing prince, her obsessive desire for a position among the highest echelon of French royalist society following the Bourbon restoration, and her designs upon a hefty chunk of Louis Henri\u2019s vast fortune would lead to scandal, sensation and then infamy. The Infamous Sophie Dawes takes an in-depth look at her island background before tracing her extraordinary rise from obscurity to becoming a baroness who ruled the prince\u2019s ch\u00e2teau at Chantilly as its unofficial queen and intrigued with the King of the French to get what she wanted. But how far did she go? The book examines the mysterious death of Louis Henri in 1830 and uses newly discovered evidence in a bid to determine the part Sophie may have played in his demise. "

Their story played out on the European stage during a period of political upheaval and new political ideas. Napoleon gained power in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and he would go from spectacular victories to dismal failure. His defeat in the early nineteenth century would result in Europe acquiring new national borders and with that Britain, Russia, and the United States would gain greater international influence. Juliette, on the other hand, wielded her own power. Because of the tumultuous French Revolution, noble and aristocratic landowners were being replaced by a new wealthy class in the private sector. Juliette and her husband were among the beneficiaries of this growing affluence and influence, and her power came from her new-found position in society. Juliette also viewed life differently than Napoleon. She saw life from the standpoint of a wealthy socialite whereas Napoleon\u2019s desires were always shaded by his military experiences and his meteoric rise to power.\u00a0 Along the way, Juliette would have to face the testy Emperor, and she would find that his own brother would fall for her. Even some of Napoleon\u2019s greatest enemies would woo her. "

She had a difficult childhood and a turbulent adolescence, but she was popular with the public, who looked to her to restore the good name of the monarchy. When she broke off her engagement to a Dutch prince, her father put her under virtual imprisonment and she endured a period of profound unhappiness. But she held out for the freedom to choose her husband, and when she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg she finally achieved contentment. Her happiness was cruelly cut short when she died in childbirth at the age of twenty-one only eighteen months later. A shocked nation went into mourning for its \u2018people\u2019s princess\u2019, the queen who never was. "

Our bodies, and everything they do, make us who we are' -  Amika George, founder of Free Periods Campaign  ______________________    What do you do when you're homeless and on your period? What does it feel like to have a poo following childbirth? How do we learn to love our bodies again after they've been abused?    It's rude. It's improper. It's disgusting. All justifications that leave women's questions about their bodies unanswered. And activist Nimko Ali has had enough of it.  Following her own experience of FGM and rebuilding her relationship with her body, this important book contains the true stories of women sharing what they've always been told is secret and shameful - from east London to Ethiopia, from pregnancy to menopause.    This is a call to arms. This is a cry to reclaim the narrative around our fannies and to refuse the taboos that silent us.    ______________________    'A beautiful book with such a wide range of uplifting but often heart-breaking stories. Made us cry and think in equal measure'  - Pandora Sykes, co-host of  The High Low    'Nimko has blown apart all taboos, blown apart the echo chamber and included  all  women in the feminist conversation.'  - Scarlett Curtis, author of  Feminists Don't Wear Pink    'There is no subject too taboo for her to tackle. We should all be talking about our vaginas and she is leading the way' -  Bryony Gordon, author of  Mad Girl   ' Nimko Ali is heroine for our time, she destroys the notion of things being too rude to discuss'  - Caitlin Moran, author of  How to Be a Woman.

Beatrix Potter's famous little white books have enchanted generations of young readers who adored the characters she created and of course her own distinctive illustrations. Born into a typically repressed Victorian family it was assumed that Beatrix would achieve little more than finding herself a rich husband, and so there was no point in bothering to educate her. But the Potters underestimated their daughter. Stifled by the lack of stimulation, she educated herself in art, science, and of course a great love of the natural world. The success of Peter Rabbit proved her to be creative genius who could have become the toast of the London literary scene, but when her fianc\u00e9 tragically died Beatrix retreated to the Lake District where she reinvented herself as a successful farmer, a canny businesswoman and an early environmental pioneer. Passionately campaigning to save the area from development she helped establish the National Trust, and despite her great wealth Beatrix lived out her days in humble anonymity. "

Invisible Women  reveals how in a world built for and by men we are systematically ignoring half of the population, often with disastrous consequences.

                "'For me these Ormond College women were, and are, the first voices of the revolution that is #MeToo in Australia.'       Twenty-five years ago, Australia was in the grip of another debate about sex and power.    The Master of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne had been acquitted of indecent assault after complaints by two female students. Helen Garner's bestselling book about the case,  The First Stone , polarised readers over whether the students had been right to take their allegations to the law. Was the feminist movement poisoning gender relations?    In  Generation F , the young award-winning journalist Virginia Trioli offered a vigorous, incisive and compelling argument for the ongoing need for feminism, while exploring her own bewilderment and anger. She described the real state of sexual harassment, violence, the workplace and the law in Australia: how most women just copped it, but those who felt able to confront it needed all the support they could get.    Now \u2013 as women around the world speak up about how sexual harassment has destroyed their work, families and lives \u2013 Trioli revisits that cultural moment in a new foreword, and in a new afterword considers the situation women face today.    Dismayingly, her original text is just as relevant, and her call to action just as powerful. "

Why are we still so ignorant about such a fundamental bodily process?\u00a0Now, in\u00a0Period., Emma draws on female experiences that will make you laugh, weep (and, most probably, squirm), in a fierce and funny rallying cry to smash this ridiculous taboo once and for all.\u00a0Because it's about bloody time.

And, for the first time, she writes about her personal life and the road to equality in her own marriage. Throughout, she shows how there has never been more opportunity to change the world \u2013 and ourselves.Writing with emotion, candour, and grace, she introduces us to remarkable women and shows the power of connecting with one another.When we lift others up, they lift us up, too.

It's an exciting, liberating moment time of female empowerment\u2014but now we have to relearn how to connect with each other. Instead of supporting each other through the challenges of a traditionally male-dominated working world, millions of women have experienced the polar opposite. Studies show that 30% of workplace bullies are female\u2014employing tactics such as cyber bullying, verbal attacks, gossiping, and shunning to use against each other\u2014and many women have garnered \"mean girl\" reputations as competitive and unsupportive in the workplace. Inside the galvanizing In This Together, 40 successful and eminent women from a wide range of fields show us how much we can achieve if we embrace our collective power and strength, instead of competing against each other\u2014such as learning new skills to advance in our careers and ultimately earn more money, working to dramatically increase the number of women in leadership positions, and even recruiting men to take up workplace equality as their own impassioned cause. Empowering, stirring, and actionable, In This Together is an indispensable addition to every modern woman's arsenal in our continued fight for the opportunities we deserve. "

                "Courage Calls to Courage Everywhere is a timely and inspiring call to arms by one of Britain's most acclaimed and important writers. Whilst recognising how far women have come in the hundred years since getting the vote, Jeanette Winterson also insists that we must all do much more if we are to achieve true gender equality. Examining recent women's rights movements, the worlds of politics, technology and social media and changes in the law, Winterson calls out all the ways in which women still face discrimination and disadvantage. Like the women who won the right to vote, we need to shout up, reach out, be courageous and finish the job. Also included in this volume is Emmeline Pankhurst's landmark Suffragette speech, 'Freedom or Death', which she delivered in 1913. "

Jane Austen lived only just into her forties, never married, never had children, lived all her life in the south of England and rarely strayed far from the genteel and orthodox social circle into which she was born. She completed only six novels, and achieved little fame in her lifetime. Yet 200 years after her death, she remains one of our most revered writers, and one of the most regularly adapted for television and film. Her novels are beloved by readers all over the world who continue to be inspired, beguiled and delighted by her often comic, and always shrewd insights into the calculations, and complexities of human hearts and minds. This short and astute biography gets to the quick of the enigmatic woman who was Jane Austen, and to the enduring qualities in her work which make it so universally loved and admired. "

                "How do we understand glamour? Has it empowered women or turned them into objects? Once associated with modernity and the cutting edge, is it entirely bound up with nostalgia and tradition? This unique and fascinating book tells the story of glamour. It explores the changing meanings of the word, its relationship to femininity and fashion, and its place in twentieth century social history. Using a rich variety of sources - from women's magazines and film to social surveys and life histories - Carol Dyhouse examines with wit and insight the history and meaning of costume, cosmetics, perfume and fur. Dyhouse disentangles some of the arguments surrounding femininity, appearance and power, directly addressing feminist concerns. The book explores historical contexts in which glamour served as an expression of desire in women and an assertion of entitlement to the pleasures of affluence, finally arguing that glamour can't simply be dismissed as oppressive, or as male fantasy, but can carry celebratory meanings for women.

                "In 1998, Sarbjit Athwal was called by her husband to attend a family meeting. It looked like just another family gathering. An attractive house in west London, a large dining room, two brothers, their mother, one wife. But the subject they were discussing was anything but ordinary. At the head of the group sat the elderly mother. She stared proudly around, smiling at her children, then raised her hand for silence. 'It's decided then,' the old lady announced. 'We have to get rid of her.'  'Her' was Surjit Athwal, Sarbjit's sister-in-law. Within three weeks of that meeting, Surjit was dead: lured from London to India, drugged, strangled, and her body dumped in the Ravi River, never to be seen again.  After the killing, risking her own life, Sarbjit fought secretly for justice for nine long, scared years. Eventually, with immense bravery, she became the first person within a murderer's family ever to go into open court in an honour killing trial as the Prosecution's key witness, and the first to waive her anonymity in such a trial. As a result of her testimony, the trial led to the first successful prosecution of an honour killing without the body ever being found.  But her story doesn't end there. Since the trial, her life has been threatened; her own husband arrested after an allegation of intimidation. Shamed is a story of fear and of horror - but also of immense courage, and a woman who risked everything to see that justice was done. "

She is the constitutional monarch of sixteen sovereign states, head of the fifty-three member Commonwealth of Nations, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and head of the armed forces. Most notably, however, on 9 September 2015 she became the longest reigning monary in British history - a rule that has witnessed the terms of twelve prime ministers and seven popes. She has consistently adapted in order to remain relevant, while devotedly upholding the age-old traditions of the monarchy. Although there have only been six British female monarchs, it can be argued that some of the most enlightened times in history have occurred during periods of queenship. Elizabeth I led the country through the Golden Age and Victoria ushered in the Industrial Revolution, but it is Elizabeth II who will leave the most illustrious and progressive legacy of all. "

Today's, films are not seen only for entertainment but they have a great impact on the thinking of human and also make them capable to understand and handle these situations. Further, films can also focus and maintain philosophical reflection on important aspects of human experience and the ethical theory that is meant to inform it. Similarly, this book teaches us about the ethics of care. The book titled as \"Feminist ethics in film: Reconfiguring care through cinema, which examines the ways in which popular film, rather than art house or foreign cinema, conveys and configures a particular philosophical view the ethics of care. In film, the feminist ethics covers the quasi-biographies on offer at the cinema and also explains how these stories and relationships expand our theoretical grasp of care based ethics that have been overlooked in less contextualized discussions. In addition, this book also examines the relationships between care and community, autonomy, family and self-transformation. Examining films from the perspective of feminist, care-based ethics both expands our knowledge of the area of philosophy and adds depth to our appreciation of the films. Additionally, this book is written to be read as a whole, to encompass the widening scope that expands from the individual to family, friends, community, and finally reaching the level of the state.

We tend to see the Second World War as a man's war, featuring Spitfire crews and brave deeds on the Normandy beaches. But in conditions of \"Total War\" millions of women - in the Services and on the Home Front - demonstrated that they were cleverer, more broad-minded and altogether more complex than anyone had ever guessed. In  Millions Like Us  Virginia Nicholson tells the story of the women's war, through a host of individual women's experiences. She tells how they loved, suffered, laughed, grieved and dared; how they re-made their world in peacetime. And how they would never be the same again ... "

A pair of silk sensations costing thousands of pounds designed by Yantonnay of Paris, or heavy wooden clogs with metal cleats that spark on the cobbles of a factory yard? Will your shoes be heavy with mud from trudging along duckboards between the tents of a frontline hospital... or stuck with tufts of turf from a football pitch? Great War Fashion follows the revolution in women's lives and aspirations during the second decade of the 20th Century, as reflected in costume and appearance. We open the wardrobe in the years before the outbreak of war to explore the contrast between the stiff, mono-bosomed ideal of Edwardian womanhood and the gossamer gowns draped around her. While suffragettes battle social and legal restrictions, fashion literally hobbles women with narrow skirts and thigh-length corsets. "

This wonderfully warm, funny and candid book is a collection of hopeful dispatches from the frontline of girlhood - an impassioned plea to stop piling pressure on girls and young women and allow them to get on with their lives without having to mind the thigh gap . . .

Historically, women wanting to sail in their own right faced many challenges. They were rejected as nuisances and outsiders, trespassing into the male maritime tribe. Today they command cruise ships and are becoming commodores. This comprehensive work looks at both the merchant and royal navies, explaining women's progressions from outsider to 'master' - with male shipmates as obstacles and helping hands. Using interviews and sources never before published, Jo Stanley vividly reveals the incredible journey across time taken by women at sea. "

Hunted by her angry father and brothers, who were determined to make her an honour killing, she had to keep moving house to escape them. Then, worst of all, in her family's eyes, she became a Christian. Some Muslims say converting from Islam is punishable by death...One day a mob of forty men came after her, armed with hammers, sticks and knives...with her father at the front...  The Imam's Daughter is Hannah's gripping - but ultimately inspiring - true story. How, through her courage and determination, she broke free from her background and found a new life beyond its confines - a new life of freedom and love. "

                "A provocative and debate-inspiring book which explores the pressure, politics, philosophy and culture of motherhood in today's society. Motherhood has changed. For several decades there has been tension between traditional ideas and modern values of mothering. For years the trend was away from the constraints which bound down our own mothers and towards liberating women. But in the 1980s and 1990s the momentum has shifted into sharp reverse. Mother of All Myths documents the present backlash, examining responses in the media, the courts, the government, in medicine and through 'pop' psychology, which reasserts an old-fashioned, conservative and narrow view of what a mother should be and do. In addition, the author explores the strong, highly idealized concept of motherhood that exists in the West; finding reflections of that image in history, in Christianity, in literature and in mythology. So why is this backlash happening now and who is losing out? This powerful book provides a long-overdue debate on motherhood by pressing that society should not only rethink our concept of mothering and responsibility, but strip motherhood of the worst excesses of sentimentality thereby allowing the mother's needs to be more evenly balanced against those of the child.

                "'[A] vivid, inquiring memoir... A properly soul-searching book' - Tim Adams,  Observer   As one of our leading campaigners for justice, human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith has spent a lifetime getting to know his clients - from detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay to prisoners facing execution on Death Row - and finding out, in his own words, 'what makes them tick'. But for much of his life, closer to home, there was a man whose mind remained off limits: his own father. It was only years after Dick's death, when Clive inherited more than 3,000 of his letters, that he could finally take a breath and start to piece together the obsessive personality behind them. In  The Far Side of the Moon , Stafford Smith seeks the broad conversation about mental illness that was not accessible in his earlier years, reflecting on his father's fragmented life together with that of Larry Lonchar, a client who also struggled with severe depression, and whose fate continues to preoccupy him. Following the critically acclaimed  Injustice , this courageous new book is an indictment of the failures in our social and justice systems, a meditation on privilege and its consequences, and an intimate exploration of how the mind's hinterlands can impact a family and shape a life.

                "'A magisterial contribution to the understanding of the cultural position of Romani people in Europe. ... nothing short of astounding'  Literary Review   This remarkable book describes a dark side of European history: the rejection of the Roma from their initial arrival in the late Middle Ages to the present day. To Europeans, the Roma appeared to be in complete contradiction with their own culture, because of their mysterious origins, unknown language and way of life. As representatives of an oral culture, for centuries the Roma have left virtually no written records of their own. Their history has been conveyed to us almost exclusively through the distorted images that European cultures project. Persecuted and shunned, the Roma nonetheless spread out across the continent and became an important, indeed indispensable element in the European imagination. It is impossible to conceive of the culture of Spain, southern France and much of Central Europe without this pervasive Romani influence.  Europe and the Roma  brilliantly describes the 'fascination and fear' which have marked Europeans' response to the Romani presence. Countless composers, artists and writers have responded to Romani culture and to fantasies thereof. Their projections onto a group whose illiteracy and marginalization gave it so little direct voice of its own have always been a very uneasy mixture of the inspired, the patronizing and the frighteningly ignorant. The book also shows the link between cultural violence, social discrimination and racist policies that paved the way for the genocide of the Roma. "

The idea that family and country have the same structure in Confucianism attaches great importance to the order within the family/arrangement of gender power hierarchy, therefore the cultural design and conception of women has a set of complex and three-dimensional system itself.It is the various changes emerging when this \"women tradition\" experienced western culture shock in the late Qing Dynasty that resulted in a bizarre sex landscape at that time, and meanwhile also created a vast dialogue space on women image for Chinese and Western cultures.The men and women in late Qing constitute together a complex and interesting \"reconstruction\" story, in terms of how to participate in the change of this \"women tradition\", and based on which they conduct various practices in morality, life and culture.)

                "Journalist and author Mark Whitaker explores the momentous year that redefined the civil rights movement as a new sense of Black identity expressed in the slogan \"Black Power\" challenged the nonviolent philosophy of Martin Luther King, Jr. and John Lewis.   In gripping, novelistic detail,  Saying It Loud  tells the story of how the Black Power phenomenon began to challenge the traditional civil rights movement in the turbulent year of 1966.  Saying It Loud  takes you inside the dramatic events in this seminal year, from Stokely Carmichael's middle-of-the-night ouster of moderate icon John Lewis as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to Carmichael's impassioned cry of \"Black Power!\" during a protest march in rural Mississippi. From Julian Bond's humiliating and racist ouster from the Georgia state legislature because of his antiwar statements to Ronald Reagan's election as California governor riding a \"white backlash\" vote against Black Power and urban unrest. From the founding of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California, to the origins of Kwanzaa, the Black Arts Movement, and the first Black studies programs. From Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ill-fated campaign to take the civil rights movement north to Chicago to the wrenching ousting of the white members of SNCC.  Deeply researched and widely reported,  Saying It Loud  offers brilliant portraits of the major characters in the yearlong drama, and provides new details and insights from key players and journalists who covered the story. It also makes a compelling case for why the lessons from 1966 still resonate in the era of Black Lives Matter and the fierce contemporary battles over voting rights, identity politics, and the teaching of Black history.

                "Lady Hale is an inspirational figure admired for her historic achievements and for the causes she has championed.  Spider Woman  is her story.   As 'a little girl from a little school in a little village in North Yorkshire', she only went into the law because her headteacher told her she wasn't clever enough to study history. She became the most senior judge in the country but it was an unconventional path to the top.  How does a self-professed 'girly swot' get ahead in a profession dominated by men? Was it a surprise that the perspectives of women and other disadvantaged groups had been overlooked, or that children's interests were marginalised? A lifelong smasher of glass-ceilings, who took as her motto 'women are equal to everything', her landmark rulings in areas including domestic violence, divorce, mental health and equality were her attempt to correct that.  As President of the Supreme Court, Lady Hale won global attention in finding the 2019 prorogation of Parliament to be unlawful. Yet that dramatic moment was merely the pinnacle of a career throughout which she was hailed as a pioneering reformer.  Wise, warm and inspiring,  Spider Woman  shows how the law shapes our world and supports us in crisis. It is the story of how Lady Hale found that she could overcome the odds, which shows that anyone from similar beginnings will find that they can cope too. "

In this engaging and provocative new book, beloved actor, director, and social activist Justin Baldoni reflects on his own struggles with masculinity. With insight and honesty, he explores a range of difficult, sometimes uncomfortable topics including strength and vulnerability, relationships and marriage, body image, sex and sexuality, racial justice, gender equality, and fatherhood.   Writing from experience, Justin invites us to move beyond the scripts we've learned since childhood and the roles we are expected to play. He challenges men to be brave enough to be vulnerable, to be strong enough to be sensitive, to be confident enough to listen. Encouraging men to dig deep within themselves, Justin helps us reimagine what it means to be man enough and in the process what it means to be human. "

How do you prepare your children for it, but also fill them with all the boundlessness and eccentricity that they deserve and that life has to offer? In  Brown Baby , Nikesh Shukla, author of the bestselling  The Good Immigrant , explores themes of racism, feminism, parenting and our shifting ideas of home. This memoir, by turns heartwrenching, hilariously funny and intensely relatable, is dedicated to the author's two young daughters, and serves as an act of remembrance to the grandmother they never had a chance to meet. Through love, grief, food and fatherhood, Shukla shows how it's possible to believe in hope. "

Darren McGarvey has experienced poverty and its devastating effects first-hand. He knows why people from deprived communities all around Britain feel angry and unheard. And he wants to explain . . .   So he invites you to come on a safari of sorts. But not the kind where the wildlife is surveyed from a safe distance. This book takes you inside the experience of poverty to show how the pressures really feel and how hard their legacy is to overcome.   Arguing that both the political left and right misunderstand poverty as it is actually lived, McGarvey sets out what everybody \u2013 including himself \u2013 could do to change things. Razor-sharp, fearless and brutally honest,  Poverty Safari  is an unforgettable insight into modern Britain. "

So begins Emmanuel Acho in his essential guide to the truths Americans need to know to address the systemic racism that has recently electrified protests in all fifty states. 'There is a fix,' Acho says. 'But in order to access it, we're going to have to have some uncomfortable conversations.' In  Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man , Acho takes on all the questions, large and small, insensitive and taboo, many white people are afraid to ask \u2013 yet which everyone needs the answers to, now more than ever. With the same open-hearted generosity that has made his video series a phenomenon, Acho explains the vital core of such fraught concepts as white privilege, cultural appropriation, and \"reverse racism.\" In his own words, he provides a space of compassion and understanding in a discussion that can lack both. He asks only for the reader's curiosity\u2014but along the way, he will galvanize all of us to join the antiracist fight. "

A toe-curling moment, an embarrassing  faux-pas  or a bewildering social situation is always just round the corner.  Danny, for example, always says the wrong thing about a friend's baby; has his party gate-crashed by a minor celebrity; and even discovers the pleasures of wearing pyjamas (exciting isn't it!). He breaks  all  the rules; hides a pastry; accidentally spits on someone; tricks Su Pollard; and (we've all been there) avoids his old hairdresser. And then there are the times when he has an argument with a bishop; experiences stage fright in the men's room; gets his wife a treat; and (eventually) helps a lady who has accidentally got her skirt all hitched up.   As we follow a year in his life - and it becomes obvious to the attentive reader that here is a man who finds it a challenge to even look after himself properly - an even greater responsibility looms on the horizon...  Once you have read this book you will see Awkward Situations everywhere you go and life will never be the same again. And, it's very, very funny. "

The New Jim Crow  is such a book. Lawyer and activist Michelle Alexander offers a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status, denied the very rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights movement.   Challenging the notion that the election of Barack Obama signalled a new era of colourblindness in the United States,  The New Jim Crow  reveals how racial discrimination was not ended but merely redesigned. By targeting black men through the War on Drugs and decimating communities of colour, the American criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, relegating millions to a permanent second-class status even as it formally adheres to the principle of colourblindness.   A searing call to action for everyone concerned with social justice,  The New Jim Crow  is one of the most important books about race in the 21st century. "

                "We are all different in some ways, yet, very similar because we all respond to emotions of love, affection, joy and sorrow. These feelings are common to all-across ethnicities, geographies and boundaries. Yet there are certain factors which contribute to our identity, which visibly make us look dissimilar, and impacts how we connect and belong.  The colour of the skin, through its subtle and attached symbolism and beliefs, its presence or the lack of it, tells a story of human dynamics that is constructive and/or destructive, depending on the lens used. It has the visual power to influence, pronounce judgements, divide, confer privileges and even influence the right to love, hate, embrace, protect or kill merely based on colour-the colour of the skin.  Colour Matters?  explores these cross-cultural dynamics and highlights the difficulties of being a minority in different geographies. The book is replete with stories of individuals across continents and multi-ethnic, multi-professional backgrounds narrating their personal experiences and, hence, learnings from their own encounters.  In a world where the race and racism debate continues to occupy a crucial space in public discourse it is worthwhile to embark on an exploratory journey to deconstruct such ideas and discover what really lies beneath.

                "Why is the incidence of mental illness in the UK twice that in Germany? Why are Americans three times more likely than the Dutch to develop gambling problems? Why is child well-being so much worse in New Zealand than Japan? As this groundbreaking study demonstrates, the answer to all these hinges on inequality.  In  The Spirit Level  Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett put inequality at the centre of public debate by showing conclusively that less-equal societies fare worse than more equal ones across everything from education to life expectancy.  The Inner Level  now explains how inequality affects us individually, how it alters how we think, feel and behave. It sets out the overwhelming evidence that material inequalities have powerful psychological effects: when the gap between rich and poor increases, so does the tendency to defi ne and value ourselves and others in terms of superiority and inferiority. A deep well of data and analysis is drawn upon to empirically show, for example, that low social status is associated with elevated levels of stress, and how rates of anxiety and depression are intimately related to the inequality which makes that status paramount.  Wilkinson and Pickett describe how these responses to hierarchies evolved, and why the impacts of inequality on us are so severe. In doing so, they challenge the conception that humans are innately competitive and self-interested. They undermine, too, the idea that inequality is the product of 'natural' differences in individual ability. This book sheds new light on many of the most urgent problems facing societies today, but it is not just an index of our ills. It demonstrates that societies based on fundamental equalities, sharing and reciprocity generate much higher levels of well-being, and lays out the path towards them. "

                "'This searching exploration uses sports to examine questions of race and identity ... Bardowell does an excellent and passionate job of refracting the issues within sport \u2013 the dearth of black football managers, the lack of activism from black athletes who have made it into the spotlight \u2013 into wider society.' Financial Times 'A painful reflection of racism in British sport ... Bardowell ably demonstrates the power of the media to determine the narratives around these sporting lives. He flags up the false binaries often promoted between good (patriotic) and bad (self-centred) black sportswomen and men ... it's a valuable act of remembrance of sporting stars who put their careers on the line in pursuit of a moral right.' Observer Few people watch sport for its politics. Yet what happens on the field of play often reflects the problems in our society. Such was the case in the eighties, when black footballers emerged from the dressing room to find bananas being hurled from the stands, and racially motivated attacks and police harassment were the norm. Today, things have improved. Crowds are less hostile and stars like Anthony Joshua and Sir Mohamed Farah are among our most revered sporting heroes. But for athletes of colour, success on the field seldom converts to power away from it. Prejudice and abuse may be less overt, but they remain \u2013 often in front of our eyes, often without us being aware. The same can be said of British society: things are better, yet we continue to be divided by and in denial of racism. No Win Race is a personal exploration of the complexities and biases implicit in being black in Britain, told through the prism of sport. Covering the period between the Brixton 'riots' and Brexit, this is a book for those who want honest insight into UK race relations, and for anyone who senses that sport is more than just a game. "

                "Feminism is often presented as a women's movement, but the truth is that harnessing women's untapped potential will make everyone better off... including men! Looking to our personal relationships, social and cultural climate and business and economic potential, The Power of Women debunks the myths around feminism, and proves why an intersectional approach to bringing women to the table is key to personal, social and economic progress for society as a whole. Praise for June Sarpong's Diversify: 'June Sarpong examines the research behind diversity and discrimination while grounding them in personal narratives, highlighting our common humanity.' Kofi Annan, co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize 'I am so glad June Sarpong is working on this matter of diversity.' Desmond Tutu \"A passionately written polemic\" You Magazine 'An engaging read with lots of important and good ideas' Stylist 'May prove to be our handbook to negotiate these troubled times' Psychologies.

They argue that digital technologies create alternative worlds that many boys find less demanding and more rewarding than real life, yet which are ultimately harmful.There is hope. Man Disconnected reveals where the solutions are to be found, and what action we can take. Controversial, provocative and insightful, this book is an alarm call ignored at our peril. "

The results are intriguing, startling, and often very amusing. For instance, did you know that. . .? Male testosterone levels drop in happy marriages; scientists speculate that women may use monogamy to control male behavior? Young female children who are in day-care are apt to be more secure than those kept at home; young male children less so? Anthropologists classify Western societies as \"mildly polygamous\" The Los Angeles Times has called Sex on the Brain \"superbly crafted science writing, graced by unusual compassion, wit, and intelligence, that forms an important addition to the literature of gender studies.\" "

Jack Urwin traces modern ideas of masculinity from the inability of older generations to deal with the horrors of war, to the mob mentality of football terraces or Fight Club and the disturbing rise of mental health problems among men &#8211; especially young men &#8211; today.  While we struggle with the idea that there is a single version of masculinity worth aspiring to, depression and suicide among men have reached unprecedented levels. Man Up looks at the challenges and pressures on men today, and suggests ways to survive. "

Staffed by Moscow-trained nationals closely monitored by KGB 'ambassadors', Poland's UB, the Czech StB, the Hungarian AVH, Romania's Securitate, Bulgaria's KDS and the ultra-Stalinist Stasi of the German Democratic Republic all repressed democratic movements in their respective countries for forty years. They arrested and imprisoned without trial anyone not toeing the Moscow line, earning the hatred of their compatriots. When this boiled over - in GDR 1953, Hungary 1956 and Czechoslovakia 1968 - Russian troops and tanks mowed down unarmed protestors. The 'daughters' also carried out espionage and mokrye dyela assassinations for Moscow in Britain and other Western countries, such as the murder of Bulgarian defector Georgi Markov on Waterloo Bridge in 1978, and occasionally hired professional hit men, including the notorious assassin Carlos the Jackal. Historian and author Douglas Boyd explores for the first time the relationship between the KGB and its ghastly brood of 'daughters' - a true family from hell. "

And, of course, there's her mother -- whether she's writing another ingratiating letter to the Queen or repeatedly referring to Tom Jones as 'Thumb Jone'.  But Zaiba's story is also one of anxiety and seemingly irreconcilable opposites. Growing up she is constantly torn between two identities: 'British' and 'Muslim'. Alienated at school and confused at home, the racism she encounters as a child mirrors the horrors she experiences at the hands of Bangladeshi interrogators  as a journalist years later.  We Are A Muslim, Please is a stirring and enchanting memoir. We see, through Zaiba's childhood eyes, the poignancy of growing up in a world whose prejudices, contradictions and ambiguities are at once distressing and utterly captivating. "

Kennedy Book Award  * An NPR, Los Angeles Times, and  Atlanta Journal-Constitution  Best Book of the Year *  In 1955, white men in the Mississippi Delta lynched a fourteen-year-old from Chicago named Emmett Till. His murder was part of a wave of white terrorism in the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared public school segregation unconstitutional. Only weeks later, Rosa Parks thought about young Emmett as she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Five years later, Black students who called themselves \"the Emmett Till generation\" launched sit-in campaigns that turned the struggle for civil rights into a mass movement. Till's lynching became the most notorious hate crime in American history.   But what actually happened to Emmett Till\u2014not the icon of injustice, but the flesh-and-blood boy? Part detective story, part political history,  The Blood of Emmett Till  \"unfolds like a movie\" ( The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ), drawing on a wealth of new evidence, including a shocking admission of Till's innocence from the woman in whose name he was killed. \"Jolting and powerful\" ( The Washington Post ), the book \"provides fresh insight into the way race has informed and deformed our democratic institutions\" (Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author of  Carry Me Home ) and \"calls us to the cause of justice today\" (Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, president of the North Carolina NAACP). "

In an adventure worthy of Indiana Jones, archeologist von Petzinger explores the little-known geometric cave art of our ancient ancestors\u2014perhaps the first form of human written communication and a key to unlocking some of the mysteries of our ancient past. These \"remarkable\" (Jean Auel, author of the bestselling Earth's Children series) findings \"may represent one of the most extraordinary scientific insights of our time\" (Wade Davis, author of  The Serpent and the Rainbow ).    Join von Petzinger as she travels throughout Europe and attempts to crack the code of these strange symbols, which persisted virtually unchanged for some 30,000 years. Clearly meaningful to their creators, these geometric signs are one of the first indicators of our human ancestors' intelligence and capacity for symbolic meaning and language\u2014glimpses across millennia of an ancient consciousness linked to our own.    Part travel journal, part popular science, and part personal narrative, this groundbreaking investigation explores what makes us human, how we evolved as a species, and how this cave art laid the foundation for so much of the technology that we enjoy today.

Lessons in breaking the curse of the good girl-from the bestselling author of Odd Girl Out Rachel Simmons argues that in idealizing the \"good girl\"-unerringly nice, polite, modest, and selfless- we teach girls to embrace a version of selfhood that curtails their power and potential.Drawing on the exercises Simmons herself uses in her work with girls, parents, and educators, The Curse of the Good Girl provides a catalog of practical strategies to foster girls' assertiveness, resilience, and integrity. At the core of Simmons's radical argument is her belief that the most critical freedom we can win for our daughters is the liberty not only to listen to their inner voice but also to act on it. "

Following in the tradition of John Howard Griffin (Black Like Me), Norah spent a year and a half disguised as her male alter ego, Ned, exploring what men are like when women aren't around. As Ned, she joins a bowling team, takes a high-octane sales job, goes on dates with women (and men), visits strip clubs, and even manages to infiltrate a monastery and a men's therapy group. At once thought- provoking and pure fun to read, Self-Made Man is a sympathetic and thrilling tour de force of immersion journalism. "
