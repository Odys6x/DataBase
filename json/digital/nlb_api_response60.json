Should he tell the truth about his old nemesis George Wickham in order to protect the good citizens of Meryton from Wickham's lies and deceits? Doing so will force Darcy to reveal family secrets that he'd prefer never come to light. The alternative is keeping the man's criminal nature to himself and hoping he leaves the area before doing significant harm. But as Wickham's attentions to Elizabeth increase, Darcy knows if he's to win the one woman he's set his heart on, he's going to have to make one of the most difficult decisions of his life. And what he ultimately does sets in motion a shocking train of events neither he nor Elizabeth could possibly have predicted. "

Would she make the same mistakes I did, or would she learn from mine? Margaret of Anjou, queen of England, cannot give up on her husband-even when he slips into insanity. And as mother to the House of Lancaster's last hope, she cannot give up on her son-even when England turns against them. This gripping tale of a queen forced to stand strong in the face of overwhelming odds is at its heart a tender tale of love. Award-winning author Susan Higginbotham will once again ask readers to question everything they know about right and wrong, compassion and hope, duty to one's country and the desire of one's own heart. Praise for Susan Higginbotham A beautiful blending of turbulent history and deeply felt fiction, Susan Higginbotham's The Queen of Last Hopes brings alive an amazing woman often overlooked or slandered by historians. Higginbotham has given readers of historical fiction a gift to treasure. -Karen Harper, New York Times bestselling author of The Irish Princess A compelling, fast paced, and well-written saga that is destined to both entertain and educate anyone interested in the spirited and fascinating Margaret of Anjou for generations to come! -D. L. Bogdan, author of Secrets of the Tudor Court The Queen of Last Hopes is an inspiring novel of a woman who, in the face of betrayal and loss, would not surrender. Susan Higginbotham brings Margaret of Anjou to life and tells the story of the Frenchwoman who was one of the strongest queens England has ever known. -Christy English, author of The Queen's Pawn and To Be Queen.

Bored and restless, he jumps at the chance to go east to help the son of his late friend Doc Holliday. The young man's mother fears her gambler son will lose everything, including his life, in wild and woolly Manhattan, where Johnny Holliday has opened one of the first, and glitziest, speakeasy nightclubs. Wyatt's onetime deputy, Bat Masterson, joins the defense of young Holliday against a new breed of badmen--mobsters led by Brooklyn's brash, brutal Alphonse Capone. Young Al and his sadistic boss Frankie Yale have targeted Holliday's nightspot, where jazz-baby diva Texas Guinan is welcoming suckers and money is flowing like bootleg beer ... "

Then a beautiful young woman is found raped and savagely murdered on the altar steps of an ancient church near Westminster Abbey. A dueling pistol discovered at the scene and the damning testimony of a witness both point to one man, Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, a brilliant young nobleman shattered by his experience in the Napoleonic Wars. Now a fugitive running for his life, Sebastian calls upon his skill as an agent during the war to catch the killer and prove his own innocence. In the process, he accumulates a band of unlikely allies, including the enigmatic beauty Kat Boleyn, who broke Sebastian's heart years ago. In Sebastian's world of intrigue and espionage, nothing is as it seems, yet the truth may hold the key to the future of the British monarchy, as well as to Sebastian's own salvation. "

But when carpetbagger George Whitehead arrives in Rosings, all that Beth thought to be true is turned on its head, and the only man who can save her home is the one she swore she'd never trust.--From cover.

Drunk and agitated, he ventures into the lawless part of Sedonia to do just that. But the gentry do not belong here; he is soon wounded and unconscious. When he awakes he finds himself in the thief's den. Then an angel appears, with long blond hair that makes him forget his pain and his mission. But she is the princess of thieves, and he soon realises that nothing is as it seems, including the woman he is slowly coming to love. "

Here is popular Chinese fiction at its best. This socially and psychologically incisive portrait of modern China can be read with great return against issues of gender, class, and modernity. And if this is not enough, it is also a travelogue, providing a delightful read for anyone who has traveled or is simply curious about traveling by train in China. First serialized in Shanghai in 1935, Shanghai Express appears now in English for the first time. "

Normally, telling them no wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that the good guys I protect think that I'm an even worse demon than the ones we fight. Hmm, maybe they're right. I have to say that I do enjoy maiming anyone who gets in my way. At least until my mother gives me a simple choice: join Morgen's Circle of the Damned or see an innocent woman die. I'm all for saving the innocent, but Merewyn isn't as innocent as she seems. And she's none too fond of the fact that her fate is in my dubious hands. Personally I'm all for taking the easy way out, but leaving her to Morgen is rough, even for me. Now the only way to save both our lives is to face the evilest forces ever known--my mother and Morgen.

In their exile, Will and Mary encounter Hosteen Tse, a great Navajo leader and fount of tribal lore who pleads for aid for his starving people. Will and Mary do what they can to help, which is little in a time when banks are failing and old friends are turning to theft.\"--BOOK JACKET. \"Just when things look darkest, Roosevelt and his New Deal programs bring both hope and new tensions. Will is drawn into a conflict when Joe Garlen, a skilled mechanic who antagonizes everyone, seduces the niece of Franklin Begay. Franklin, Will's Navajo assistant and only close friend, seeks revenge, and he makes Will an unwitting accomplice. And the troubles keep mounting, as one teacher barricades herself in her cottage out of fear of the Navajos, and a talented young athlete known as \"the Navajo Jim Thorpe\" sees his dreams of a career in professional baseball tragically shattered by Jim Crow laws.\"--Jacket.

Austen would surely give her smile of approval.?Beverly Wong, author of PRIDE & PREJUDICE PRUDENCE An unconventional newcomer brings the threat of scandal to Pemberley Kate O'Hare is not a typical Victorian woman. Her intelligence, vivacity, and beauty captivate all those around her, including the young and handsome Darcy Gardiner. But she cares more about science than about dresses, and her unusual behavior makes her a fresh and interesting addition to the Pemberley estate. Until her association with scientific controversies of the day and dark secrets from her past put her and all her newfound friends in harm's way. Will Kate's involvement in the public world, where many believe a woman doesn't belong, bring scandal to Pemberley? Or will her charm and wit be enough to banish the shadows of her past and hold on to Darcy Gardiner? Inventive plot lines, credible characters, and an engaging style. Add to this an enviable knowledge of the history and culture of the period and a sensitive appreciation of the values and traditions that underlie the novels of Jane Austen, and it is not difficult to understand the popularity of her work. Book News Truly a masterpiece that any Austen fan would enjoy. Beverly Wong, author of Pride & Prejudice Prudence This is the seventh in the bestselling Jane Austen sequel series The Pemberley Chronicles from Rebecca Ann Collins. "

                "When Elizabeth Bennet refuses his hand, Darcy is devastated and makes it his mission to change. By every civility in his power, Darcy slowly tries to win her affections, but Elizabeth is not easily swayed. Darcy vows to unlock the secrets that will make her his. He curses himself for his social awkwardness and appearance of pride, and sets out to right the wrongs he's done her family. Elizabeth's family and friends misunderstand his intentions, and being in Elizabeth's presence proves to be both excruciating for the shy Darcy-and a dream come true. For the first time in his life, he must please a woman worth having, and the transformation leads him to a depth of understanding and love that he never could have imagined. "
