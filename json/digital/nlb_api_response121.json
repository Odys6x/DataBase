While none of the stories have happened, there is no reason why they could not. You could argue it provides a road map for criminal hackers, but I say it does something else: it provides a glimpse into the creative minds of some of today's best hackers, and even the best hackers will tell you that the game is a mental one.\"--The Foreword to the first Stealing the Network book, How to Own the Box, Jeff Moss, Founder & Director, Black H.

Featuring a selection of outcast short stories too weird or uncomfortable for serious literary journals and too visceral and punk rock for contemporary mainstream palettes, this collection culled from the magazine introduces the best of Canadian underground fiction and beyond. Ragged and lacking the traditional refinement of metaphor, magical realism, and perfect epiphanies, these pieces breach the surface with sharp, offensive urban fiction where voices are discovered and developed and the words do all the work.

                "The stories in this memorable collection explore the rigors of life in northern Michigan, a harsh terrain where winters linger, marriages often fail, and the emotional climate can be as severe as the physical one. Jack Driscoll writes about ordinary working-class people struggling to get along as best they can. With remarkable control, he portrays the uncertainty and impulsiveness of boys on the edge of manhood, the loneliness of women cut off from their families, and the ambivalence and anger of men who have come to see that love is neither simple nor secure. In the title story, three boys in the dead of winter test their theory that it should be possible to swim underwater from one ice-fishing hole to the next. In \"Pig and Lobsters\" a son watches his father plan a fancy dinner for a date who never arrives, the father's anticipation turning to rage as the evening unfolds. \"August Sales\" tells the story of a census worker with a chronic sleepwalking disorder who is haunted by his wife's decision to leave him. The protagonist of \"Devotion,\" a woman recovering from dental surgery, finds herself holding a gun on a young intruder who has broken into her house. In each story, Driscoll masterfully conveys the fragility of human contact and the complex topography of the heart. "

                "Heroines in Sondra Spatt Olsen's compelling stories often find themselves in bad situations: a wife with an irresponsible husband, an older woman who wants to leave her younger lover, a suburban housewife who wants sex with her doctor, a teacher who falls in love with her student, a young girl haunted by her mother's judgments, a demanding career woman unsettled by her boyfriend's success, a young woman who finds that her friends, when drunk, are potential murderers. But just as Chekhov gives us pleasure from moments of pain, Olsen illuminates the universal humor and pathos of bad situations. "

                "In the sparsely settled hills of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, winter's toughness is matched only by the animosity and affection of its inhabitants for each other and for the land that unnerves them. In The Long White, Sharon Dilworth evokes a place dominated by two great lakes whose power and ferocity influence the lives of every inhabitant. The particularities of place and character come together with the clarity and exactitude of a fresh snowfall that both veils and illuminates a landscape. "

                "The stories in this memorable collection explore the rigors of life in northern Michigan, a harsh terrain where winters linger, marriages often fail, and the emotional climate can be as severe as the physical one. Jack Driscoll writes about ordinary working-class people struggling to get along as best they can. With remarkable control, he portrays the uncertainty and impulsiveness of boys on the edge of manhood, the loneliness of women cut off from their families, and the ambivalence and anger of men who have come to see that love is neither simple nor secure. In the title story, three boys in the dead of winter test their theory that it should be possible to swim underwater from one ice-fishing hole to the next. In \"Pig and Lobsters\" a son watches his father plan a fancy dinner for a date who never arrives, the father's anticipation turning to rage as the evening unfolds. \"August Sales\" tells the story of a census worker with a chronic sleepwalking disorder who is haunted by his wife's decision to leave him. The protagonist of \"Devotion,\" a woman recovering from dental surgery, finds herself holding a gun on a young intruder who has broken into her house. In each story, Driscoll masterfully conveys the fragility of human contact and the complex topography of the heart. "

                "MOVING BACK CAN MEAN MOVING FORWARD...AT A PRICE  As card-carrying members of the Sixties counter-culture, seven friends decide to abandon life in the mainstream and move back to the land. Phil and Marina join the unreliable Noah and his ever-changing band of acolytes in living off the grid.  But good intentions meet reality\u2014and passion. The commune quickly splinters, with a hard core of originals staying on the land and the rest heading home to the city.  In a series of linked short stories, The Necessary Havoc of Love follows the old friends and their growing children from the 1970s through to the pandemic. We meet a national radio host, a human rights worker, a computer mogul and a craftswoman. All are restless seekers, looking for love or fleeing its failure. We follow them from an Indian ashram to a coffee plantation in Panama, from Mexico City to Tasmania and back to Vancouver. Along the way, the old friends face decades of change while struggling to stay true to themselves, always asking a central question.  What does it mean to live a worthwhile life?  The first death among the original communards brings the survivors back together in a moving finale. As one of the friends says in her elegy, \"It's a clich\u00e9, and it's na\u00efve, but it's true: Our generation hoped to make the world a better place.\" Whether they succeeded\u2014whether any one person can succeed\u2014leaves all of them wrestling with their choices.  Some of the stories have won major awards, while others are new and unpublished. Together, they highlight both the havoc and the necessity of love. "

With the success of the Hulu series  11/22/63  starring James Franco and the highly anticipated  The Dark Tower  movie release, Stephen King's brand is stronger than ever. This collection, nominated for a Locus Award, is guaranteed to keep readers awake long after bedtime, and features an introduction and prefatory notes to each novella by the author. \"Stephen King is a master storyteller, and you will never forget these stories,\" raves the  Seattle Times  about  Four Past Midnight .     One Past Midnight : \"The Langoliers\" takes a red-eye flight from LA to Boston into a most unfriendly sky. Only eleven passengers survive, but landing in an eerily empty world makes them wish they hadn't. Something's waiting for them, you see.     Two Past Midnight : \"Secret Window, Secret Garden\" enters the suddenly strange life of writer Mort Rainey, recently divorced, depressed, and alone on the shore of Tashmore Lake. Alone, that is, until a figure named John Shooter arrives, pointing an accusing finger.     Three Past Midnight : \"The Library Policeman\" is set in Junction City, Iowa, an unlikely place for evil to be hiding. But for small businessman Sam Peebles, who thinks he may be losing his mind, another enemy is hiding there as well\u2014the truth. If he can find it in time, he might stand a chance.     Four Past Midnight : \"The Sun Dog,\" a menacing black dog, appears in every Polaroid picture that fifteen-year-old Kevin Delevan takes with his new camera, beckoning him to the supernatural. Old Pop Merrill, Castle Rock's sharpest trader, aims to exploit The Sun Dog for profit, but this creature that shouldn't exist at all, is a very dangerous investment. "
