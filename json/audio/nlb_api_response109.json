Smart, funny, brave and deeply thoughtful,  The Psychology of Secrets  is an absolute must read\"  -  Will Storr ,  bestselling author of  The Status Game  and  The Science of Storytelling    \u2014   Cult leaders, murderers, psychopaths \u2013 and you. Take a deep dive into the bizarre psychology of secrecy with Andrew Gold, award-winning investigative journalist and host of  On the Edge With Andrew Gold .   We all keep secrets. 97 per cent of us are hiding a secret right now, and on average we each hold thirteen at any one time. There's a one-in-two chance that those secrets involve a breach of trust, a lie or a financial impropriety. They are the stuff of gossip, of novels and of classic dramas; secrets form a major part of our hidden inner lives. Andrew Gold knows this better than anyone. As a public figure, he has found himself the unwitting recipient of hundreds of strangers' most private revelations. This set him on a journey to understand this critical part of our societies and lives. Why do we keep secrets? Why are we fascinated by those of others? What happens to our mind when we confess?  Drawing from psychology, history, social science, philosophy and personal interviews,  The Psychology of Secrets  is a rollicking journey through the history of secrecy.  \u2014  \"That Andrew Gold is a truly edgy journalist, broadcaster and now writer is - but should not be - one of our culture's best kept secrets\" - David Baddiel, bestselling author of  The God Desire.

                "'A TRULY IMPORTANT BOOK' JOHN HUMPHRYS 'FASCINATING... SHOCKING' SPECTATOR What is paranoia? What makes us mistrustful? How can this be overcome? Daniel Freeman, Professor of Psychology at Oxford, has spent thirty years at the vanguard of paranoia research and treatment. This remarkable and moving book tells the story of that journey. For decades, conventional wisdom held that paranoia was only experienced by people with severe mental health problems and little could be done to rectify its disastrous effects. Paranoia gives us a front row seat as Freeman turns the traditional view on its head. He develops life-changing treatments for clinical paranoia \u2013 often using state-of-the-art technology like virtual reality. He reveals that suspicion is rife in society, with paranoia widespread, conspiracy theories rampant and emotion all too often trumping evidence. He discovers the causes of mistrust, including the role of genes, trauma, lack of sleep, worry, low self-confidence, cannabis use and hearing voices, and delves into the murky world of Covid-19 conspiracy theories. Lighting up the narrative throughout are the rarely heard voices of people whose lives have been almost wrecked by paranoia \u2013 and then in many cases transformed by Freeman's groundbreaking treatments. This is also a practical book. Freeman shows how we can measure our own levels of mistrust. He explains how we can remedy things if those levels are higher than we'd like, because although mistrust can seem engrained, things can change for the better. Ultimately, it can be overcome. Compelling and compassionate, this is a gripping tale from the front line of suspicion \u2013 an impassioned plea for the urgent rebuilding of trust between us all. "

                "A fascinating, enchanting and painfully personal look at the meaning of luck, and the way in which it has shaped our shared history and continues to inflect our day to day lives. What does it mean to be lucky? How might we mitigate the effects of bad luck and maximise those of good? Is there actually such a thing as 'luck'\u2014some force that intervenes between desire and its consummation, that impedes or hastens it? To answer these questions, David Flusfeder sets out on a search for the definition of luck. This quest will take him to Siberia, Versailles, the Old Testament desert; play roulette in Baden-Baden with Dostoevsky; visit a Cambridge fairground with Wittgenstein; meet the sixteenth-century poet Thomas Bastard, who challenged Fortune, and lost; find Nietzsche on the slopes of Vesuvius; learn about the pioneers of probability; the twentieth-century art investigators of chance and possibility; and the intensely personal story of his father's good fortune in escaping war-time Poland. Starting at the British Library in London, and following the dictates of an online randomiser that decided the chapter order, Flusfeder follows in the footsteps of some victors of luck and those who were defeated by it, from ancient times to the modern day. Luck asks fundamental questions about the world, ourselves, our place in it. In these questions, about our relationships to fortune, to risk, to opportunity, to chance, destiny and fate, we find ourselves deciding who we are and how we might choose to live. "

                "This series of mindfulness meditations will help you to appreciate life in the present moment as you connect with your senses, thoughts and feelings. This is the second title in the series which has been designed to help you release anxiety and worry. People who practice mindfulness are less likely to get caught up in worries about the future or regrets over the past. Being mindful makes it easier to notice and enjoy the pleasures in life as they unfold. It also improves the way you react to stressful or difficult situations, allowing you to feel calmer and more balanced in everyday life. This recording will help you to learn the empowering skill of anchoring yourself in the present moment. Glenn will guide you through each area of your body and encourage you to notice any sensations or feelings as they occur. You will then be guided through a beautiful visualisation by a lake which is aimed at helping you to become aware of individual thoughts, without any judgement. Whenever you feel worried, anxious or stressed you can learn to simply notice your thoughts as they come and go. When you observe each thought from a distance, rather than getting caught up in it, you will naturally find this releases you from the cycle of anxiety and worry. You will also learn to use your breathing to anchor yourself in the present moment whenever you need it. This will help you feel calm and composed when you are faced with stressful situations in your life. Glenn's acclaimed meditation techniques combine with deeply relaxing music by Russ Davey to create a powerful session that will help you make lasting and meaningful changes to your life. Russ's music blends dreamy piano and guitar sounds with calming atmospheric soundscapes, heavenly choirs, chimes and Tibetan chanting. Mindfulness takes practice, so for best results, we recommend listening to this 33-minute session once a day. This download also includes a 10 minute edited version of the main track and is ideal as a booster when your time is limited. With regular use you will be much more in control of your feelings and be able cope more easily with the ups and downs of life. "

                "How have our emotions shaped the course of human history? And how have our experience and understanding of emotions evolved with us? We humans like to think of ourselves as rational creatures, who, as a species, have relied on calculation and intellect to survive. But many of the most important moments in our history had little to do with cold, hard facts and a lot to do with feelings. Events ranging from the origins of philosophy to the birth of the world's major religions, the fall of Rome, the Scientific Revolution, and some of the bloodiest wars that humanity has ever experienced can't be properly understood without understanding emotions. In A Human History of Emotion, Richard Firth-Godbehere takes readers on a fascinating and wide-ranging tour of the central and often under-appreciated role emotions have played in human societies around the world and throughout history \u2013 from Ancient Greece to Gambia, Japan, the Ottoman Empire, Britain, and beyond.\u00a0Drawing on psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, art, and religious history, A Human History of Emotion vividly illustrates how our understanding and experience of emotions has changed over time, and how our beliefs about feelings \u2013 and our feelings themselves \u2013 profoundly shaped us and the world we inhabit.

                "How do great leaders thrive in uncertain times? By changing their mindsets about power. If you let go of hierarchy, chaos will reign...or so many leaders believe. But when leaders find the courage to distribute rather than hoard power, creativity multiplies, trust deepens, and inclusivity expands...and a new kind of order emerges. For decades, leaders forced their organizations to look like a pyramid, with all authority flowing from the top. That didn't work. Next, experts told leaders to adopt \"bottom-up\" leadership. But that's not working either. Top-down and bottom-up are the same organizational shape. And neither approach really enables innovation, collaboration, or enthusiasm. The problem is the Pyramid. A few rare leaders have seen the pyramid for the trap that it is and have learned to embrace a new shape and mindset: Constellations. Organizations designed as constellations are dynamic and flexible networks of distinct yet interwoven individuals. Each member of the team feels like a singular star and is also connected to others to form something greater. That is how Visa reimagined how we pay for things, how Wikipedia beat the richest company in the world and how Barack Obama and his grassroots team revolutionized political campaigning. These leaders did what most leaders dread \u2013 they gave away power. In this practical and personal journey, Barzun brilliantly layers lessons across history and industries with his own experiences as an internet entrepreneur, political organizer, and US ambassador to the United Kingdom and Sweden. With lessons for leaders of all types, The Power of Giving Away Power shows how the Constellation mindset shines in some of the most impactful organizations and innovations the world has ever known. And it encourages us all to recognize, as Barzun writes, \"the power we can create by seeing the power in others\" \u2014 and making the leap to lead. Together. "

                "From the world-leaders in strategic thinking and the multi-million copy bestselling authors of Thinking Fast and Slow and Nudge, the next big book to change the way you think. Wherever there is human judgment, there is noise. 'Noise may be the most important book I've read in more than a decade. A genuinely new idea so\u00a0exceedingly important you will immediately put it into practice. A masterpiece' Angela Duckworth, author of Grit 'An absolutely brilliant investigation of a massive societal problem that has been hiding in plain sight' Steven Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics Imagine that two doctors in the same city give different diagnoses to identical patients \u2013 or that two judges in the same court give different sentences to people who have committed matching crimes. Now imagine that the same doctor and the same judge make different decisions depending on whether it is morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday, or they haven't yet had lunch. These are examples of noise: variability in judgments that should be identical. In Noise, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R. Sunstein show how noise produces errors in many fields, including in medicine, law, public health, economic forecasting, forensic science, child protection, creative strategy, performance review and hiring. And although noise can be found wherever people are making judgments and decisions, individuals and organizations alike commonly ignore its impact, at great cost. Packed with new ideas, and drawing on the same kind of sharp analysis and breadth of case study that made Thinking, Fast and Slow and Nudge international bestsellers, Noise explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise and bias in decision-making. We all make bad judgments more than we think. With a few simple remedies, this groundbreaking book explores what we can do to make better ones. "

                "Digital Body Language How to Build Trust and Connection, No Matter the Distance The book we all read right now: the definitive guide to communicating and connecting wherever you are. Email replies that show up a week later. Video chats full of 'oops sorry no you go' and 'can you hear me?!' Ambiguous text-messages. Weird punctuation you can't make heads or tails of. Is it any wonder communication takes us so much time and effort to figure out? How did we lose our innate capacity to understand each other? Humans rely on body language to connect and build trust, but with most of our communication happening from behind a screen, traditional body language signals are no longer visible \u2013 or are they? In Digital Body Language, Erica Dhawan, a go-to thought leader on collaboration and a passionate communication junkie, combines cutting edge research with engaging storytelling to decode the new signals and cues that have replaced traditional body language across genders, generations, and culture. In real life, we lean in, uncross our arms, smile, nod and make eye contact to show we listen and care. Online, reading carefully is the new listening. Writing clearly is the new empathy. And a phone or video call is worth a thousand emails. Digital Body Language will turn your daily misunderstandings into a set of collectively understood laws that foster connection, no matter the distance. Dhawan investigates a wide array of exchanges\u2014from large conferences and video meetings to daily emails, texts, IMs, and conference calls\u2014and offers insights and solutions to build trust and clarity to anyone in our ever changing world. \"We need Erica Dhawan's book more than ever.\" \u2015Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and founder of Lean In\u00a0\"An indispensable guide to a business world turned upside down by video calls, group texts, and remote work.\" \u2015Daniel H. Pink, bestselling author of\u00a0Drive \"This book is a breakthrough that will be read for years to come\" \u2015Seth Godin, author of\u00a0The Practice. "

Yet, sadness happens to us all, sometimes in heartbreakingly awful ways. If we don't know how to be sad, it can be isolating for those experiencing it and baffling for those trying to help loved ones through dark times. Today, most of us know intellectually that 'sad' is normal. But we're not always brilliant at allowing for it, in practice. Sadness is going to happen, so we might as well know how to 'do it' right. And it's time to start facing our problems and talking about them. Positive psychology may have become more accepted in mainstream culture, but rates of depression have continued to rise. We're trying so hard to be happy. But studies show that we could all benefit from learning the art of sadness and how to handle it, well. "

Thought-provoking'Kathryn Mannix, author of With the End in Mind In the face of discrimination, bad behaviour, evil and abuse, why do good people so often do nothing? Every day, we see examples of bad or immoral behaviour \u2013 from sexual harassment to political corruption, from negligence to bullying. Why did no one stop the abduction of Jamie Bulger, despite many witnesses reporting they felt uneasy seeing the two-year-old's distress? How did the USA gymnastics team doctor, Larry Nassar, abuse hundreds of young women under his care for so long? Why didn't anyone intervene when David Dao, an innocent sixty-nine-year-old man, was forcibly removed from his seat on a United Airlines aeroplane and dragged down the aisle by security officers? How did large crowds of men get away with sexually assaulting an estimated 1,200 women in Cologne during the 2015 New Year's Eve celebrations? In The Bystander Effect, pioneering psychologist Catherine Sanderson uses real-life examples, neuroscience and the latest psychological studies to explain why we might be good at recognising bad behaviour but bad at taking action against it. With practical strategies to transform your thinking, she shows how we can all learn to speak out, intervene, think outside the group mentality and ultimately become braver versions of ourselves. Courage is not a virtue we're born with. A bystander can learn to be brave. "

The results speak for themselves. Now in his forties, Dave is smarter, happier, and more fit and successful than ever before. In Super Human, he shows how this is level of health and performance possible for all of us. While we assume we will peak in middle age and then decline, Asprey's research reveals there is another way. It is possible to make changes on the sub-cellular level to dramatically extend life span. And the tools to live longer also give you more energy and brainpower right now. The answers lie in Dave's Seven Pillars of Ageing that contribute to degeneration and disease while diminishing your performance in the moment. Using simple interventions \u2013 like diet, sleep, light, exercise, and little-known but powerful hacks from ozone therapy to proper jaw alignment, you can decelerate cellular ageing and supercharge your body's ability to heal and rejuvenate. A self-proclaimed human guinea pig, Asprey arms readers with practical advice to maximize their lives at every age with his signature mix of science-geek wonder, candour, and enthusiasm. Getting older no longer has to mean decline. Now it's an opportunity to become Super Human. "

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is the most popular personality test in the world. It has been harnessed by Fortune 100 companies, universities, hospitals, churches, and the military. Its language \u2013 of extraversion vs. introversion, thinking vs. feeling \u2013 has inspired online dating platforms and Buzzfeed quizzes alike. And yet despite the test's widespread adoption, experts in the field of psychometric testing, a $500 million industry, struggle to account for its success \u2013 no less validate its results. How did the Myers-Briggs insinuate itself into our jobs, our relationships, our internet, our lives? First conceived in the 1920s by the mother-daughter team of Katherine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, a pair of aspiring novelists and devoted homemakers, the Myers-Briggs was designed to bring the gospel of Carl Jung to the masses. But it would take on a life of its own, reaching from the smoke-filled boardrooms of mid-century New York to Berkeley, California, where it was honed against some of the 20th century's greatest creative minds. It would travel across the world to London, Zurich, Cape Town, Melbourne, and Tokyo; to elementary schools, nunneries, wellness retreats, and the closed-door corporate training sessions of today. Drawing from original reporting and never-before-published documents, What's Your Type? examines nothing less than the definition of the self \u2013 our attempts to grasp, categorise and quantify our personalities. Surprising and absorbing, the book, like the test at its heart, considers the timeless question: What makes you you?. "

For our diets to change, we need to relearn the food experiences that first shaped us. Everyone starts drinking milk. After that it's all up for grabs. We are not born knowing what to eat; we each have to figure it out for ourselves. From childhood onwards, we learn how big a portion is and how sweet is too sweet. We learn to love broccoli &#8211; or not. But how does this happen? What are the origins of taste? And once we acquire our food habits, can we ever change them for the better? In First Bite, award-winning food writer Bee Wilson draws on the latest research from food psychologists, neuroscientists and nutritionists to reveal how our food habits are shaped by a whole host of factors: family and culture, memory and gender, hunger and love. She looks at the effects siblings can have on eating choices and the social pressures to eat according to sex. Bee introduces us to people who can only eat food of a certain colour; toddlers who will eat nothing but hot dogs; doctors who have found radical new ways to help children eat vegetables. First Bite also looks at how people eat in different parts of the world: we see how grandparents in China overfeed their grandchildren, and how Japan came to adopt such a healthy diet (it wasn't always so). The way we learn to eat holds the key to why food has gone so disastrously wrong for so many people. But Bee Wilson also shows that both adults and children have immense potential for learning new, healthy eating habits. An exploration of the extraordinary and surprising origins of our taste and eating habits, First Bite explains how we can change our palates to lead healthier, happier lives. "

This recording will guide you into a deeply relaxed hypnotic trance state. In this receptive state you will absorb a number of multiple layered post hypnotic suggestions for developing self-confidence and being assertive when you need to be. When you assert yourself in a respectful and confident way people will always respond positively and Glenn's skilled hypnotherapy techniques will help you to become assertive and confident in a number of different social settings. This recording can also help you overcome shyness, self-doubt and help you to feel generally more empowered. Hypnotherapy is uniquely effective in programming the mind to overcome self-doubt and develop confidence in a safe and natural way, free of any harmful side effects. The recording includes two hypnotherapy tracks, the first one you can use in the daytime as it will guide you back to full waking consciousness at the end. The second track is identical except that it guides you into a sleep state at the end, which makes it ideal for using before you go to sleep at night. "

                "Attention is not just receptive, but actively creative of the world we inhabit. How we attend makes all the difference to the world we experience. And nowadays in the West we generally attend in a rather unusual way: governed by the narrowly focussed, target-driven left hemisphere of the brain.   Forget everything you thought you knew about the difference between the hemispheres, because it will be largely wrong. It is not what each hemisphere does \u2013 they are both involved in everything \u2013 but how it does it, that matters. And the prime difference between the brain hemispheres is the manner in which they attend. For reasons of survival we need one hemisphere (in humans and many animals, the left) to pay narrow attention to detail, to grab hold of things we need, while the other, the right, keeps an eye out for everything else. The result is that one hemisphere is good at utilising the world, the other better at understanding it.   Absent, present, detached, engaged, alienated, empathic, broad or narrow, sustained or piecemeal, attention has the power to alter whatever it meets.  The play of attention can both create and destroy, but it never leaves its object unchanged. How you attend to something \u2013 or don't attend to it \u2013 matters a very great deal.  This book helps you to see what it is you may have been trained by our very unusual culture not to see.    Ways of Attending  is expertly read by Mike Fraser.

                "Flight, Flight, Mimic  is the first systematic study of deceptive mimicry in the context of wars. Deceptive mimicry\u2014the manipulation of individual or group identity\u2014includes passing off as a different individual, as a member of a group to which one does not belong, or, for a group, to \"sign\" its action as another group. Mimicry exploits the reputation of the model it mimics to avoid capture (flight), to strike undetected at the enemy (fight), or to hide behind or besmirch the reputation of the model group (\"false flag\" operations). These tactics have previously been described anecdotally, mixed in with other ruses de guerre, but the authors show that mimicry is a distinct form of deception with its own logic and particularly consequential effects on those involved. The book offers a theory and game-theoretic model of mimicry, an overview of its use through history, and a deep empirical exploration of its modern manifestations through several case studies by leading social scientists. The chapters cover mimicry in the context of the Northern Ireland conflict, terrorism campaigns in 1970s Italy, the height of the Iraq insurgency, the Rwandan genocide, the Naxalite rebellion in India, and jihadi discussion forums on the Internet.

                "A Guide to The Theory and Practice of Creating Authentic Relationships  When's the last time you  felt  as composed as you portray to your boss, family and friends? If there's a discord between the two, you're not alone. Humans are master pretenders\u2014we often seem stronger, calmer and more mature than we really are, while the truth is we're full of doubts and self-criticism that pushes us to borrow reassurance from friends, beliefs from strangers on the internet, or attention that, in the moment, makes us feel successful, but leaves us totally hollow and burnt out.   True to You  is a relatable self-help guide for people who want to learn to live less focused on others' reactions and more confidently by their own principles. Readers will learn how to:  \u00b7 Interrupt relationship patterns that keep you stuck.  \u00b7 Rely less on praise and approval from others.  \u00b7 Develop a solid sense of self in anxious times.  \u00b7 Build more authentic and rewarding relationships.  Dr. Smith uses examples from the lives of her therapy clients to explain how we borrow confidence, calmness, and beliefs from our relationships and offers actionable steps and exercises for building a life with your own best-thinking. With a healthy dose of humor, she unpacks the science of our social nature, explaining why we try so hard to be what others want us to be and how we can start living from the inside out. By learning how to be more responsible for yourself, rather than over-responsible for everyone else, you can find the freedom to develop richer relationships, pursue what's important to you, and feel steadier in this very anxious world.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press Essentials. "

                "D.W. Winnicott's distinctive contribution to our understanding of human development, based on extensive clinical work with babies and young children, is known and valued the world over.   In  Playing and Reality , he is concerned with the springs of imaginative living and of cultural experience in every sense, with whatever determines an individual's capacity to live creatively and to find life worth living. The ideas expressed here extend the theme first put forward in his paper Transitional Objects and Transitional Phenomena, published in 1953. They relate to an area of experience that has for centuries been a recurrent preoccupation of philosophers and poets. This intermediate area, between internal and external reality, is intensely personal, since its existence depends, as does the use that can be made of it, on each individual's early life experiences. If children can utilize this realm to initiate their relationship with the world, first through transitional objects, and later through play and shared playing, then cultural life and enjoyment of the cultural heritage, will be open to them.   What are the origins of creativity and how can we develop it\u2014whether within ourselves or in others? Not only does  Playing and Reality  address these questions, it also tackles many more that surround the fundamental issue of the individual self and its relationship with the outside world. In this landmark book of 20th-century psychology, Winnicott shows the listener how, through the attentive nurturing of creativity from the earliest years, every individual has the opportunity to enjoy a rich and rewarding cultural life. Today, as the hothousing and testing of children begins at an ever-younger age, Winnicott's classic text is a more urgent and topical story than ever before.   This text is expertly narrated by a listener favorite, Mike Fraser.   Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont. \u00a91971, 2005 D.W.

In this book, Bronagh Starrs offers an understanding of developmental and therapeutic process from a relational-phenomenological Gestalt perspective. Starrs shows how the adolescent's presenting symptom issues are statements of compromised life space integrity and demonstrates therapeutic sensibility to the adolescent's first-person experience. Throughout the book, the clinician is offered extensive relational and creative strategies to support integrity repair for the adolescent. The developmental impact of various life space contexts are discussed, including parental separation, complex family configuration, grief, adoption, and emerging sexual orientation and gender experience. Therapeutic responses to common creative adjustments are explored including anxiety, school refusal, depression, self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, alcohol and drug use, and sexual trauma.  Adolescent Psychotherapy  will help counsellors and psychotherapists to develop deeper levels of competency in their work as adolescent psychotherapists, as they navigate the complex and fascinating experience of therapy with teenagers. This exceptional contribution is suitable for both experienced practitioners and students of counselling and psychotherapy. "

                "'Know thyself' is said to have been one of the maxims carved into the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. On the face of it, this does not seem like a very difficult task. My self is with me at every moment of every day, I have access to its inner thoughts and feelings, and I am hardly liable to mistake someone else for me. At the same time, however, the self is surprisingly elusive and opaque. Our understanding of the self is replete with puzzles and paradoxes: I cannot be anyone but who I am, and yet everyone will acknowledge that there are circumstances in which being oneself is a difficult task. If I change enough, I can be said to have become a different person. I cannot get away from myself, and yet I can find and lose myself. In this  Very Short Introduction , Marya Schechtman uses insights from philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, and popular thought to consider some of the most compelling and puzzling questions about the self, including questions about what kind of object a self is if it is an object at all, what it means to be oneself and why it is important, what kinds of changes the self can and cannot survive, whether a self can be separated from its body, whether more than one self can exist in a single body, and what role engagement with the environment and with other selves plays in constituting and maintaining the self.

                "From NYU professor of developmental psychology Niobe Way,     an in-depth exploration about what boys and young men teach us about themselves, us, and the toxic culture we have created, one in which we value money over people, toys over human connection, and academic achievement over kindness. Based on her longitudinal and mixed-method research over thirty-five years,  Rebels with a Cause  is a true call to action to change the culture so that we stop the vicious cycle of violence and blame.   \u00a0  Dr. Niobe Way has spent her career researching social and emotional development and finds that boys and young men desperately want and need the same thing as everyone else: close friendships. Yet they and we grow up in a stereotyped \u201cboy\u201d culture, one that devalues and mocks those relationships, rather than recognizing that they\u2019re necessary for human survival.  \u00a0  In  Rebels with a Cause , Way takes her message one step beyond her previous book,  Deep Secrets , which was the inspiration for an Oscar-nominated film  Close,  to reveal how these \u201crebels,\u201d as she calls the boys and young men in her research and in her classrooms, teach us about their and our crisis of connection, evidence of which is visible in our soaring rates of depression, anxiety, loneliness, suicide, and mass violence. They also teach us about the solutions to the crisis, which is to care, to listen with curiosity, and to take individual and collective responsibility for the damage we have done to them, to ourselves, and to the world around us.  \u00a0  Way provides us not only with data-driven insight into the roots and consequences of this crisis of connection, but also offers us concrete and empirically tested strategies for creating a culture that better aligns with our human nature and our human needs. Her book reminds us that \u201cit\u2019s not the rebels who cause the troubles of the world, it\u2019s the troubles that cause the rebels.\u201d The time to listen to and act on what young rebels have been telling us for almost a century is now.

                "After the tremendous success of The Spy Chronicles, A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani participated in a series of conversations on the psychology of war and peace; these have evolved into this fascinating book, written with psychiatrist Neil K. Aggarwal.   Covert takes the reader right into the head of the two spymasters. Delving into their personal and professional trajectories that moulded them in the early years, the conversation traces the extent to which their Indian and Pakistani identities have defined them. Masterfully moderated by Aggarwal, the discussion then turns to the domain of international relations, exploring why the governments of India and Pakistan collaborate in certain areas, but not in others. What emerges is a remarkably forthright, provocatively honest appraisal of the peacebuilding process between the two nations that appear inherently hostile to each other but share so much in terms of history and cultural identity.   The dialogues in Covert reveal a deep camaraderie between Dulat and Durrani, who have headed the intelligence operations for their respective countries. But more importantly perhaps, it provides deep insights into the shadowy world of negotiation and subterfuge. It is an eye-opener and a must-read for anyone invested in peace and amity in South Asia.

You'll learn how to move beyond the unhealthy coping strategies that keep you feeling isolated and lonely, find tips for building a support network and enriching social connections, and develop your own plan for staying on the path to recovery. You'll also find assessments to help you determine the root cause of your OC disorder, exercises for increasing social engagement, and skills for improving social flexibility, trust, and intimacy. Having an eating disorder can make you feel like you're alone. Even if you're in recovery, you may have days when feelings of isolation are too much, and you may feel tempted to fall back into unhealthy patterns. This workbook will help you build your own \"treatment tribe,\" a group of people that help lift you up and support you as you find your way to a full recovery and a rich, meaningful life. "

It introduces the Head, Heart, and Hands Listening model as a vital tool to amplify effective listening in coaching practice. Accessible and applicable, the book explores the three listening modalities of Head, Heart, and Hands as active, though largely unconscious, lenses that inform the potency of our listening. Dakin-Neal argues that once coaches identify \"how\" they listen, they can assist their clients in more targeted ways to positively impact their personal and professional lives. Chapters are divided into the three listening modalities, Head, Heart, and Hands, and are filled with case studies, stories, reflective questions, and exercises from the author's experience to help coaches strengthen their listening skills. The book also includes a comprehensive listening assessment for coaches to use in practice. This book is essential for coaches in practice and in training as well as organizational psychologists, HR professionals, and those working within corporations. "

                "A psychologist\u2019s guide to finding your most fulfilling job yet  When we\u2019re unhappy in our jobs, we often attribute our frustration to a bad manager, boring tasks, and stressful workloads. But our dissatisfaction at work usually stems from a deeper psychological need that\u2019s not being met at work, like not getting the recognition you deserve. In  Job Therapy , Dr. Tessa West helps you figure out the real reason you\u2019re unhappy and shows you how to find a new position in which you\u2019ll thrive, whether in a different role, company, or new industry altogether. Through her research interviewing thousands of people who have recently switched jobs or undergone career changes, she found there are five common sources of career frustration:   having an  identity crisis  \u2013 does your sense of self no longer match your job?  you\u2019ve  drifted-apart  \u2013 do you no longer recognize the job you once loved?   you\u2019re  torn between places  \u2013 are you taking on too many roles at work, switching tasks too often, or stuck between two paths?  you\u2019re  the runner up  \u2013 do you always feel like you keep coming in second?   you\u2019re  the underappreciated star  \u2013 are you crushing it at work, but the people around you aren\u2019t recognizing your performance?   Dr. West will guide you through a working week audit to help identify your unique psychological stressors and use that knowledge to understand what you want your future career to look like. Presenting cutting-edge insights on networking and hiring, from Dr. West\u2019s interviews with over 1,500 professional recruiters,  Job Therapy  will help you land\u00a0your best role yet \u2013 one that guarantees happiness for years to come.  *Includes a downloadable PDF of quizzes from the book.

Many leadership books are either shallow (focusing on only one element of leadership), narrow (examining leadership out of context), or biased (selling an idealized model). This book seeks simplicity without being simplistic and focuses on the listener in their context rather than describing other people's leadership in theirs. It sets out twenty rules for success that draw on Emmanuel Gobillot's twenty years of experience advising high-performing leaders. Each rule is presented in an engaging, instantly recognizable true story that helps current and aspiring leaders to look differently at their own situation. Best described as a leadership development program, this book takes you on a fast-paced, three-step journey from what it takes to be a leader, to why you can be one, via how to succeed. "

                "When social worker Lisa Keefauver became a widow in 2011, she was alarmed to discover that even though 100 percent of us experience loss, we're living in a grief illiterate world. In her work as a therapist and in her search for help in the wake of her own loss, Keefauver began to see how the misguided stories we consume about grief lead to unnecessary suffering. Responding to the problematic narratives that grief is something to move on from after completing the five stages like some sort of to-do list, Keefauver became a grief activist. Through this book and her hit podcast of the same title, she creates a safe place to be inside the messiness of it all, to discover the full spectrum of grief, and to find the tools that help grievers move forward, not on. Grief Is a Sneaky Bitch is a comprehensive guide\u2014serving as both a manual full of insights and skills and more importantly, as a thoughtful companion that helps listeners feel seen and held. Keefauver shares her personal and professional wisdom alongside the lessons she's learned from clinicians, authors, poets, and friends. In place of rigid instructions and must-do checklists, Grief Is a Sneaky Bitch invites reflection, encourages self-compassion, and explores the therapeutic power of humor with, yes, a bit of profanity.

As more of our lives are spent online and in digital spaces, these often overlooked \"Third Places\" play a crucial role in keeping our communities vibrant. In a timely and thoughtful examination, Richard Kyte, PhD, explores the places that nurture our souls and make up the bedrock of our communities. Third Places can range from a neighborhood tavern, to a community center, to a local bookstore or coffee shop. They are the critical gathering spaces where friendships are formed, relationships are nurtured, and the tapestry of community is woven. Yet, for an ever-growing list of reasons, many people today find themselves without a third place of their own. At a time when our nation is facing an epidemic of loneliness, when communities are suffering from loss of trust, low levels of engagement, despair, and political polarization, what if the answer to many of our problems lies in a simple idea? What if we just need to pay attention to the places where we find ourselves?. "

                "Award-winning Fortune 500 brand consultant and behavioral expert Leslie Zane shatters conventional marketing wisdom, showing readers how to tap into the hidden brain where instinct prevails, creating a powerful network of connections that drive people to buy your product, company, or vision.      People don't make decisions with their conscious mind, but on instinct. In  The Power of Instinct , marketing consultant and behavioral science expert Leslie Zane shows that to grow a brand, business, or even a social movement, traditional persuasion tactics fall short. Instead, you must connect to the instinctive mind. And to do this, you need to understand the science of consumer choice and employ techniques that work with a person's brain, not against it.    Zane uncovers the hidden network of connections that dictates the snap decisions we make and cracks the code on how to influence it. With a revolutionary set of rules for expanding the network, Zane shows us how to make any brand, business, political candidate, or idea the dominant instinctive choice. With science as your guide, as well as stories from the world's most successful brands from McDonald's and Lululemon to the Yankees and Taylor Swift, you'll learn:   What kind of messages create the greatest amount of positive associations;    Why finding new customers accelerates growth and relying on existing ones is a trap;    Why emotional stories are not enough to drive trial and long-term brand loyalty.   Whether you're an entrepreneur, Fortune 500 executive, marketing professional, or job seeker, mastering the power of instinct will help supercharge your growth and make whatever you're selling the first choice for any audience.

Exercise. Eat a balanced diet. Go to therapy. Most wellness advice is focused on achieving and maintaining good physical and mental health. But Harvard-trained social scientist and pioneering social health expert Kasley Killam reveals that this approach is missing a vital component: human connection.  Relationships not only make us happier, but also are critical to our overall health and longevity. Research shows that people with a strong sense of belonging are 2.6 times more likely to report good or excellent health. Perhaps even more astonishingly, people who lack social support are up to 53% more likely to die from any cause. Yet social health has been overlooked and underappreciated\u2014until now.  Just as we exercise our physical muscles, we can strengthen our social muscles. Weaving together cutting-edge science, mindset shifts, and practical wisdom, Killam offers the first methodology for how to be socially healthy. An antidote to the loneliness epidemic and an inspiring manifesto for seeing wellbeing as not only physical and mental, but also social, The Art and Science of Connection is a handbook for thriving.  In this essential book, you will:  Learn a simple yet powerful framework to understand, evaluate, and bolster your social health.  Discover the exact strategy or habit you need, as well as research-backed tips, to cultivate and sustain meaningful connection now and throughout your life.  Glean actionable insights to develop a sense of community in your neighborhood, at work, and online from a spirited group of neighbors in Paris, the CEO of a major healthcare company, and an artificially intelligent chatbot.  Get an insider look at the innovative ways that doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs, architects, government leaders, and everyday people are catalyzing a movement toward a more socially healthy society.  The Art and Science of Connection will transform the way you think about each interaction with a friend, family member, coworker, or neighbor, and give you the tools you need to live a more connected and healthy life\u2014whether you are an introvert or extrovert, if you feel stretched thin, and no matter your age or background. Along the way, Killam will reveal how a university student, a newlywed, a working professional, and a retired widow overcame challenges to thrive through connection\u2014and how you can, too.

You\u2019ll laugh out loud at Jia\u2019s crazy social experiments, but you\u2019ll also go away thinking differently about what you can accomplish.\u201d\u2014Chris Guillebeau,  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Happiness Pursuit   \u00a0  Jia Jiang\u2019s TEDx Talk, \u201cWhat I learned from 100 days of rejection,\u201d\u00a0has amassed over ten million views!  Jia Jiang came to the United States with the dream of being the next Bill Gates. But despite early success in the corporate world, his first attempt to pursue his entrepreneurial dream ended in rejection. Jia was crushed and spiraled into a period of deep self-doubt. Jia realized that his fear of rejection was a bigger obstacle than any single rejection would ever be; he needed to find a way to cope with being told \u201cno\u201d that wouldn\u2019t destroy him.\u00a0Inspired by rejection therapy, which uses similar modalities as exposure therapy to desensitize you to the effects of being rejected, he undertook\u00a0the \u201c100 days of rejection\u201d experiment,\u00a0during which he willfully sought out rejection on a daily basis\u2014from requesting a lesson in sales from a car salesman (no) to asking a flight attendant if he could make an announcement on the loud speaker (yes) to his famous request to get Krispy Kreme donuts in the shape of Olympic rings (yes, with a viral video to prove it). \u00a0 Over the course of one hundred rejection attempts, Jia realized that even the most preposterous wish might be granted if you ask the right way. He learned the secrets to making successful requests, tactics for picking the right people to approach at the right time, and strategies for converting an initial no into something positive. More important, Jia discovered ways to steel himself against rejection and live more fearlessly\u2014skills that can\u2019t be derailed by a single setback. The changes Jia experienced from his\u00a0rejection therapy     experiment went far beyond becoming more successful in business; he realized that he could apply these techniques to get more out of his relationships with friends, family, and even casual encounters with strangers. \u00a0 Filled with great stories and valuable insight,  Rejection Proof  shares the secrets of Jia\u2019s rejection journey, distilling each lesson into a strategy that can be used in any negotiation or pitch.

                "Provides a child's-eye perspective on how the culture wars are playing out in our nation's schools  Kids are at the center of today's \"culture wars\"\u2014pundits, politicians, and parents alike are debating which books they should be allowed to read, which version of history they should learn in school, and what decisions they can make about their own bodies. And yet, no one asks kids what they think about these issues.  In Children of a Troubled Time, award-winning sociologist Margaret A. Hagerman amplifies the voices of children who grew up during Trump's presidency and explores how they learn about race in America today. Hagerman interviewed nearly fifty children between the ages of ten to thirteen in two dramatically different political landscapes: Mississippi and Massachusetts. Hagerman interviewed kids who identified as conservative and liberal in both places as well as kids from different racial groups. She discovered remarkably similar patterns in the ideas expressed by these children. Racism, she asserts, is not just a local or regional phenomenon: it is a broad American project affecting childhoods across the country.In Hagerman's emotionally compelling interviews, children describe what it is like to come of age during years of deep political and racial divide, and how being a kid during the Trump era shaped their views on racism, democracy, and America as a whole. Children's racialized emotions are also central to this book: disgust and discomfort, fear and solidarity, dominance and apathy.  As administrators, teachers, and parents struggle to help children make sense of our racially and politically polarized nation, Hagerman offers concrete examples of the kinds of interventions necessary to help kids learn how to become members of a multi-racial democracy and to avoid the development of far-right thinking in the white youth of today. Children of a Troubled Time expands our understanding of how the rising generation grapples with the complexities of racism and raises critical questions about the future of American society. "

In addition, the stigma associated with OCD can make you feel unworthy of receiving the compassion and kindness you need and deserve. You may even experience unwanted intrusive thoughts that result in harsh self-judgment-which can actually hinder your recovery and lead to additional mental health problems. So, how can you break this destructive cycle and start feeling better? The Self-Compassion Workbook for OCD outlines a step-by-step program to help you understand the emotional experience of OCD, and develop the tools you need to manage your disorder and build a better life. Drawing on a powerful combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure and response prevention (ERP), and compassion-focused therapy (CFT), this breakthrough guide will teach you how to balance intense emotions, lean into your fear, and focus on recovery. Over time, you'll learn to replace self-judgment with kindness and self-compassion, so you can stop suffering and start thriving. Living with OCD can be extremely challenging, but it doesn't have to rob you of your self-worth. Let this book be your guide to discovering, supporting, and loving the best you that you can be. "

                "Revolutionize the way you see disruption and change with a groundbreaking alternative to corporate instability from a lauded HR expert.      For decades, \"disruption\" and \"change\" have been seen as essential to business growth and success. In this provocative and incisive book, Ashley Goodall argues that what has become a sacred dogma is both wrong and harmful.    Whether it's a merger or re-org or a new office layout, change has become the ultimate easy button for leaders, who pursue it with abandon, unleashing a torrent of disruption on employees. The result is what he calls \"life in the blender\"\u2014a perpetual cycle of upheaval, uncertainty, and unease.    The problem with change, Goodall argues, is that a culture where everything from people to processes to strategic priorities are constantly in flux exerts a psychological toll that undermines motivation, productivity, and quality. And yet so accustomed are we to constant churn that we have become numb to its very real consequences.    Drawing on two decades spent leading HR organizations at Deloitte and Cisco, Ashley Goodall reveals the truth about human performance and offers a radical new alternative to the constant turbulence that defines corporate life.  The Problem with Change  is a clarion call to leaders everywhere: by prioritizing team cohesion (instead of reshuffling teams at will), using real words (rather than corporate-speak), by sharing secrets (not mission statements), by honoring shared rituals (rather than mandated bonding), by fixing only the things that are truly broken (instead of moving fast and breaking everything in sight), and more, leaders at every level can create the stability that people need to thrive.

ME: I don't know, I'm \u2013 what's the word \u2013 depressed? Do I have to go into detail?   Baek Sehee is a successful young social media director at a publishing house when she begins seeing a psychiatrist about her \u2013 what to call it? \u2013 depression? She feels persistently low, anxious, endlessly self-doubting, but also highly judgemental of others. She hides her feelings well at work and with friends; adept at performing the calmness, even ease, her lifestyle demands. The effort is exhausting, overwhelming, and keeps her from forming deep relationships. This can't be normal.  But if she's so hopeless, why can she always summon a desire for her favourite street food, the hot, spicy rice cake, tteokbokki? Is this just what life is like?  Recording her dialogues with her psychiatrist over a 12-week period, Baek begins to disentangle the feedback loops, knee-jerk reactions and harmful behaviours that keep her locked in a cycle of self-abuse. Part memoir, part self-help book,  I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki  is a book to keep close and to reach for in times of darkness. "

Whether vampire bats sharing blood meals for survival, field crickets remembering champion fighters, macaque monkeys forming grooming pacts after a deadly hurricane, or great tit birds learning the best way to steal milk-it pays to be well connected. In this tour of the animal kingdom, evolutionary biologist Lee Alan Dugatkin reveals a new field of study, uncovering social networks that existed long before the dawn of human social media. He accessibly describes the latest findings from animal behavior, evolution, computer science, psychology, anthropology, genetics, and neurobiology, and incorporates interviews and insights from researchers he finds swimming with manta rays, avoiding pigeon poop, and stopping monkeys from stealing iPads. With Dugatkin as our guide, we investigate social networks in giraffes, elephants, kangaroos, Tasmanian devils, whales, bats, and more. From animal networks in Australia and Asia to Africa, Europe, and the Americas, The Well-Connected Animal is an eye-opening expose of wild friends, enemies, and everything in between. "

Why do our minds sometimes seem to work against us? Psychologists have long attempted to answer these questions, seeking to understand human behavior, feelings, and thoughts. But how to explore something so elusive? In this fascinating history, leading expert Nicky Hayes tells the story of psychology across the centuries and around the world. Hayes introduces key thinkers, including Carl Jung, Anna Freud, Frantz Fanon, and Daniel Kahneman. We see how they tried to expand our understanding, from Pavlov and his dogs to Milgram and his famous electric shock experiments to the CIA's secret mind-control projects. Hayes explores key concepts like child development, the inferiority complex, and PTSD and shows how psychological research has been used for both good and ill. This Little History shines a light on the ever-advancing study of psychology, how the field has evolved over time-and how much more we need to learn. "

If you try making life easier for your loved one, you wind up perpetuating dependency and entitlement. If you push for treatment, you are met with resistance or outright animosity.

Using the skills in this book, you'll learn how your responses to your loved one can worsen and even perpetuate the very problems you are trying to resolve. You'll also discover ways to promote healthy behavior in recovery avoiders, but only after the whole family is emotionally and strategically prepared to follow through successfully. The family well-being approach is based on established principles of behavior change, family interaction research, and more than three decades of clinical experience. If you're feeling caught in a trap with a loved one who won't seek help, this book can help you find your way out, once and for all. "

And what do we do when our boys won\u2019t cooperate with our plans? \u00a0 Whippman digs into the impossibly contradictory pressures boys now face; and the harmful blind spots of male socialization that are leaving boys isolated, emotionally repressed, and adrift.\u00a0Feminist gonzo-style, she\u00a0spends months interviewing incels, reports on a conference for boys accused of sexual assault; crashes at a residential therapy center for young men in Utah, talks to a wide range of psychologists and other experts, and gets boys of all backgrounds to open up about sex, consent, porn, body image, mental health, cancel culture, screens, friendship and loneliness. Along the way, she finds her simple certainties about male privilege seriously challenged. \u00a0\u00a0 With wit, honesty, and a refusal to settle for easy answers,  BoyMom  charts a new path to give boys a healthier, more expansive, and fulfilling story about their own lives.

                "A psychiatrist puts leadership \"on the couch,\" with a provocative exploration of its crucial, often ignored, psychological and personal character foundations.     Elias Aboujaoude's distinctive exploration of leadership provides unusual insight into understanding who should and should not be striving for leadership positions.    Dr Aboujaoude takes on the culture at large, explaining how our cult-like obsession with leadership gives narcissists an edge and results in leadership failure everywhere we look\u2014and how resisting the imperative to rise at all costs can leave many with an inferiority complex.     His takedown of the \"leadership industrial complex,\" an unholy alliance of gurus, coaches, business school professors, and TED-talkers, from Harvard on down, pokes a very sharp elbow into an industry seemingly united in a modern form of alchemy to create leadership gold\u2014a waste of time, money, and effort, since leadership cannot be taught through books or coaching and cannot be bought.    Rather, Dr Aboujaoude vividly illustrates, leaders emerge from a unique combination of personal, psychological, and situational factors that may not be easily controlled. To a large degree, great leaders are born, or happen, with the help of innate temperament, talent, opportunity, circumstances, and timing.     Frank and unflinching, this refreshing take on a classic subject, with its focus on the art of knowing yourself, provides new insight into whether your psychology is aligned with the requirements of effective and happy leadership. The effect is to empower readers to understand themselves and step up if they have what it takes to lead\u2014or find equally rewarding, often superior, ways to achieve fulfillment and leave their mark if they don't.

After a global pandemic that changed why, how, and what people do for a living, many workers find themselves wondering what makes their daily routine worthwhile.  In  Is Your Work Worth It? , two professors \u2013 a philosopher and organizational psychologist \u2013 investigate the purpose of work and its value in our lives.

What kind of mark will your work leave on the world?

                "A viral life coach offers a practical, empathetic, and inspiring guide to breaking people-pleasing patterns that can harm our careers, relationships, physical, and psychic health.  For most of Hailey Magee's life, people-pleasing came so naturally to her that she didn't even have a word for it. When somebody wanted something from her\u2014even a stranger\u2014she gave it, no matter how uncomfortable, exhausted, or resentful she felt inside. People-pleasing, she learned, was a coping mechanism that had kept her physically and emotionally safe in the past, but wreaked havoc on her life in the present\u2014and she was committed to breaking the pattern once and for all.   The solution that social media and self-help shelves gave her was to \" Advocate for yourself! Speak up! Set boundaries !\" But after years of ignoring her feelings and needs, Magee needed more than boundaries; she needed to reconnect with the \"self\" who was supposed to be doing the advocating. You can't express yourself if you're cut off from your feelings. You can't fight for your needs if you don't know what they are. And you can't set boundaries with others until you believe you're worthy of more than the bare minimum. Radically reconnecting with herself gave Magee the confidence and self-respect she needed to stand up for herself in her relationships. As she experienced a freedom she never thought possible, she became a certified life coach with the mission of helping others do the same.    Stop People Pleasing  explains how anyone can break the pattern by learning their own feelings, needs, values, and desires; ending cycles of enmeshment and codependency; overcoming guilt; developing physical and sexual agency; and more. It is a refreshingly nuanced guide, exploring fundamental questions like:  -How can I tell when my genuine kindness veers into people-pleasing?  -How can I set boundaries while maintaining my empathy and generosity?  -When is it appropriate to compromise on my needs, and when is it not?   Combining social science, psychology, and hands-on coaching exercises,  Stop People Pleasing  teaches you how to connect with your own feelings, needs, and dreams; courageously advocate for yourself in your relationships with friends, family, and colleagues; soothe yourself through the growing pains of healing; and dive headfirst into pleasure and play. With fresh insight, heartfelt empathy, and a keen personal understanding of the pitfalls of people-pleasing, Magee helps you say what you need and get what you deserve. "

                "In the bestselling tradition of Charles Duhigg's  The Power of Habit  and Angela Duckworth's  Grit , a renowned social psychologist demonstrates how a subtle turning of habits into rituals can \"clear a little space for everyday magic\" ( The Guardian ) in our lives.  Our lives are filled with repetitive tasks meant to keep us on track\u2014what we come to know as habits. Over time, these routines (like brushing your teeth or putting on your right sock first) tend to be performed automatically. But when we're more mindful about these actions\u2014when we focus on the precise way they are performed\u2014they can instead become rituals. Shifting from a \"habitual\" mindset to a \"ritual\" mindset can convert ordinary acts from black and white to technicolor.   Think about the way you savor a certain beverage, the care you take with a particular outfit that gets worn only on special occasions, the unique way that your family gathers around the table during holidays, or the secret language you enjoy with your significant other. To some, these behaviors may seem quirky, but because rituals matter so deeply to us on a personal level, they give our lives purpose and meaning. Drawing on a decade of original research, Norton shows that rituals play a role in healing communities experiencing a great loss, marking life's major transitions, driving a stadium of sports fans to ecstasy, and helping us rise to challenges and realize opportunities.   Compelling, insightful, and practical,  The Ritual Effect  reminds us of the intention-filled acts that drive human behavior and create sur\u00adprising satisfaction and enjoyment. "

                "Experienced mental health professionals and hosts of the Therapist Uncensored podcast offer a groundbreaking new clinical perspective that integrates modern attachment theory, relational neuroscience, and current cultural context to create a hopeful framework for deeper and more permanent change, growth and connection in all types of relationships.   Secure Relating offers a refreshing and innovative approach to understanding and improving relationships in today's increasingly polarized world. Drawing on over thirty years of professional clinical experience, authors Ann Kelley, PhD and Sue Marriott, LCSW, CGP integrate modern attachment theory, relational neuroscience, and depth psychology into practical tools for deepening self-awareness and navigating closeness with strength in even the most challenging relationships.  Instead of the popular broad attachment categorizations, Secure Relating presents a nuanced understanding of attachment and interpersonal defensive patterns, allowing readers to delve into the complexities of their own experience and apply the specific skills they need.  Refreshingly, Kelley and Marriott make complex concepts accessible and relatable, emphasizing the realistic capacity for neural change and psychological growth. They provide contemporary concepts and interactive tools such as the Modern Attachment Regulation Spectrum, a new framework that helps readers identify their unconscious defensive patterns, update and revise their personal narratives, and cultivate a secure state of mind amid chaos and adversity.   Secure Relating delivers hope, connection, and empowerment amidst the many barriers to emotional closeness and provocations towards self-protection by offering a comprehensive approach to understanding and transforming all kinds of relationships into more secure and satisfying bonds.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

                "A 2024 \"\"NEXT BIG IDEA CLUB\"\" MUST-READ    A profound, humane, and revolutionary new framework for understanding and addressing addiction.    Addiction has been called a moral failing, a social problem, a spiritual crisis, a behavioral disorder, and a brain disease. It has also been called a class issue, a supply problem, a problem of learning, a memory disorder, and a result of trauma. And some propose that addiction is neither a disease nor a problem, but a transgressive expression of freedom, a maligned sub-culture, a therapeutic relationship. Even the term 'addiction' is open to question. There are few human phenomena so elusive and intractable; after decades of neuroscientific research, we aren't much closer to understanding addiction, nor to addressing it effectively.   This profusion of interpretations, meanings, and models reflects a hidden truth about addiction: that it is profusely generative of meaning itself. In this bold reimagining, pioneering psychiatrist Elias Dakwar examines addiction as a sustained creative act\u2014and specifically as a process of personal world-building, complete with its own rituals, systems of value, modes of suffering, and sources of support. In this regard, addiction is something we all do. But there is a crucial difference. In the case of those of us suffering from addiction explicitly, this meaningful world keeps us in clear captivity, worsening the suffering and confusion we hoped it would console. And we remain stuck because we have trouble imagining it differently.  Drawing on vivid stories of his own patients, path-breaking research with meditation, psychotherapy, and psychedelics/hallucinogens, and decades of clinical experience, Dakwar explores this captivity at the heart of our addictions, and shows how we might move beyond its bounds to reclaim our freedom. He also relates addiction to our collective self-inflicted crises, from environmental destruction to militarism to social injustice, rendering this often stigmatized condition relevant to all of us. With fluid, rich, and often startling prose, The Captive Imagination offers a novel path for better understanding and overcoming addiction, as well as human suffering more generally. "

Further, the mental health field has only recently begun moving away from \"treating autism\" to working with autistic and neurodivergent individuals in a more affirming way. That's why Dr. Amy Marschall created A Clinician's Guide to Supporting Autistic Clients. As an expert psychologist and a member of the autism community herself, she recognized the need to move away from treatments that pathologize differences and toward a neurodiversity-affirming approach that meets clients where they are. Inside, you'll find over 100 affirming tips, tools, and interventions that will allow you to: - Honor the language preferences, goals, and priorities of the autistic community - Create a foundation for assessment and treatment that best supports autistic clients - Correct unintentional harms cause by historical \"best practices\" in autism treatment Neurodiversity-affirming care is not a set of specific behaviors or interventions but an underlying philosophy of honoring each client's needs every day.

Tamblyn Watts outfits listeners with twenty-seven prompts and roadmaps for informed, honest conversations with their aging parent-or family members, health care providers, and other professionals. She covers questions like: Does my parent need help around the house? What kind of medical issues should we look out for? Do I really need to help my parent if they're toxic? How can my family share the caregiving load? How to have the discussion is just as important as what needs to be discussed, so each chapter has tips for navigating complicated emotions and reaching an agreement when everyone has different ideas. Listeners will get informed, have a productive conversation, and make a plan-then focus on making the most of their time with their aging relative. "

When, as a graduate student, Alex Kriss first began working as a therapist in the field, his supervisors warned him that borderline patients were manipulative, difficult, and had a tendancy to drop out of treatment. Yet, years later, when Kriss was establishing his private practice and a borderline patient known as Ana came to his office, he felt compelled to try to help her, despite all of the warnings he\u2019d heard.  Borderline  is the story of his work with Ana\u2014how his successes with her led him to open his doors to other BPD patients and advocate for them.  Borderline  is also the story of the disorder itself: Kriss traces accounts of the condition going back to antiquity, showing how this disease has been known by many names over the millennia, most of them gendered: possession, hysteria, witchcraft, moral insanity. All referred to a person\u2014usually a woman\u2014whose behavior and personality were seen as fractured, unstable, unpredictable, and uncontrollable. Kriss guides us through this history up through the emergence of psychotherapy, the development of the modern diagnosis, and attitudes toward treatment today. "

                "A rare study that transforms our understanding of why youth die by suicide, why youth suicide clusters happen, and how to stop them In Life under Pressure, Anna S. Mueller and Seth Abrutyn investigate the social roots of youth suicide and why certain places weather disproportionate incidents of adolescent suicides and suicide clusters. Through close examination of kids' lives in a community repeatedly rocked by youth suicide clusters, Mueller and Abrutyn reveal how the social worlds that youth inhabit and the various messages they learn in those spaces-about who they are supposed to be, mental illness, and help-seeking-shape their feelings about themselves and in turn their risk of suicide. With great empathy, Mueller and Abrutyn also identify the moments when adults unintentionally fail kids by not talking to them about suicide, teaching them how to seek help, or helping them grieve. Through stories of survival, resilience, and even rebellion, Mueller and Abrutyn show how social environments can cause suicide and how they can be changed to help kids discover a life worth living. By revealing what it is like to live and die in one community, Life under Pressure offers tangible solutions to one of the twenty-first century's most tragic public health problems. "

                "An unflinching, rare account of living with severe mental illness that is also a bold commentary on how we misunderstand this often debilitating disease.   The Complications is an intimate portrait of what it's like to live with schizoaffective disorder of the bipolar type as well as a biting, revelatory critique of America's mental health culture. Emmett Rensin has written and edited articles for major national media outlets, and taught writing and literature at prestigious schools. But he has also lost jobs and friends, been hospitalized and institutionalized, and cycled through a daunting combination of medications. With scorching honesty, he reflects on his messy, fragile attempt to live his life, his periods of grace, and his near misses with disaster and death.  Going beyond the usual peans against \"stigma\" and for \"understanding\", Rensin confronts the dysfunction in current mental health narratives, contrasting what he calls mental illness \"high culture\"\u2014in which we affirm the prevalence of anxiety and encourage regular therapy, insisting that the \"mentally ill\" aren't dangerous or even weird\u2014with even progressive society's inability to contend with people with more severe forms of mental illness: those people we pass on the street talking to themselves, those caught in a loop between hospitals and prisons, or even those who we cannot tolerate in our own schools, offices, and lives, including himself.   With raw honesty, Rensin invites us into every aspect of his life, from what it's like see four different psychiatrists in one year and the nature of psychotic breaks to a harrowing diary that logs exactly what happens when he stops taking his medication and the unexpected kinship he discovers with an incarcerated spree killer with schizophrenia. Going beyond pure memoir, he reflects on the uncertain \"science\" of diagnosis, the nature of art about and by the insane, political activism, and the history of madness, from the asylum to the academy.   A compelling, often devastating, blend of memoir, cultural commentary, and history, The Complications elevates the conversation around mental illness and challenges us to reexamine what we think we know about what is to go insane.

Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy (DDP) is an attachment-focused treatment for children and adolescents who have experienced abuse and neglect and are now living in stable foster and adoptive families. Here, Daniel Hughes and Kim S. Golding provide a practical accompaniment to their highly successful DDP text coauthored with Julie Hudson, Healing Relational Trauma with Attachment-Focused Interventions. In this book, practitioners are invited to reflect on their experience of implementing the DDP model through discussion, examples, and reflection prompts. Listeners are encouraged to consider the diversity of both practitioners and those receiving DDP interventions, and how each unique individual's identity can be embraced within the application of DDP interventions. DDP can be practiced as a therapy, a parenting approach, and as a practice approach for those working within healthcare, social care, or education, and this book is an invaluable resource for listeners who fall into any one of these roles.

                "Profiles in Mental Health Courage  portrays the dramatic journeys of a diverse group of Americans who have struggled with their mental health. This book offers deeply compelling stories about the bravery and resilience of those living with a variety of mental illnesses and addictions.        Several years ago, Patrick J. Kennedy shared the story of his personal and family challenges with mental illness and addiction\u2014and the nation\u2019s\u2014in his bestselling memoir,  A Common Struggle . Now, he and his  Common Struggle  coauthor, award-winning healthcare journalist Stephen Fried, have crafted this powerful new book sharing the untold stories of others\u2014a special group who agreed to talk about their illnesses, treatments, and struggles for the first time.        When Kennedy\u2019s uncle, President John F. Kennedy, published his classic book  Profiles in Courage , he hoped to inspire \u201cpolitical courage\u201d by telling the stories of brave U.S. senators who changed America.\u00a0   \u00a0  In  Profiles in Mental Health Courage , former Congressman Kennedy adapts his uncle\u2019s idea to inspire the \u201cmental health courage\u201d it takes for those with these conditions to treat their illnesses, and risk telling their stories to help America face its crisis in our families, our workplaces, our jails, and on our streets. The resounding silence surrounding these illnesses remains persistent, and this book takes an unflinching look at the experience of mental illness and addiction that inspires profound connection, empathy, and action.  \u00a0  In this book, you\u2019ll meet people of all ages, backgrounds, and futures, across politics and government, Hollywood and the arts, tech and business, sports and science\u2014some recovering, some relapsing, some just barely holding on, but all sharing experiences and insights we need to better understand. You\u2019ll also meet those trying to help them through\u2014parents, siblings, spouses, therapists, bosses, doctors, and friends who create the extended families needed to support care and wellness.   \u00a0  The personal stories they share with Kennedy and Fried are intimate, sometimes shocking, always revealing. And they are essential reading for caregivers, family members, policymakers, and the general public\u2014just as they are for those who often feel alone in experiencing these challenges themselves. "

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, a disturbing social media trend emerged: a large number of yoga instructors and alt-health influencers were posting stories about a secretive global cabal bent on controlling the world's population with a genocidal vaccine. Instagram feeds that had been serving up green smoothie recipes and Mary Oliver poems became firehoses of Fox News links, memes from 4chan, and prophecies of global transformation.  Since May 2020, Derek Beres, Matthew Remski and Julian Walker have used their  Conspirituality  podcast to expose countless facets of the intersection of alt-health practitioners with far-right conspiracy trolls. Now this expansive and revelatory book unpacks the follies, frauds, cons and cults that dominate the New Age and wellness spheres and betray the trust of people who seek genuine relief in this uncertain age.  With analytical rigor and irreverent humor,  Conspirituality  offers an antidote to our times, helping readers recognize wellness grifts, engage with loved ones who've fallen under the influence, and counter lies and distortions with insight and empathy.

                "Stanford-trained psychiatrist David Carreon, MD, reveals what it takes to move from nagging disappointment, dissatisfaction, or depression to a life of thriving. One of the pioneers of the use of an intense form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in severely depressed patients, Dr. Carreon was astonished by how quickly and dramatically most of them recovered. But he also saw very clearly that just eliminating the symptoms of depression wasn't enough. To live a truly fulfilling life, his patients needed to leave old habits behind and embrace the patterns of flourishing. In The Opposite of Depression, he draws on insights from his clinical experience, the latest research, and his Christian faith to point listeners to principles and practices that promote thriving in mind, body, and soul. Each chapter offers practical steps listeners can take to start moving in the direction of greater satisfaction, fulfillment, and purpose. "

                "The acclaimed  New York Times  bestselling memoir of the author's struggle to understand her own sociopathy and shed light on the often maligned and misunderstood mental disorder.      \"A cross between a podcast by relationship therapist Esther Perel and a salacious tell-all.\"    \u2014San Francisco Chronicle   Patric Gagne realized she made others uncomfortable before she started kindergarten. Something about her caused people to react in a way she didn't understand. She suspected it was because she didn't feel things the way other kids did. Emotions like fear, guilt, and empathy eluded her. For the most part, she felt nothing. And she didn't like the way that \"nothing\" felt. She did her best to pretend she was like everyone else, but the constant pressure to conform to a society she knew rejected anyone like her was unbearable. So Patric stole. She lied. She was occasionally violent. She became an expert lock-picker and home-invader. All with the goal of replacing the nothingness with...something. In college, Patric finally confirmed what she'd long suspected. She was a sociopath. But even though it was the very first personality disorder identified\u2014well over 200 years ago\u2014sociopathy had been neglected by mental health professionals for decades. She was told there was no treatment, no hope for a normal life. She found herself haunted by sociopaths in pop culture, madmen and evil villains who are considered monsters. Her future looked grim. But when Patric   reconnects with an old flame, she gets a glimpse of a future beyond her diagnosis. If she's capable of love, it must mean that she isn't a monster. With the help of her sweetheart (and some curious characters she meets along the way) she embarks on a mission to prove that the millions of Americans who share her diagnosis aren't all monsters either. This is the inspiring story of her journey to change her fate and how she managed to build a life full of love and hope. "

In his role as Founder and CEO of the world's only Happiness Research Institute, he has travelled the globe interviewing the world's happiest people to discover the key components of happiness. In  The Key to Happiness , Meik explores the hidden treasures which can improve your happiness, and divides them into the six building blocks of happiness; togetherness, money, health, kindness, trust and freedom. For each happiness block he offers practical tips: for togetherness he encourages setting up a mini-library in your apartment building or starting a tool-sharing programme in your street; for kindness he suggests leaving a surprise gift on a stranger's doorstep, helping a tourist find their way or telling someone who means a lot to you that they do. Drawing on social science, case studies and Meik's original research, this practical guide shows us that you can find happiness in a simple way of life. While Meik has travelled across the glove to discover the secrets of the world's happiest people, this book shows us that you can be just as happy where you are.

For Western Europe it marked the beginning of decades of unprecedented cooperation and prosperity that one historian has labeled \"the long peace.\" Yet half a world away, in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, and Malaya-the fighting never really stopped, as these regions sought to completely sever the yoke of imperialism and colonialism with all-too-violent consequences. East and Southeast Asia quickly became the most turbulent regions of the globe. Within weeks of the famous surrender ceremony aboard the USS Missouri, civil war, communal clashes, and insurgency engulfed the continent, from Southeast Asia to the Soviet border. By early 1947, full-scale wars were raging in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Within a decade after the Japanese surrender, almost all of the countries of South, East, and Southeast Asia that had formerly been conquests of the Japanese or colonies of the European powers experienced wars and upheavals that resulted in the deaths of at least 2.5 million combatants and millions of civilians. With A Continent Erupts, acclaimed military historian Ronald H. Spector draws on letters, diaries, and international archives to provide a comprehensive military history and analysis of these little-known but decisive events. "
