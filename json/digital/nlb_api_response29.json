Islamic institutions of higher education are critical to understanding the Indonesian Islamic community both for the ways in which they define orthodoxy and act as culture brokers to the wider Islamic community, as well for their cultural brokerage with Western philosophy and scholarship. Not only are the institutions and their faculty and staff important participants in the discourse about the future, they are subjects of it as well. The changes these institutions are undergoing and the questions such changes generate provide a window into the future of Indonesia as it is being created\"-- Provided by publisher. "

In a career spanning four decades, S. Gopinathan is considered by many to be a pillar of teacher education in Singapore. He has played a key role in the establishment and transformation of Singapore's education system, pioneering many programmes and advising on policy both nationally and internationally. In the process, he has contributed over 25 books (authored, co-authored and edited) and 115 articles and book chapters to the field, and continues to inspire and empower younger colleagues in the region to challenge the cause for excellence in education and education reform. In Education and the Nation State, S. Gopinathan brings together 14 of his key writings in one volume. Starting with a specially written introduction, which gives an overview of Gopinathan's career and contextualises his selection, the essays are then arranged thematically, providing an overview not just of his own career, but also reflecting the development and key concerns of education in the nation state that is Singapore\"-- Provided by publisher.

The book demonstrates how the state maintained its hegemony and legitimacy through the culture of crisis management through education. It is essentially the history of how Singapore's developmental state managed crises (imagined, real or engineered), and how changes in history, civics and social studies curricula, served to legitimize the state, through educating and moulding the desired 'good citizen' in the interest of nation building. Underpinning these changes has been the state's use of cultural constructs such as Confucianism and Asian values to shore up its legitimacy\"-- Provided by publisher. "

In a career spanning four decades, S. Gopinathan is considered by many to be a pillar of teacher education in Singapore. He has played a key role in the establishment and transformation of Singapore's education system, pioneering many programmes and advising on policy both nationally and internationally. In the process, he has contributed over 25 books (authored, co-authored and edited) and 115 articles and book chapters to the field, and continues to inspire and empower younger colleagues in the region to challenge the cause for excellence in education and education reform. In Education and the Nation State, S. Gopinathan brings together 14 of his key writings in one volume. Starting with a specially written introduction, which gives an overview of Gopinathan's career and contextualises his selection, the essays are then arranged thematically, providing an overview not just of his own career, but also reflecting the development and key concerns of education in the nation state that is Singapore\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "The first book to explore the development of Singapore's much-talked-about education and examination system, this volume juxtaposes examinations with its immediate context of education and wider context of politics, economy and society. The study covers three broad historical periods: Examinations in Singapore from 1891 to 1945; The Post-War Years from 1946 to the 1970s; and Charting Our Destiny from the 1980s to 2007. In the British period up to 1941, the local examinations were conducted by the vernacular schools, and external examinations by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate. There was a lack of systematic effort to establish a uniform system of education and examinations. During the Japanese Occupation, examinations were conducted by the Japanese authorities and, unexpectedly, the Cambridge examinations continued in the Sime Road Camp. In the post-war period and particularly after Singapore was granted self-government, the establishment of a national education system was followed by the emergence of national examinations: the Primary School Leaving Examinations and the Singapore-Cambridge GCE N/O/A Levels for every school-going child in Singapore. Thereafter, the nature of national examinations evolved with the changing needs of education and the nation. At the turn of the century, with the Ministry of Education's decision to take greater control of examinations, the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board was established, to oversee new developments in examinations. Unlike most literature on education where examinations are often mentioned as an outcome of educational goals and objectives, this book focuses on examinations per se. Examinations have gained a momentum of their own, and it is interesting to note the development of examinations against the backdrop of the broader history of Singapore and of education in Singapore.

At the centre of the volume are findings from a four-year critical ethnographic case study of a Canadian high school with a large number of immigrant students from Hong Kong and descriptions of the multitude of ways teachers and students thought about, responded to, and negotiated the issues and dilemmas that arose. The solutions and insights they derived from their experiences of working across linguistic, cultural and racial differences should be valuable to educators in other locales that have become home to large numbers of immigrant families. The text is designed to help readers think about how the issues and dilemmas in the case study manifest themselves in their own communities and how to apply the insights they gain to their own teaching and learning contexts. Each chapter includes four components: an excerpt from the ethnographic study; an analytic commentary on the ethnographic text drawn from a variety of theoretical perspectives and academic disciplines (including interactionist socio-linguistics, language minority education.

                "The late Mr Lee Kuan Yew (1923--2015) laid the foundations for the creation of a first-world education system in Singapore. Like many other issues concerning the country, his ideas for education were transported in a red box, which he took with him wherever he went, even up to his last days. Inside it was always something designed to help create a better life for all Singaporeans. The editors of this volume were inspired by the idea of Mr Lee's red box and by the Founding Father's selfless drive to continuously improve the country he loved. As such, the book explores in detail Mr Lee's plans, including chapters on Education: The Man and His Ideas; Foundational Pillars of Singapore's Education; Education for Nationhood and Nation-Building; and 21st Century Readiness and Adaptability. The chapters also include the authors' visions, no matter how great or small, for the future of education in Singapore. They explore how Mr Lee's educational policies resulted in a system that attracts the right and best candidates to become teachers; that forms them into effective teachers, specialists and leaders; that ensures they and the education system are able to deliver the best possible learning for every child; and that establishes a legacy that has allowed the education system to continue to move forward while tackling the challenges of its success. From the little red box came the ideas that led to the country's meteoric rise. Likewise, the editors hope this book will lead to a brighter future in education. "

It addresses both the concepts and practical application of project-based learning to enhance teaching and learning. It describes empirical case study research into the impact of research-based project work on independent learning for academically-able secondary school students at Hwa Chong Institution, a premier independent school in Singapore. The research investigated how students dealt with an innovative project-based learning curriculum built on a social constructivist approach designed to foster independent learning attitudes. The students had to research and initiate their own projects, and see through the entire process with guidance from their teacher mentors. The case study findings give rich insights into student perspectives and experiences as they engage in projects and respond to real-life challenges and problems. A new theory of project-based learning is presented in the form of theoretical propositions. The research has implications for the professional development of teachers as project work mentors to help prepare their students to be 'future-proof' in dealing with 21st century study, work and social challenges with confidence. The book highlights compelling reasons for schools to include some form of research-based project work within their curricula, thereby allowing students to engage in collaborative, authentic research.

Religion in the Schools examines the many facets of this complex subject, including prayer in the schools, the teaching of evolution, and other issues that continue to generate controversy. It provides a broad overview of the subject, as well as a detailed examination of the underpinnings of the legal and societal wall between church and state.

In their exile, Will and Mary encounter Hosteen Tse, a great Navajo leader and fount of tribal lore who pleads for aid for his starving people. Will and Mary do what they can to help, which is little in a time when banks are failing and old friends are turning to theft.\"--BOOK JACKET. \"Just when things look darkest, Roosevelt and his New Deal programs bring both hope and new tensions. Will is drawn into a conflict when Joe Garlen, a skilled mechanic who antagonizes everyone, seduces the niece of Franklin Begay. Franklin, Will's Navajo assistant and only close friend, seeks revenge, and he makes Will an unwitting accomplice. And the troubles keep mounting, as one teacher barricades herself in her cottage out of fear of the Navajos, and a talented young athlete known as \"the Navajo Jim Thorpe\" sees his dreams of a career in professional baseball tragically shattered by Jim Crow laws.\"--Jacket.

Leslie Mass captures the heart and the attention of the reader with her story of Pakistanis in 1962 and those of a new generation who are engaged in building a sustainable educational system for their country's forgotten children.

She found herself in a remote village in Pakistan, 21 years old, and fresh from college graduation, with the only directive to \"find something to do\" in a Muslim village with no other Peace Corps volunteers, no other Westerners, no program, and scarce resources. Coming face to face with her naivete\u0301 youthful arrogance, and inexperience, she muddles her way through her first year of service, moves on to a larger city with other volunteers, then returns home to pursue a career as an educator. Forty-seven years later, she returns to Pakistan--a much changed woman to a much changed country. She intersperses the current-day tale with the journal entries from 1962, thereby providing a colorful and poignant comparison between a country in its infancy and a country in transition, and the woman of 21 with the woman of 68\"--Provided by publisher.

Caught between conflicting imperatives, of spiralling demand, and limited resources, the balance between public and private higher education systems in South East, South, and East Asia has shifted markedly. Twenty years ago, no private universities existed in Malaysia, or Viet Nam - now private higher education is challenging for a major role. But this is not the whole story. The same cost pressures affect public HEIs. Governments press for more enrolments, but state support is slipping, at least in per-student terms. The effects push public HEIs to diversify income sources, by various means: offering high demand courses for high fees, or developing parallel courses, taught at nights or weekends, sometimes in shopping malls, for high fees. Is there a connection between the two trends? What is argued is that we are witnessing not merely a changing balance between public and private sectors, but a blurring of borders between them, with public HEIs now often behaving more like private, for-profit institutions. The book charts and illustrates these trends, posing questions about their meaning, including issues of transparency, equity, and what the reforms might mean for traditional conceptions of public good in higher education\"-- Provided by publisher.
