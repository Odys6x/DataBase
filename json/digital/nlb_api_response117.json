In an original and persuasive study, Bert Bender demonstrates that it is this treatise, rather than any of Darwin's earlier works, that provoked the most immediate and vigorous response from American fiction writers. ",
                "These authors embraced and incorporated Darwin's theories, insights, and language, creating an increasingly dark and violent view of sexual love in American realist literature. In The Descent of Love, Bender carefully rereads the works of William Dean Howells, Henry James, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Sarah Orne Jewett, Kate Chopin, Harold Frederic, Charles W. Chesnutt, Edith Wharton, and Ernest Hemingway, teasing from them a startling but utterly convincing preoccupation with questions of sexual selection. Competing for readership as novelists who best grasped the \"real\" nature of human love, these writers also participated in a heated social debate over racial and sexual differences and the nature of sex itself. Influenced more by The Descent of Man than by the Origin of Species, Bender's novelists built upon Darwin's anthropological and zoological materials to anatomize their characters' courtship behavior, returning consistently to concerns with physical beauty, natural dominance, and the power to select a mate.

                "Susan Strehle argues that a new fiction has developed from the influence of modern physics. The changed physical world appears in both content and form in some of the most ambitious recent fiction, which Strehle names \"actualism\" after the observations of Werner Heisenberg. Within that framework she explores the meditations on actuality in Pynchon, Coover, Gaddis, Barth, Atwood, and Barthelme. Although important recent narratives diverge markedly from realistic practice, this book claims that they do so in order to reflect more acutely on what we now understand as real. According to Strehle, the actualists balance attention to questions of art with an engaged meditation on the external, actual world. Reality is no longer realistic; in the new physical or quantum universe, it is discontinuous, energetic, relative, statistical, subjectively seen, and uncertainly known--all terms taken from the new physics. Actualist fiction is characterized by incompletions, indeterminacy, and \"open\" endings unsatisfying to the readerly wish for fulfilled promises and completed patterns. Gravity's Rainbow, for example, ends not with a period but with a dash. Realistic novels typically construct solid, believable, particularized environments, but actualist texts combine the plausible and the strange. Thus a recognizable campus like Berkeley or Cornell has a suburb called San Narciso or Zembla. Strehle makes the point that these innovations in narrative form reflect in allied ways upon twentieth-century history, politics, and science. Arguing that the perception of a changed reality reaches into philosophy, psychology, literary theory, and other areas of inquiry, the book advances a pluralistic view of the meaning of contemporary fiction. A final chapter extends the discussion beyond the North American borders to African, South American, and European texts, suggesting a global community of writers whose fiction belongs in the quantum universe.

A world-famous builder of automated clocks, Gruber has reached the pinnacle of his art in Ernst--a man constructed entirely of clockwork. Educated and raised in the Gruber household to be a gentle, caring soul, Ernst begins to discover a profound love for his master's daughter, Giselle. Just as their relationship becomes intimate, however, tragedy strikes and the family falls apart. Ernst's serene and happy existence is shattered and changed forever. Abandoned, knowing no other life but the one he has led, Ernst allows himself to wind down in a kind of suicide. Over one hundred years later, he awakens in a strange new land, the world he's known long gone. Along with his mentor and guide, a well-meaning if slightly unstable homeless man, Ernst attempts to piece together the events that brought him to his new home--and to let go of the century-old tragedy that still haunts him.\"--P.

In the aftermath of the most daring military coup in history, the surviving population is crammed inside giant Citadels, watched over by an army of cloned soldiers. The hope of a nation lies in a tiny number of freedom fighters hidden in the abandoned countryside \u2013 most of whom are teenagers who escaped the attack on their special school.  Seen by many as no more than misfits and 'problem children', this band of fighters could never have imagined the responsibility that now rests on their shoulders. But perhaps this war needs a different kind of hero. After a lifetime of being defined by their weaknesses, the teenagers must learn how to play to their strengths, and become the best they can be in a world that has never been on their side. "

                "No matter how hard she tries, Ashton cannot keep her head down. Not after Sheva is dragged off a train in front of her.   Augland 54 is the Pacific Northwest's most extravagant theme park. Those with Suits choose the body they want and live the life of their dreams...and those without Suits work for the Artificial Existence Center, or AEC. As long as the workers keep their heads down, Augland provides food and shelter from the post-war world outside its domed walls.  When Ashton is sent to the new Land of Legends park, she discovers that Augland is keeping secrets\u2014inside and outside of its walls\u2014and they're more violent than she ever expected. So she decides to fight back. After all, if Augland is going to make her dress up as a red-headed warrior princess, then she's more than willing to become one.  In a corporation-ruled world inhabited by the augmented bodies of the wealthy, securely cut off from the rest in life-extending pods, Ashton exposes the sham of corporate success and refuses to remain a cog in the machine. The only thing that matters now is freedom. "

At least that's what Ashton thinks until Wolfe leads an attack at the Colony and kidnaps Jagatha.   Heartbroken and once again defeated by Augland, Ashton is forced to decide whether to accept the loss and keep her freedom, or fight against the tyranny of the Suits, even if it means going back into the dome of the Augland park she fought so hard to escape.  Ashton soon discovers that the levels of Augland 54's treachery go far deeper than she ever imagined and the only way to fight it is to become another version of herself. But even with the fa\u00e7ade, Ashton is afraid she is unsuitable to lead the rebellion. Can the workers, exhausted and unprotected, rise up against the augmented and idealized world of the Suits? All Ashton knows is that she refuses to lose anyone else. It's time for the rise of the  UnSuited . "

[A] strong and intricate story.\" \u2014 Kirkus Reviews   This 2022 Colorado Book Award Winner is a rare, searing portrayal of the future of climate change in South Asia. A streetrat turned revolutionary and the disillusioned hacker son of a politician try to take down a ruthlessly technocratic government that sacrifices its poorest citizens to build its utopia.   The South Asian Province is split in two. Uplanders live in a luxurious, climate-controlled biodome, healthy and artificially youthful forever. Outside, the poor and forgotten scrape by with black-market robotics, in slums threatened by rising sea levels, unbreathable air, and deadly superbugs.  Ashiva works for the Red Hand, an underground network of revolutionaries fighting the government, which is run by a merciless computer algorithm. As a smuggler with the best robotic arm and cybernetic enhancements the slums can offer, her cargo includes the city's most vulnerable abandoned children.  When the brilliant Uplander hacker Riz-Ali stumbles into the Red Hand's dangerous activities, he and Ashiva uncover a horrifying conspiracy that the government will do anything to bury. As armed guardians kidnap children, massive robots flatten the slums, and a pandemic threatens to decimate the city, Ashiva and Riz must put aside their differences to fight the system and save the communities they love.

                "In this electric speculative YA sci/fi novel, the world treats memories like currency, so dreams can be a complicated business. Perfect for fans of Neal Stephenson and Philip K. Dick.   In an alternative 1987, a disease ravages human memories. There is no cure, only artificial recall. The lucky ones\u2014the recollectors\u2014need the treatment only once a day.  Freya Izquierdo isn't lucky. The high school senior is a \"degen\" who needs artificial recall several times a day. Plagued by blinding half-memories that take her to her knees, she's desperate to remember everything that will help her investigate her father's violent death. When her sleuthing almost lands her in jail, a shadowy school dean selects her to attend his Foxtail Academy, where five hundred students will trial a new tech said to make artificial recall obsolete.  She's the only degen on campus. Why was she chosen? Freya is nothing like the other students, not even her new friends Ollie, Chase, and the alluring Fletcher Cohen. Definitely not at all like the students who start to vanish, one by one. And nothing like the mysterious Dean Mendelsohn, who has a bunker deep in the woods behind the school.  Nothing can prepare Freya and her friends for the truth of what that bunker holds. And what kind of memories she'll have to access to survive it.   \"Vaca's debut is a thrilling and often unsettling examination of the elusive nature of memory and truth. The Memory Index will leave you breathlessly turning pages until its satisfying conclusion.\"  \u2014Jonathan Evison, New York Times bestselling author of Small World  Get hooked on The Memory Index Duology:  Book 1: The Memory Index  Book 2: The Recall Paradox (coming Spring 2023) "

The only human among a sea of clones. It's been hundreds of years since humanity died off in the slow plague, leaving the clones behind to carry on human existence. Over time they've perfected their genes, moving further away from the imperfections of humanity. But if they really are perfect, why did they create Jack?  While Jack longs for acceptance, Althea-310 struggles with the feeling that she's different from her sisters. Her fascination with Jack doesn't help. As Althea and Jack's connection grows stronger, so does the threat to their lives. What will happen if they do the unthinkable and fall in love?  \"Like the works of Ursula K. LeGuin, inside this lyrically written, suspenseful tale is a deeply humane thematic core.\" \u2014Kirkus Reviews , starred Review  \"We fell for Jack and Althea's romance, which is made to order for fans of  The Giver ,  Delirium  and  Warm Bodies , because woven into this fast-paced and romantic sci-fi is a thoughtful look at what it really means to be human.\" \u2014Justine Magazine     \"A thought-provoking tale that explores conformity, individuality, and what it means to be human...With imaginative, vivid world building, this should appeal to fans of Lauren Oliver's  Replica .\" \u2014Booklist   \"Readers will feel fully immersed in this new reality.

                "\u2018The truth is out there, Mulder, but so are the lies.\u2019    For the first time, despite alien abductions and FBI attempts at infiltration, the TRUTH about each programme in the three series of The X-Files is now revealed.    MiXtakes of every shape and form: continuity errors, logical inconsistencies, subject matter, plot discrepancies, recurring actors, family scorecards and best lines.    Covers the original two series.    This book is not designed as a criticism  of the brilliant television show The X-Files, its crew, actors and anyone else involved in the process of making it. If there is any criticism, it is meant in a  constructive way. The last thing I\u2019d want is to upset the people who put together these great stories in a matter of days.    Okay, so far, the most innovative show on television has seventy-three episodes of non-stop quality under its  belt and it\u2019s about time we started paying attention, real attention. It\u2019s time to get out the video collection of  episodes one through seventy-three and watch those episodes for the scenes where Scully\u2019s hair is miraculously  changed by unknown beings or when Mulder\u2019s computer goes missing, with nothing but a keyboard left to show it  existed.    The nit-picks in this book follow a fairly basic pattern - they point out mistakes. Yes, I said mistakes. Although  it is hard to believe that such an amazing show could be flawed, there is always the problem that little things  can slip past the intelligent people that produce it and this is what this guide does (well it points out the mistakes, it doesn\u2019t create them). The nit\u2019s however, very rarely attack the basis of an episode, as all the plot lines in The X-Files always seem to fit together nicely. The nit\u2019s point out the humorous things, the bloopers and the great moments.    Each entry in this guide has at least five sections out of seven. The sections are the following: Episode Production  Number and Title, Summary, and Episode Nit-Picks, followed by Recurring Actors, Best Line, Scenes, and Title Explanation. "

                "He'd had so many names over the centuries, so many new identities that he could scarcely remember who he had originally been. Now his name was Daetrin, a name given by the alien conquerors of humankind, the Tyr.    Three hundred years had passed since the Tyr conquered the people of Earth as they had previously overcome numerous races throughout the galaxy. In their victory they had taken the very heart out of the human race, isolating the true individualists, the geniuses, all the people who represented the hopes, dreams, and discoveries of the future, and imprisoning them in dome colonies on planets hostile to human life. There the Tyr, a race which shared a unified gestalt mind, had left these gifted individuals to work on projects which would, the conquerors hoped, reveal all of humankind's secrets to them.    Yet Daetrin's secret was one no scientist had even uncovered, for down through the years he had succeeded in burying it so well that he had even hidden his real nature from himself. But, taken into custody by the Tyr, there was no longer any place for Daetrin to run, no new name and life for him to assume. Now he would at last be forced to confront the truth about himself-and if he failed, not just Daetrin but all humans would pay the price... "

THE STING-Washington, DC Police Detective Gideon Malcolm had been given a tip about the stolen Daedalus supercomputer. Yet no one was willing to give him the backup he needed to check it out. So Gideon turned to the one person he knew he could count on, his brother, FBI Agent Raphael Malcolm. Together they set up their stakeout. When no one showed, they went in to check out the seemingly abandoned warehouse-and stumbled into the midst of a deadly ambush....    THE PAYBACK-Now Gideon wanted answers, and he wasn't going to stop until someone paid for what had happened to him and Rafe. But the powers that be were equally determined to force Gideon-and the world-to forget this covert operation gone totally wrong. Yet Gideon refused to be blackmailed, threatened, or bought off. And what began with a stolen computer let him to the trail of a mysterious woman, Dr. Zimmerman, whom everyone seemed intent on finding. For Zimmerman's knowledge could compromise not only U.S. security but that of every nation in the world!. "

The problem was that outsiders--tourists and traders--claimed the streets were crowded with mysterious characters in blue robes and with members of an alien species.    Native-born humans, however, said that was not the case. There were no such blue-robes and no aliens.    Such was the viewpoint of both Herrin the artist and Waden the autocrat--until a crisis of planetary identity forced a life-and-death confrontation between the question of reality and the reality of the question....

But there are those determined to take from her what she will not willingly give, and when she and Jason fall victim to an unforeseen attack, it sets in motion a series of events which will see Jason searching the starways on a mission of vengeance, and Sira leagued with the Drapsk, a little understood race which is extremely adept at trading. For the Drapsk see in Sira a power which could regain them something which has long been lost. And they will do anything to protect this woman who is their greatest hope for the future.... "

Twelve centuries after fate first stranded the colonists on Erna, mankind has achieved an uneasy stalemate, and human sorcerers manipulate the fae for their own profit, little realizing that demonic forces which feed upon such efforts are rapidly gaining in strength. Now, as the hordes of the dark fae multiply, four people -- Priest, Adept, Apprentice, and Sorcerer -- are about to be drawn inexorably together for a mission which will force them to confront an evil beyond their imagining, in a conflict which will put in jeorpardy not only their own lives -- but the very fate of humankind.

All she knows is that somewhere out there, beyond the horizon, she has a sister named Kay, and it's up to Cee to cross the ocean and find her. In a world apart, 16-year-old STEM prodigy Kasey Mizuhara lives in an eco-city built for people who protected the planet?and now need protecting from it.

While Kasey, an introvert and loner, doesn't mind the lifestyle, her sister Celia hated it. Popular and lovable, Celia much preferred the outside world. But no one could have predicted that Celia would take a boat out to sea, never to return. Now it's been three months since Celia's disappearance, and Kasey has given up hope. Logic says that her sister must be dead. But nevertheless, she decides to retrace Celia's last steps. Where they'll lead her, she does not know. Her sister was full of secrets.
