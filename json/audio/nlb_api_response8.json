Now Zack is easy prey for his little brother, Taylor, who's determined to find out once and for all what mysteries Zack has hidden in his pocket. Like every book in the Alien in My Pocket series,  On Impact!  mixes Common Core\u2013aligned science and safe, hands-on experiments with a hilarious story that young readers will love.
