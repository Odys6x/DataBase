                "Barry Took presents this revised radio version of the popular parlour game 'Twenty Questions'  Hosted by veteran humorist Barry Took, presenter of  Points of View  and former chair of  The News Quiz , this entertaining guessing game sees a panel of intellectually acute guests attempting to determine a mystery object in 20 tries. Their only clue is the category it falls into: animal, vegetable, mineral, abstract, or a combination of all four. For most rounds, the studio audience know the answer and cheer on the contestants with promising guesses - but sometimes, both they and the listeners are kept in the dark, giving them an opportunity to play along too. Pitting their wits against Barry Took are panellists  Geoffrey Durham, Jeremy Hanley, Helen Atkinson Wood, Hattie Hayridge, Dick Vosburgh, Neil Innes, Jan Ravens, Nigel Dempster, Frances Edmonds, Chris Serle  and  Clare Francis , as they play their hunches and attempt to identify everything from a supermodel to a Page 3 girl, the Channel Tunnel to the shipping forecast, and a minicab driver to man's best friend. Using their best deductive reasoning, will they figure it out - or will they get stumped?

                "The Lord of the Rings    meets  Moneyball  in this   fascinating and authoritative history of Dungeons & Dragons that \"tracks D&D's turbulent rise, fall, and survival, from its heyday in the 1980s...to the twenty-first century\" ( The Wall Street Journal ), by award-winning journalist David M. Ewalt.   Even if you've never played Dungeons & Dragons, you probably know someone who has: the game has had a profound influence on our culture, and 2014 marks the intriguing role-playing phenomenon's 40th anniversary. Released decades before the Internet and social media, Dungeons & Dragons inspired one of the original nerd subcultures and is still revered by more than 30 million fans. Now, the authoritative history and magic of the game are revealed by an award-winning journalist and lifelong D&D player.   In  Of Dice and Men,  David Ewalt   describes the development of Dungeons & Dragons from the game's origins on the battlefields of ancient Europe through the hysteria that linked it to satanic rituals and teen suicides to its apotheosis as father of the modern video-game industry. As he chronicles the surprising history of the game's origins (a history largely unknown even to hardcore players) and examines D&D's lasting impact, Ewalt weaves laser-sharp subculture analysis with his own present-day gaming experiences, \"writing about the world of fantasy role-playing junkies with intelligence, dexterity, and even wisdom\" (Ken Jennings). An enticing blend of history, journalism, narrative, and memoir,  Of Dice and Men  sheds light on America's most popular (and widely misunderstood) form of collaborative entertainment. "

If you love games, or know someone who does, you'll know that board games today form a part of people's lives every bit as cherished as music, movies, books or sports. Board games have become staples of popular culture around which we live our lives, and through which we navigate and remember many of life's ups and downs. From chess and checkers to CATAN and Carcassonne, board games bring people together and touch lives in unlikely and surprising ways. In this charming volume, authors including leading industry professionals and lifelong gamers from all walks of life tell us in their own words what board games mean to them. From stories of friends and loved ones met through games to how others came to make careers and livelihoods out of them, from the story of how an academic strike in Nigeria led to the founding of the first board games convention in Sub-Saharan Africa to how board games helped one autistic child discover his dream job, the essays in this volume lift the lid on how games have changed lives in the most remarkable ways. Warm and witty, heartening and heartfelt, the twenty-eight personal accounts that make up this diverse collection bring together authors, artists, designers, parents, academics, an actor, a librarian and more to offer a remarkable insight into just why board games mean so much to so many.

Spanning millennia, oceans and continents, countries and cultures, Around the World in 80 Games gleefully explores how mathematics and games have always been deeply intertwined. Marcus du Sautoy investigates how games provided the first opportunities for deep mathematical insight into the world, how understanding maths can help us play games better, and how both maths and games are integral to human psychology and culture. For as long as there have been people, there have been games, and for nearly as long, we have been exploring and discovering mathematics. A grand adventure, Around the World in 80 Games teaches us not just how games are won, but how they, and the maths behind them, shape who we are. "

                "While the Western was dying a slow death across the cultural landscape, it was blazing back to life as a video game in the early twenty-first century. Rockstar Games' Red Dead franchise, beginning with Red Dead Revolver in 2004, has grown into one of the most critically acclaimed video game franchises of the twenty-first century. Red Dead Redemption: History, Myth, and Violence in the Video Game West offers a critical, interdisciplinary look at this cultural phenomenon at the intersection of game studies and American history. Drawing on game studies, western history, American studies, and cultural studies, the authors train a wide-ranging, deeply informed analytic perspective on the Red Dead franchise-from its earliest incarnation to the latest, Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018). Their intersecting chapters put the series in the context of American history, culture, and contemporary media, with inquiries into issues of authenticity, realism, the meaning of play and commercial promotion, and the relationship between the game and the wider cultural iterations of the classic Western. The contributors also delve into the role the series' development has played in recent debates around working conditions in the gaming industry and gaming culture. "

                "From Frank Brady, who wrote one of the bestselling books on Bobby Fischer of all time and who was himself a friend of Fischer's, comes an impressively researched biography that for the first time completely captures the remarkable arc of Bobby Fischer's life. When Bobby Fischer passed away in January 2008, he left behind a confounding legacy. Everyone knew the basics of his life\u2014he began as a brilliant youngster, then became the pride of American chess, then took a sharp turn, struggling with paranoia and mental illness. But nobody truly understood him. What motivated Fischer from such a young age, and what was the source of his remarkable intellect? How could a man so ambivalent about money and fame be so driven to succeed? What drew this man of Jewish descent to fulminate against Jews, and how was it that a mind so famously disciplined could unravel so completely? From Fischer's meteoric rise, to an utterly dominant prime unequaled by any American chess player, to his eventual descent into madness, the book draws upon hundreds of newly discovered documents and recordings and numerous firsthand interviews conducted with those who knew Fischer best. It paints, for the very first time, a complete picture of one of America's most enigmatic icons. This is the definitive account of a fascinating man and an extraordinary life, one that at last reconciles Fischer's deeply contradictory legacy and answers the question, \"who was Bobby Fischer?\" "

                "Ever wondered when board games got so good? The last forty years have seen nothing short of a revolution in the world of tabletop games. No longer synonymous with family arguments over a game of Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit, board games and the once niche hobby of tabletop gaming have moved into the mainstream over the last four decades, with modern classics like CATAN, Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne becoming established household names. In this informative and entertaining volume, this revolution in tabletop gaming is revealed and reviewed by one of the most knowledgeable commentators there is. James Wallis explores the evolving world of board games through the lens of the Spiel des Jahres, Germany's prestigious Game of the Year award, looking at a host of past winners catapulted to worldwide popularity, once lauded games now sadly forgotten, and a few popular hits that somehow missed out. Alongside this, Wallis expertly chronicles the increasing sophistication in the design of modern board games and their ever growing variety. Everybody Wins is a book for anyone who loves games, wonders what all the fuss is about or just wants to know what to play next\u2014the essential, hugely readable study of the modern board game. "

In  You've Been Played , game designer Adrian Hon delivers a blistering takedown of how corporations, schools, and governments use games and gamification as tools for profit and coercion. These are games that we often have no choice but to play, where losing has heavy penalties.  You've Been Played  is a scathing indictment of a tech-driven world that wants to convince us that misery is fun, and a call to arms for anyone who hopes to preserve their dignity and autonomy. "

From dedicated hustlers who put thousands of miles on their odometers driving coast to coast to challenge the top players in arcades, to fans who devote their free time to collecting action figures, setting world records, and plumbing the depths of its lore, the Mortal Kombat franchise has topped sales charts for thirty years, and its popularity shows no signs of waning. But before Mortal Kombat offended politicians and sold over 12 million units (and counting), executives at Midway saw it as filler-a stopgap between more promising games like NBA Jam. Cocreators Ed Boon and John Tobias felt differently. But not even they could have imagined the phenomenon Mortal Kombat would become when it hit arcades in October 1992, or the controversy that would follow in its wake. Based on extensive interviews, Long Live Mortal Kombat: Round 1 chronicles the arcade era of the video game industry's most infamous fighting series, the creative and technical hurdles its team had to clear, and the personal stories of the fans whose passion has made Mortal Kombat a pillar of popular culture.

                "The designer of  Unreal  and  Gears of War  offers an eye-opening personal account of the video game industry as it grew from niche hobby to hundred-billion-dollar enterprise.  Video games are dominating the planet. In 2020, they brought in $180 billion dollars globally\u2014nearly $34 billion in the United States alone. So who are the brilliant designers who create these stunning virtual worlds? Cliff Bleszinski\u2014or CliffyB as he is known to gamers\u2014is one of the few who've reached mythical, rock star status. In  Control Freak , he gives an unvarnished, all-access tour of the business.   Toiling away in his bedroom, Bleszinski created and shipped his first game before graduating high school, and at just seventeen joined a fledgling company called Epic Games. He describes the grueling hours, obscene amounts of Mountain Dew and obsessive focus necessary to achieve his singular creative visions. He details Epic's rise to industry leader, thanks largely to his work on bestselling franchises  Unreal  and  Gears of War  (and, later, his input on a little game called  Fortnite ), as well as his own awkward ascent from shy, acne-riddled introvert to sports car-driving celebrity rubbing shoulders with Bill Gates. As he writes, \"No one is weirder than a nerd with money.\" While the book is laced with such self-deprecating humor, Bleszinski also bluntly addresses the challenges that have long-faced the gaming community, including sexism and a lack of representation among both designers and the characters they create.    Control Freak  is a hilarious, thoughtful, and inspiring memoir. Even if you don't play games, you'll walk away from this book recognizing them as a true art form and appreciating the genius of their creators. "

You won\u2019t want to put this one down.\u201d\u2014Eddie Adlum, publisher,  RePlay Magazine   As video games evolve, only the fittest companies survive. Making a blockbuster once cost millions of dollars; now it can cost hundreds of millions, but with a $160 billion market worldwide, the biggest players are willing to bet the bank. Steven L. Kent has been playing video games since  Pong  and writing about the industry since the Nintendo Entertainment System. In volume 1 of  The Ultimate History of Video Games,  he chronicled the industry\u2019s first thirty years. In volume 2, he narrates gaming\u2019s entrance into the twenty-first century, as Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and Microsoft battle to capture the global market. The home console boom of the \u201990s turned hobby companies like Nintendo and Sega into Hollywood-studio-sized business titans. But by the end of the decade, they would face new, more powerful competitors. In boardrooms on both sides of the Pacific, engineers and executives began, with enormous budgets and total secrecy, to plan the next evolution of home consoles. The PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Sega Dreamcast all made radically different bets on what gamers would want. And then, to the shock of the world, Bill Gates announced the development of the one console to beat them all\u2014even if Microsoft had to burn a few billion dollars to do it. In this book, you will learn about \u2022 the cutthroat environment at Microsoft as rival teams created console systems \u2022 the day the head of Sega of America told the creator of  Sonic the Hedgehog  to \u201cf**k off\u201d \u2022 how \u201clateral thinking with withered technology\u201d put Nintendo back on top \u2022 and much more! Gripping and comprehensive,  The Ultimate History of Video Games: Volume 2  explores the origins of modern consoles and of the franchises\u2014from  Grand Theft Auto  and  Halo  to  Call of Duty  and  Guitar Hero \u2014that would define gaming in the new millennium.

Co-created by wargame enthusiasts Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, the original  Dungeons & Dragons  role-playing game released by TSR (Tactical Studies Rules) in 1974 created a radical new medium: the role-playing game. For the next two decades, TSR rocketed to success, producing multiple editions of  D&D , numerous settings for the game, magazines, video games,  New York Times  bestselling novels by Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman, and R. A. Salvatore, and even a TV show! But by 1997, a series of ruinous choices and failed projects brought TSR to the edge of doom\u2014only to be saved by their fiercest competitor, Wizards of the Coast, the company behind the collectible card game  Magic: The Gathering . Unearthed from Ben Riggs's own adventurous campaign of in-depth research, interviews with major players, and acquisitions of secret documents,  Slaying the Dragon  reveals the true story of the rise and fall of TSR. Go behind the scenes of their Lake Geneva headquarters where innovative artists and writers redefined the sword and sorcery genre, managers and executives sabotaged their own success by alienating their top talent, ignoring their customer fanbase, accruing a mountain of debt, and agreeing to deals which, by the end, made them into a publishing company unable to publish so much as a postcard. As epic and fantastic as the adventures TSR published,  Slaying the Dragon  is the legendary tale of the rise and fall of the company that created the role-playing game world. "

                "When Dungeons & Dragons was first released to a small hobby community, it hardly seemed destined for mainstream success-and yet this arcane tabletop role-playing game became an unlikely pop culture phenomenon. In Game Wizards, Jon Peterson chronicles the rise of Dungeons & Dragons from hobbyist pastime to mass market sensation, from the initial collaboration to the later feud of its creators, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. As the game's fiftieth anniversary approaches, Peterson-a noted authority on role-playing games-explains how D&D and its creators navigated their successes, setbacks, and controversies. Peterson describes Gygax and Arneson's first meeting and their work toward the 1974 release of the game; the founding of TSR and its growth as a company; and Arneson's acrimonious departure and subsequent challenges to TSR. He recounts the \"Satanic Panic\" accusations that D&D was sacrilegious and dangerous, and how they made the game famous. With Game Wizards, Peterson restores historical particulars long obscured by competing narratives spun by the one-time partners. That record amply demonstrates how the turbulent experience of creating something as momentous as Dungeons & Dragons can make people remember things a bit differently from the way they actually happened.

It's now an industry worth billions of pounds.

Three generations of humans have now been molded into results-oriented workers who cannot mess up, and therefore may never innovate either. Shared software, skills, and experiences equal no surprises. Surrounded by the unwavering, reliable results made possible by a machine, we all marinate in this ubiquitous cybersauce. Behold! Thousands of shiny new apps, sites, products, and services that look, feel, and are essentially the same. Because computers don't make mistakes.Chance is the natural foil to the digital. We combine both for originality. This makes for the kind of exciting, hopeful future we want. We embrace technology but need to slap it around a bit to get someplace new.Human error sparks connections. In a relaxed situation where one's hypercritical demons are AWOL, the snap, crackle, pop of brainstorms happen all around us.A fresh, colorful guide to discovery, with clearly marked directions and witty prompts, this is a book about living a productive, individualistic life. Whatever your job, it gives you a way to zig while everyone around you can only zag. It will also make you laugh along the way. "

Jason Schreier's groundbreaking reporting has earned him a place among the preeminent investigative journalists covering the world of video games. In his eagerly anticipated, deeply researched new book, Schreier trains his investigative eye on the volatility of the video game industry and the resilience of the people who work in it.The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games\u2014Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more\u2014on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them,  Press Reset  tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely.Schreier's insider interviews cover hostile takeovers, abusive bosses, corporate drama, bounced checks, and that one time the Boston Red Sox's Curt Schilling decided he was going to lead a game studio that would take out World of Warcraft. Along the way, he asks pressing questions about why, when the video game industry is more successful than ever, it's become so hard to make a stable living making video games\u2014and whether the business of making games can change before it's too late.

                "Logic puzzles were first introduced to the public by Lewis Carroll in the late nineteenth century and have been popular ever since. Games like Sudoku and Mastermind are fun and engrossing recreational activities, but they also share deep foundations in mathematical logic and are worthy of serious intellectual inquiry. In this informative and entertaining book, Jason Rosenhouse begins by introducing listeners to logic and logic puzzles and goes on to reveal the rich history of these puzzles. He shows how Carroll's puzzles presented Aristotelian logic as a game for children, yet also informed his scholarly work on logic. He reveals how another pioneer of logic puzzles, Raymond Smullyan, drew on classic puzzles about liars and truthtellers to illustrate Kurt G\u00f6del's theorems and illuminate profound questions in mathematical logic. Rosenhouse then presents a new vision for the future of logic puzzles based on nonclassical logic, which is used today in computer science and automated reasoning to manipulate large and sometimes contradictory sets of data. Featuring a wealth of sample puzzles ranging from simple to extremely challenging, this lively and engaging book brings together many of the most ingenious puzzles ever devised, including the \"Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever,\" metapuzzles, paradoxes, and the logic puzzles in detective stories.

It's Seabiscuit meets Narcos, and  the best true-life gambling  story ever told.  In the late 1980s, a spectacular 3-year-old female racehorse named Winning Colors was being groomed for success under her famous \"Hollywood\" trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, and the billionaire owner of the San Diego Chargers pro-football team, Eugene Klein. Meanwhile, three fun-loving gamblers, Miami Paul, Dino Mateo, and Big Bernie believed that Winning Colors could be the unlikely female winner of the 1988 Kentucky Derby.  When the gamblers unknowingly place their longshot bet with members of a suspected drug cartel at a racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico, they must figure out how to claim their prize - without getting killed in the process. In a heart-pounding race of their own across the U.S.-Mexico border, the trio come face-to-face with suspected killers, are arrested by the Border Patrol, and fumble their way through the riskiest bet of their lives.

She had faced a stretch of personal bad luck, and her reflections on the role of chance in her life had pointed her to poker as the ultimate master class in learning to distinguish what can be controlled and what can't. Seidel was in, and soon Konnikova was down the rabbit hole with him, a journey that would lead her to the following year's World Series of Poker. Then something extraordinary happened. Under Seidel's guidance, Konnikova began to have many epiphanies about life that derived from her new pursuit, including how to better read not just her opponents but far more importantly herself. She found her way to making better decisions and to a place where she could accept luck for what it is, and what it isn't. But she also began to win. She even learned to like Las Vegas. In the end, Konnikova is a student of human behaviour, and ultimately the point of her incredible adventure was to render it into a container for its invaluable lessons. The biggest bluff of all, she learned is that skill is enough. This is a book that will focus your mind and strengthen your hand. "

                "From a real-life derring-do woman, exhilarating stories, activities, and tips to inspire girls to pursue a life of adventure and excitement.    Why should girls miss out on the joy of adventure? They can jump off rocks, swing on ropes, and climb trees just as well as boys can. But girls often allow fear to stand in their way.  In  The Gutsy Girl , author Caroline Paul emboldens girls to seek out a life of exhilaration. Once a young scaredy-cat herself, Caroline decided that fear got in the way of the life she wanted\u2014of excitement, confidence, self-reliance, friendship, and fun. She has since flown planes, rafted big rivers, climbed tall mountains, and fought fires as one of the first female firefighters in San Francisco. In  The Gutsy Girl , she shares her greatest escapades as well as those of other girls and women from throughout history, and offers engaging activities such as confidence-building stances, creating a compass, positive self-talk, and using crickets to estimate outside temperatures. Each section includes a place for girls to \"journal\" their adventures, thus encouraging a new generation to develop a zest for challenges and a healthy relationship to risk.  The Gutsy Girl  is  Lean In  for young girls, a book about the glorious things that happen when you unshackle from fear and open up to exhilaration. Fully illustrated and enlivened throughout by bestselling illustrator Wendy MacNaughton's whimsical pen-and-ink drawings.   Includes a PDF of Maps, Illustrations, and Journal Entry Pages. "

                "In June 2007, the FBI informed the NBA that one of its referees, Tim Donaghy, was the subject of a probe into illegal gambling. Within months, the public knew the broad outlines of a scheme involving Donaghy betting on games he officiated with a coconspirator, longtime Donaghy acquaintance and professional gambler Jimmy \"Baba\" Battista. They were joined in the scandal by a mutual childhood friend, Tommy Martino. By November 2008, each man had pleaded guilty to charges relating to the conspiracy, and was in federal prison. Author Sean Patrick Griffin, PhD, a former Philadelphia police officer turned university professor and bestselling author, conducted dozens of interviews and obtained betting records, referee statistics, court documents, and unique access to witness statements and confidential law enforcement files. Years of research are presented in Gaming the Game, which looks inside the FBI's investigation and beyond to provide the definitive account of the scandal. Jimmy Battista's remarkable decades-long bookmaking and betting career is examined, including and especially his role as architect of the widely publicized scandal. Battista, who-unlike his coconspirators-never spoke with federal authorities, reveals for the first time the intricate details of the scheme, most of which only he knows. "

                "\"A smart, funny, and slyly profound book about the dark ecstasies of obsessive love. Sasha Chapin is a gentlemanly Gonzo, a dirty Bond, and he writes like a dream.\" \u2014Claudia Dey, author of  Heartbreaker   Sasha Chapin is a victim of chess. Like countless amateurs before him\u2014Albert Einstein, Humphrey Bogart, Marcel Duchamp\u2014the game has consumed his life and his mind. First captivated by it as a member of his high school chess club, his passion was rekindled during an accidental encounter with chess hustlers on the streets of Kathmandu. In its aftermath, he forgot how to care about anything else. He played at all hours, for weeks at a time. Like a spurned lover, he tried to move on, but he found the game more seductive the more he resisted it.  And so, he thought, if he can't defeat his obsession, he had to succumb to it.   All the Wrong Moves  traces Chapin's rollicking two-year journey around the globe in search of glory. He travels to tournaments in Bangkok and Hyderabad. He seeks out a mentor in St. Louis, a grandmaster whose personality is half rabbi and half monk, and who offers cryptic wisdom and caustic insults (\"you're the best player in your chair\"). His story builds toward the Los Angeles Open, where Chapin is clearly outmatched and yet no less determined  not to lose . Along the way, he chronicles the highs and lows of his fixation, driven on this quest by lust, terror, and the elusive possibility of victory. Stylish, inventive, and laugh-out-loud funny,  All the Wrong Moves  is more than a work of history or autobiography. It's a celebration of the purity, violence, and beauty of the game. "

                "A firsthand account of the dramatic 2016 World Chess Championship between Norway's Magnus Carlsen and Russia's Sergey Karjakin, which mirrored the world's geopolitical unrest and rekindled a global fascination with the sport.The first week of November 2016, as a crowd of people swarmed outside of Manhattan's Trump Tower to rail against the election of Donald Trump, hundreds more descended on the city's South Street Seaport. But they weren't there to protest. They were there to watch the World Chess Championship between Norway's Magnus Carlsen and Russia's Sergey Karjakin\u2014what by the time it was over would be front-page news and thought by many the greatest finish in chess history. The story lines were riveting. The championship hadn't been hosted in New York City, the de facto world capital of the sport, in more than two decades. With both Carlsen and Karjakin just 25 years old, the tournament organizers were billing it as a battle of the millennials\u2014the first time the championship had been waged among the generation that grew up playing chess primarily against computers. And perhaps most intriguing were all the geopolitical connections to the match. Originally from Crimea, Karjakin had recently repatriated to Russia under the direct assistance of Putin. Carlsen, meanwhile, had expressed admiration for Donald Trump, and his first move of the tournament he played with a smirk what's called a Trompowsky Attack. Then there was the Russian leader of the World Chess Federation being barred from attending due to US sanctions, and chess fanatic and Trump adviser Peter Thiel being called on to make the honorary first move in sudden death. That the tournament required sudden death was a shock. Oddsmakers had given Carlsen, the defending champion, an 80% chance of winning. It would take everything he had to retain his title. In doing so, he would firmly make his case to be considered the greatest player chess has ever seen. Author Brin-Jonathan Butler was granted unique access to the two-and-half-week tournament and watched every move. In The Grandmaster, he aims to do for Magnus Carlsen what Norman Mailer did for Muhammed Ali in The Fight, John McPhee did for Arthur Ashe in Levels of the Game, and David Foster Wallace did for Roger Federer in his famous New York Times Magazine profile. Butler captures one of the world's greatest sportsmen at the height of their powers, and attempts to decipher the secret to that greatness. "

                "An acclaimed novelist and critic argues that video games are the most vital art form of our timeVideo games have been around for decades, but only in recent years have they gone truly mainstream. Today, the majority of American households play video games, almost half of gamers are women, and professional video game tournaments attract more viewers than the World Series. Yet we still don't take games seriously, preferring to see them as little more than entertaining diversions, a means of making the commute go by a little more quickly.In Bit by Bit, a blend of history, memoir, and reportage, Andrew Ervin sets out to understand the explosive popularity of this often maligned cultural form. He travels to government laboratories, junk shops, and art museums. He interviews scientists and hobbyists, critics and game makers. He installs a full-sized and obscenely loud Donkey Kong arcade cabinet in his basement, and plays enough Minecraft to suffer from \"Minecraft syndrome,\" the effect of seeing objects in real life as poorly rendered blocks.In exploring the material, technological, and business history of video games, from Tennis for Two (1958) to Pokemon Go and beyond, Ervin shows how games constitute a unique storytelling medium that offers us startling new ways to think about our lives and the world around us. And he argues that the best games, as defined by the aesthetic and even political ambitions of their creators, rise to the level of art. In this witty, searching book, Ervin explains the immense power of games&#8212;and why their reign will be long. "

It was the dawn of a new era in artificial intelligence: a machine capable of beating the reigning human champion at this most cerebral game.That moment was more than a century in the making, and in this breakthrough book, Kasparov reveals his astonishing side of the story for the first time. He describes how it felt to strategize against an implacable, untiring opponent with the whole world watching, and recounts the history of machine intelligence through the microcosm of chess, considered by generations of scientific pioneers to be a key to unlocking the secrets of human and machine cognition. Kasparov uses his unrivaled experience to look into the future of intelligent machines and sees it bright with possibility. As many critics decry artificial intelligence as a menace, particularly to human jobs, Kasparov shows how humanity can rise to new heights with the help of our most extraordinary creations, rather than fear them. Deep Thinking is a tightly argued case for technological progress, from the man who stood at its precipice with his own career at stake. "

                "An eye-popping and hilarious joyride through the underworld of sports betting&#160;Beth Raymer arrived in Las Vegas in 2001, hoping to land a job as a cocktail waitress at one of the big casinos. In the meantime, she lived in a $17-a-night motel with her dog, Otis, and waited tables at a low-rent Thai restaurant. One day, one of her regular customers told her about a job she thought Beth would be perfect for and sent her to see Dink, of Dink Inc. Dink was a professional sports gambler&#8212;one of the biggest in Vegas. He was looking for a right-hand man&#8212;someone who would show up on time, who had a head for numbers, and who didn&#8217;t steal. She got the job.Lay the Favorite is the story of Beth Raymer&#8217;s years in the high-stakes, high-anxiety world of sports betting&#8212;a period that saw the fall of the local bookie and the rise of the freewheeling, unregulated offshore sports book, and with it the elevation of sports betting in popular culture. As the business explodes, Beth rises&#8212;from assistant to expert, trusted and seasoned enough to open an offshore booking office in the Caribbean with a few associates, men who leave their families up north to make a quick killing, while donning new tropical personas fueled by abundant drugs and local girlfriends, and who one by one succumb to their vices. They lie, cheat, steal, and run, until Beth is the last man standing.Beth Raymer is a natural storyteller: funny, charming, and fully awake to the ironies around her. But she is also a keen and compassionate observer of the adrenaline-addicted, rougish types who become her mentors, her enemies, her family. Raymer brings to life a world that teems with pathos and ecstasy in this wild picaresque that also tells the story of a young woman&#8217;s crazy, sexy, most unlikely coming-of-age.From the Hardcover edition.

Now, in Fantasy Man, he's flat on his back.Six years have passed since the former Denver Broncos tight end wore a helmet, and every day he drifts further from the NFL Guy, the sanctioned-violence guy, the psychopath who ran head first into other psychos for money. But Nate hasn't quite left the game. Bed-ridden by a recent surgery to remove bone fragments in his ankle, he's trying to defend his title in one of the millions of leagues captivating America through modern fantasy football, the interactive human poker game started by rotisserie leagues, boosted by ESPN and Yahoo!, and now elevated to that rarefied world of vaguely-legal Internet gambling by FanDuel and DraftKings.com. And this time it isn't a 300-pound wall of flesh rushing to crunch his spine. It's worse.Exploring the fantasy&#8212;and the reality&#8212;of professional football after you've left the field, Fantasy Man is as funny, self-deprecating, and shockingly honest as Slow Getting Up.

The key to becoming a great poker player is in knowing what it depends on. At last there's a book that gives you that answer.

Decide to Play Great Poker teaches you how to identify and analyze those variables, interchange them within basic game-situation templates, and become knowledgeable, comfortable, and confident in any poker situation. Instead of just dictating a bunch of rules that work only some of the time, this book teaches you to become a great poker thinker and strategist so that you can expertly navigate any poker challenge you encounter. Most players think the goal of poker is to make money. They're wrong! The goal of poker is to make good decisions. Money is simply the way you measure how well you're meeting that objective. So if you're ready to start making world-class decisions at the poker table - and to reap the substantial rewards that those decisions will yield - all you have to do is decide: Decide to Play Great Poker now. You'll never be vexed by \"it depends\" again. "

So, how can you take charge of your own story, and start on the road to healing? This compassionate guided journal offers a personalized, constructive, and healing approach to managing your symptoms. Through the act of writing, you'll gain insight into the four elements of BPD\u2014emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and relationships\u2014and find powerful tools to balance your emotions, reverse unhealthy habits that get in the way of meaningful relationships, and move past feelings of shame and regret to cultivate self-compassion. This book will help you gain empowering insight into yourself and your unique mind, so you'll feel equipped to step out into a world where you know you belong. "

                "The buzzworthy 'famous people' quiz about noteworthy and notorious figures from fact and fiction   Who Goes There?  is the classic stardom panel quiz chaired by Martin Young. Proving that it's not what you know but who you know, each breezy episode features two celebrity teams battling to answer questions on famous figures from history, fiction, sport, and the gossip pages. Martin Young challenges the teams with hilarious and unusual archive clips, tests them on bizarre stage names and aliases, and reads out surprising CVs to have the panel guess the famous name at the top. Enjoying scandalous quotations, unconventional career highlights, and even a 'fleeting fame' round (in which panellists are challenged to remember when a certain person was all everyone talked about),  Who Goes There?  welcomes in anyone from Julius Caesar to Juliet Capulet to Julia Roberts. If you've made a name for yourself, you could be a question!  A lively, fun show featuring sparkling and sharp-witted guest panellists, including Claire Rayner, Joan Bakewell, Francis Wheen, Carmen Callil, Gyles Brandreth, Annabel Giles, Sheridan Morley, Jonathan Meades, David Aaronovitch, Lynne Truss, and many, many more.

                "Can a former semi-pro win against the best poker players in the world?  In 2006, Johnny's pie-in-the-sky dreams of becoming world champion were dashed when his kings ran into aces in the World Series of Poker Main Event. But lady luck was with him when he met Amy, the woman of his dreams, who soon became his wife. Like many players, he drifted away from the game after Congress passed a law later that year that cut off funds to online poker and harkened the decline of the game. But even as Johnny returned to the working world, the itch remained. A decade later, now with two small kids in tow, Johnny convinces Amy to take a six-week family trip from their home in rural Alabama to Las Vegas, where he will risk his $10,000 bankroll in hopes of playing in the Main Event again and winning millions. Along the way, he examines how the game has changed since 2006. Although the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was the beginning of the end of the poker boom, the game still thrives, and WSOP is Exhibit A. Johnny also muses on the outlandishness of the adult fairyland that is Vegas. "
