Obsessed with beating German General Erwin Rommel, he poured into the Middle East massive resources that should have gone to the Far East.

Lean Logistics updates Air Force logistics operations by applying technology and management innovations that have proven effective in the commercial world, are relevant to the central supply problems of the Air Force, and are affordable. The analysis in this study used Air Force data to drive simulations of C-5 logistics operations and considered peacetime flying programs. This study found that a high-velocity infrastructure would provide C-5 performance that is the same as or better than that provided by the current infrastructure across a wide range of conditions and circumstances. A high-velocity infrastructure would require only one-sixth the amount of inventory at one-third the cost of the current infrastructure to produce the same operational performance. "

                "\"Aljunied examines how the Singaporean government developed a comprehensive state-society strategic relationship by 'securitising' vital policy areas due to Singapore's vulnerability as a global city-state. In the 21st Century, the Singaporean government has strategically renewed an existing form of authoritarian rule by 'militarising' national security governance. The overall effect is to widen and deepen state power. Senior military-trained civilian political leaders and bureaucrats use military personnel, command and control, terminology and strategy of war to deal with non-traditional security challenges leading to the state's further domination over civil liberty and civil society. Aljunied analyses the information and communication, health, and climate-environment sectors. The case studies highlight the way the Singaporean government has used varying forms of political engagement, surveillance, and legislation to limit civil liberty and inhibit the development of civil society. A valuable resource for researchers and students of Singapore Studies as well as for Security Studies readers with an interest in the Global-Local nexus in a small state context. This book is a pioneering scholarly effort on the national security framework and the use of non-traditional security discourse to strengthen state power and social stability at the expense of political liberalism\"-- Provided by publisher.

Academic attention has been stimulated by the rapidly changing regional environment, most notably the rise of China and the North Korean nuclear program; and by the evolving political scene in Japan, most importantly the activist and iconoclastic leadership of Prime Minister Koizumi. The recent collapse of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the inauguration a Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) government under Prime Minister Hatoyama with a different vision of the Japan-U.S. alliance and Japan's role in the world has launched a new round of journal articles, many challenging some of the assumptions of the earlier analysis about the likely evolution of Japan-U.S. relations and Japan's foreign policy. Most of the recent analysis of the alliance and Japan has been focused on the broad political, economic, and demographic trends that are shaping the external and internal environment. There has been little examination of the institutional changes in Japan that both reflect the evolution in Japan's security policy to date and provide new capabilities and legal flexibility for Japan to take on an expanded military role in the future. This volume fills this void with a comprehensive and multidimensional analysis that links the historical evolution of Japan's security policies to its current capabilities and prospects. "

                "The confrontation that began when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 brought with it the threat that chemical and biological weapons might be used against the more than half a million military personnel the United States deployed to the region. To protect these troops from such threats, the Department of Defense wished to use drugs and vaccines that, not having been tested for use in these specific situations, were considered \"investigational\" by the federal Food and Drug Administration. This report examines the history of the Interim Rule, adopted in December 21, 1990, that authorized the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to waive informed consent for the use of investigational drugs and vaccines for certain military uses; how this authority was used for pyridostigmine bromide and botulinum toxoid during the Gulf War; and the subsequent controversy surrounding the rule, its application, and its implications. The report then analyzes the issues the Interim Rule raised when investigational drugs are used for such purposes and makes recommendations for dealing with similar situations in the future. "

                "How does a black American prepare for a career in a profession traditionally closed to blacks? And how does he or she cope with the frustrations and dangers that subsequent experiences generate? A-Train is the story of one of the black Americans who, during World War II, graduated from Tuskegee Army Flying School and served as a pilot in the 99th Pursuit Squadron. Charles W. Dryden has prepared an honest, fast-paced, balanced, vividly written, and very personal account of what it was like to be a black soldier, and specifically a pilot, during World War II and the Korean War. Colonel Dryden's book commands our attention because it is a balanced account by an insightful man who enlisted in a segregated army and retired from an integrated air force. Dryden's account is poignant in illuminating the hurt inflicted by racism on even the most successful black people. As a member of that elite group of those young pilots who fought for their country overseas while being denied civil liberties at home, Dryden presents an eloquent memoir of the experiences he has shared and the changes he has witnessed.

                "\"General William C. Westmoreland has long been derided for his failed strategy of \"attrition\" in the Vietnam War. Historians have argued that Westmoreland's strategy placed a premium on high \"body counts\" through a \"big unit war\" that relied almost solely on search and destroy missions. Many believe the U.S. Army failed in Vietnam because of Westmoreland's misguided and narrow strategy. In a groundbreaking reassessment of American military strategy in Vietnam, Gregory Daddis overturns conventional wisdom and shows how Westmoreland did indeed develop a comprehensive campaign which included counterinsurgency, civic action, and the importance of gaining political support from the South Vietnamese population. Exploring the realities of a large, yet not wholly unconventional environment, Daddis reinterprets the complex political and military battlefields of Vietnam. Without searching for blame, he analyzes how American civil and military leaders developed strategy and how Westmoreland attempted to implement a sweeping strategic vision. Westmoreland's War is a landmark reinterpretation of one of America's most divisive wars, outlining the multiple, interconnected aspects of American military strategy in Vietnam-combat operations, pacification, nation building, and the training of the South Vietnamese armed forces. Daddis offers a critical reassessment of one of the defining moments in American history\"-- Provided by publisher. "

                "\"General William C. Westmoreland has long been derided for his failed strategy of \"attrition\" in the Vietnam War. Historians have argued that Westmoreland's strategy placed a premium on high \"body counts\" through a \"big unit war\" that relied almost solely on search and destroy missions. Many believe the U.S. Army failed in Vietnam because of Westmoreland's misguided and narrow strategy. In a groundbreaking reassessment of American military strategy in Vietnam, Gregory Daddis overturns conventional wisdom and shows how Westmoreland did indeed develop a comprehensive campaign which included counterinsurgency, civic action, and the importance of gaining political support from the South Vietnamese population. Exploring the realities of a large, yet not wholly unconventional environment, Daddis reinterprets the complex political and military battlefields of Vietnam. Without searching for blame, he analyzes how American civil and military leaders developed strategy and how Westmoreland attempted to implement a sweeping strategic vision. Westmoreland's War is a landmark reinterpretation of one of America's most divisive wars, outlining the multiple, interconnected aspects of American military strategy in Vietnam-combat operations, pacification, nation building, and the training of the South Vietnamese armed forces. Daddis offers a critical reassessment of one of the defining moments in American history\"-- Provided by publisher. "

Though only one in four Vietnam veterans served in combat--and likely even fewer--both popular representations and scholarly treatments of the war focus on combat and its after-effects, erasing comfort, recreation, and fun from the picture. In this ms, Lair instead paints a provocative picture of the Vietnam War in which beauty and ice cream take precedence over the bullets, as they often did for Americans who served there. Lair uncovers. "

Milam's narrative provides a vivid, on-the-ground portrait of what the platoon leader faced: training his men, keeping racial tensions at bay, and preventing alcohol and drug abuse, all in a war without fronts.

Despite the evacuation of its ground troops, the United States promised to materially support its allies' struggle against communist aggression. Over time, however, the American government drastically reduced its funding of the conflict, placing immense strain on the Cambodian and South Vietnamese armed force. "

                "This book provides a multifaceted array of answers to the question, In the ten years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, how has America responded? In a series of essays, RAND authors lend a farsighted perspective to the national dialogue on 9/11's legacy. The essays assess the military, political, fiscal, social, cultural, psychological, and even moral implications of U.S. policymaking since 9/11. Part One of the book addresses the lessons learned from America's accomplishments and mistakes in its responses to the 9/11 attacks and the ongoing terrorist threat. Part Two explores reactions to the extreme ideologies of the terrorists and to the fears they have generated. Part Three presents the dilemmas of asymmetrical warfare and suggests ways to resolve them. Part Four cautions against sacrificing a long-term strategy by imposing short-term solutions, particularly with respect to air passenger security and counterterrorism intelligence. Finally, Part Five looks at the effects of the terrorist attacks on the U.S. public health system, at the potential role of compensation policy for losses incurred by terrorism, and at the possible long-term effects of terrorism and counterterrorism on American values, laws, and society.--Publisher description.

To protect these troops from such threats, the Department of Defense wished to use drugs and vaccines that, not having been tested for use in these specific situations, were considered \"investigational\" by the federal Food and Drug Administration. This report examines the history of the Interim Rule, adopted in December 21, 1990, that authorized the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to waive informed consent for the use of investigational drugs and vaccines for certain military uses; how this authority was used for pyridostigmine bromide and botulinum toxoid during the Gulf War; and the subsequent controversy surrounding the rule, its application, and its implications. The report then analyzes the issues the Interim Rule raised when investigational drugs are used for such purposes and makes recommendations for dealing with similar situations in the future. "

                "On April 29, 1968, the North Vietnamese Army is spotted less than four miles from the U.S. Marines' Dong Ha Combat Base. Intense fighting develops in nearby Dai Do as the 2d Battalion, 4th Marines, known as \"the Magnificent Bastards,\" struggles to eject NVA forces from this strategic position. Yet the BLT 2/4 Marines defy the brutal onslaught. Pressing forward, America's finest warriors rout the NVA from their fortress-hamlets'often in deadly hand-to-hand combat. At the end of two weeks of desperate, grinding battles, the Marines and the infantry battalion supporting them are torn to shreds. But against all odds, they beat back their savage adversary. The Magnificent Bastards captures that gripping conflict in all its horror, hell, and heroism. \"Superb ... among the best writing on the Vietnam War ... Nolan has skillfully woven operational records and oral history into a fascinating narrative that puts the reader in the thick of the action.\" 'Jon T. Hoffman, author of Chesty \"Real and gripping ... combat with all the warts on.\" 'Lieutenant General Victor H. Krulak, USMC (Ret.) From the Paperback edition. "

This book looks at the changing nature of relationships between countries in Southeast Asia, as well as their relationships with other states in Asia and beyond. A diverse region in many areas, open to outside influence in many fields, but not without dynamics of its own, Southeast Asia has been through centuries the site of states with very differing levels of power and in a variety of forms. It has also been exposed to powerful neighbours, seawards empires and contending world powers. Adopting a historical approach, the book analyses state relations against the background of regional and geopolitical developments from within and without. It discusses how Southeast Asian states of the 21st century can best preserve their security in the context of the rise of China, and goes on to look at the extent to which they can preserve their autonomy of action. Offering a long-term perspective on these issues, this inter-disciplinary study is of interest to scholars and students of Southeast Asian history and politics, world history and international relations\"-- Provided by publisher.
