When an old military buddy turns up at the ranch he shares with two friends, Noah Harding never imagines the friend will skip out overnight and leave his baby boy behind. Noah will have some choice parenting advice to offer when the baby's mother turns up, but until then, he'll do his best to take care of the little one. Yet when a relieved Jen finally tracks down her son, Noah realizes the story is more complicated than he thought. And soon, so are his feelings for Jen . . . Jen Rossi doesn't expect much from her unreliable ex, but she's shocked to return from an extended mission and discover he's abandoned their son with three men she doesn't know.

And with a winter storm settling in, and close quarters making it impossible to deny their chemistry, this temporary solution might just become the key to forever . . . Contains mature themes. "

The chance to be near his young son is the only thing that could entice former SWAT commander Matt Corbin back to his hometown. Matt has only a few happy memories of his tough childhood in Last Ride, Texas, and most of them involve Emory Parkman. Once his teenage crush, she's now living in a cottage on his late grandfather's ranch, which seems like a good omen...until Matt learns Emory is looking into his family's history, a subject he'd prefer remained closed. Emory's wedding-gown designs are said to bring luck\u2014to everyone but her. Though twice bitten by romance that went sour, she's tempted to take a chance on the rancher next door. Emory and Matt's long-ago attempts at love never got a fair chance, but all these years later, their attraction is stronger than ever. Maybe by unearthing some of his ancestors' long-buried secrets, she can help him finally cast off the past's shadows and prove to Matt that the third time's the charm.

Union soldier John Chenneville suffered a traumatic head wound in battle. His recovery took the better part of a year as he struggled to regain his senses and mobility. By the time he returned home, the Civil War was over, but tragedy awaited. John's beloved sister and her family had been brutally murdered.  Their killer goes by many names. He fought for the North in the late unpleasantness, and wore a badge in the name of the law. But the man John knows as A. J. Dodd is little more than a rabid animal, slaughtering without reason or remorse, needing to be put down.  Traveling through the unforgiving landscape of a shattered nation in the midst of Reconstruction, John braves winter storms and confronts desperate people in pursuit of his quarry. Untethered, single-minded in purpose, he will not be deterred. Not by the U.S. Marshal who threatens to arrest him for murder should he succeed. And not by Victoria Reavis, the telegraphist aiding him in his death-driven quest, yet hoping he'll choose to embrace a life with her instead.   And as he trails Dodd deep into Texas, John accepts that this final reckoning between them may cost him more than all he's already lost... "

Once, Catriona Macgregor led a charmed life. Daughter of a wealthy rancher, pretty and educated, she looked forward to all the world had to offer\u2014until fate took a turn. Now family, home, and even her name have been stripped away. As \"Black Cat Whitfield,\" adopted daughter of an outlaw, she's wanted by the authorities. It certainly wasn't the destiny she imagined\u2014especially as one of the Blessed.  The Blessed, rare people like Cat, are supposed to use their gifts to carry out missions for the Patron Saints, but she can only imagine that Saint Prudentia made a terrible mistake in choosing her. Still, her gift has never deserted her. Whenever danger threatens, Cat receives a vision\u2014just in time to save her life. And when she meets a renegade priest, Father Ignatius, he helps her understand how her ability may be part of a much bigger picture. A picture that involves facing up to the monstrous Baron Caldwell\u2014the one who ordered her parents killed\u2014and his son, Adrian, who betrayed them all.  Cat is torn between guilt over her parents' deaths, a longing for vengeance against their killers, and a dismaying new interest in Adrian. It would be easiest to flee the whole situation and never look back. But as someone once told her, you can't outrun the darkness on your heels. There's only one way to break through to sunrise\u2014by turning to face the night. "

Her bickering with the big, rugged cowboy has become legendary around their small Montana town. But little does anyone know, Charlotte's animosity masks unspoken feelings... because underneath it all, Chance is the only man who ever truly claimed her heart.   Chance has spent his whole life in Rustlers Creek, but he's always been on the outside looking in. He needs to focus on keeping his ranch afloat amid the massive debt left by his late father, and the feelings he harbors for Charlotte don't make it any easier. She's ranching royalty and he's perpetually scrubbing mud off his boots. It's safer to push her away than hope for something he can never have.  When a business opportunity forces Charlotte and Chance to work together, they share a heated moment in each other's arms. The simmering attraction they've fought for years can no longer be ignored, but will Chance's doubts stand in the way of their happiness? Or will he finally declare his love and prove to Charlotte that he's always been her cowboy?. "

Harper Allen has returned to Rustlers Creek but she's not the heartbroken girl who left. After a successful career in Seattle, she's back in her hometown to launch her coffee business with the help of her celebrity sister, the Cowgirl Gourmet. But Harper can't escape handsome veterinarian Gray McClain, the man who broke her heart ten years ago and whose kisses still make her head spin.  Although Gray believed he knew what he was doing when he ended things with Harper, seeing her has made him question everything. He wanted more for her than a life with the son of a town drunk, but every moment with her is heaven. When a freak ranch accident causes Gray to lose some of his memory, he believes he's spent the last decade with Harper, the woman he's never stopped loving, instead of alone.  As Harper helps Gray return to health, she can't deny she's more in love with him than ever. But can she fight for the man of her dreams, even when he's determined to let her go again? When it comes to choosing to forget or choosing to remember, Harper must show Gray she'll always remember her cowboy. "

Highly recommended!\"\u2014  Paulette Jiles,  New York Times  bestselling author of  News of the World    Beautifully rendered,  Where Coyotes Howl  is a vivid and deeply affecting ode to the early twentieth century West, from master storyteller Sandra Dallas.   Except for the way they loved each other, they were just ordinary, everyday folks. Just ordinary.  1916. The two-street town of Wallace is not exactly what Ellen Webster had in mind when she accepted a teaching position in Wyoming, but within a year's time she's fallen in love\u2014both with the High Plains and with a handsome cowboy named Charlie Bacon. Life is not easy in the flat, brown corner of the state where winter blizzards are unforgiving and the summer heat relentless. But Ellen and Charlie face it all together, their relationship growing stronger with each shared success, and each deeply felt tragedy.  Ellen finds purpose in her work as a rancher's wife and in her bonds with other women settled on the prairie. Not all of them are so lucky as to have loving husbands, not all came to Wallace willingly, and not all of them can survive the cruel seasons. But they look out for each other, share their secrets, and help one another in times of need. And the needs are great and constant. The only city to speak of, Cheyenne, is miles away, making it akin to the Wild West in rural Wallace. In the end, it is not the trials Ellen and Charlie face together that make them remarkable, but their love for one another that endures through it all.  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

                "Cormac McCarthy is a quiet, unassuming presence in American fiction today, but like the slow, measured voices of many of his characters, he speaks with an authority and conviction that demands an audience. All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy's sixth novel, is a cowboy odyssey for modern times. Set in the late 1940s, it features the travels and toils of a 16-year-old East Texan named John Grady Cole, caught in the agonizing purgatory between adolescence and adulthood. At the start of the novel, Cole's grandfather has just died, his parents have permanently separated, and the family ranch, upon which he had placed so many boyish hopes, has been sold. Rootless and increasingly restive, Cole leaves Texas, accompanied by his friend Lacey Rawlins, and begins a journey across the vaquero frontier into the badlands of northern Mexico. In spite of its hard realities and spare telling, All the Pretty Horses is a lyrical and richly romantic story, chronicling-along with the erosion of the frontier-the loss of an era. "

To achieve its goals, Talon is flouting the law, bribing public officials, and meeting anyone who challenges it with physical violence. When the Kohls themselves are attacked by Talon guards, Garrett goes on the offensive, embarking on an investigation that he hopes will rid the Texas High Plains of the intruders once and for all.   Garrett soon discovers that the company has origins in the dark hinterlands of countries across the globe. Using coercion and assassination levied by men from former Russian special operations forces, Talon is working on a highly secretive scheme to commandeer precious U.S. resources. The tit for tat exchange between Talon and the Kohls erupts into a full-scale war when Russian spy, Alexi Orlov, kidnaps Garrett's friend and ally, CIA operative Kim Manning. While Talon may be accustomed to getting its way in many places around the world, they have yet to encounter this rare breed of warrior down in Texas\u2014a man who will fight to the death to protect those that he loves.

It\u2019s an arresting take on magic, science, disaster, and salvation that\u2019s eerily resonant with the fire seasons we find ourselves living through today.\" \u2014Anna North, author of Reese\u2019s Book Club Pick and  New York Times  bestseller  Outlawed     \"This story is darkly funny, deliciously devious and hugely inventive, a magical twist on the allure of the American West and who goes there to seek their fortune.\" \u2014 Good Housekeeping , \"The 30 Best and Most Anticipated Books of 2022 (So Far)\"    The propulsive story of three scheming opportunists\u2014a banker, a conman, and a woman with an extraordinary gift\u2014whose lives collide in the wake of a devastating fire in the American West  For the citizens of Spokane Falls, the fire of 1889 that destroyed their frontier boomtown was no disaster; it was an opportunity. Barton Heydale, manager of the only bank in Spokane Falls, is on the verge of ending his short, unpopular life. But when his city goes up in flames, he sees an ember of hope shimmering on the horizon, headed right for him. As citizens flock to the bank to cash out insurance policies and take out loans, he realizes he can command the power he craves\u2014and it\u2019s not by following the rules. Here is his reason to live.    When Quake Auchenbaucher, a career con man hired to investigate the cause of the fire, arrives in Spokane Falls, he employs his usual shady tactics. But this time, with Washington Territory vying for statehood, the sudden attention to due process jeopardizes Quake\u2019s methods of manipulation.    And then there\u2019s Roslyn Beck, whose uncanny ability to see the future has long driven her to drink, and with whom both Barton and Quake have fallen madly and dangerously in love. She is known as a \u201ccertain kind of woman,\u201d in possession of unique talents and influence, if only she can find the right ways to wield them. As their paths collide, diverge, and collide again, Barton, Quake, and Roslyn come to terms with their own needs for power, greed, and control, leading one to total ruin, one to heartbreak, and one, ultimately, to redemption.    With masterful precision, devious originality, and dark whimsy,  Fire Season  freshly imagines the greed and misogyny of the American West to tell a rollicking, bewitching story about finding purpose in the face of injustice.

Soon after, Lutie comes home from work and discovers a dead man on their kitchen floor and Helen standing above the body, an icepick in hand. She has no doubt Helen killed the man\u2014Dorothy's father\u2014in self-defense, but she knows that will be hard to prove. They decide to leave the body in the street, hoping to disguise it as a victim of the flu. Meanwhile Lutie also worries about her fiance \"over there\". As it happens, his wealthy mother harbors a secret of her own and helps the sisters as the danger deepens, from the murder investigation and the flu. Set against the backdrop of an epidemic that feels all too familiar,  Little Souls  is a compelling tale of sisterhood and of the sacrifices people make to protect those they love most.

The fire forces Elle to move in with her friend Bryn and her motley collection of rescue horses and other animals on the Heaven Can Wait Horse Rescue ranch, where she volunteers. Spending time with the hunky cowboy and his spunky ten-year-old daughter, Mandy, as they rehabilitate the beautiful horses, reminds Elle of all she lost in a car crash years ago. She can't deny the feelings that being close to Brody is stirring in her. As a widower himself, Brody puts all he has into being a good dad for his spirited daughter. He hasn't let women and romance even enter his mind\u2014until he meets Elle. And now, this woman is all he thinks about. Spending time with her is shaking up the calm stasis he had worked so hard to achieve, but he can't seem to stay away. Brody and Elle both know the pain of losing someone they loved, and neither planned ever to let themselves fall in love again. But fate has a way of stepping in, and what started with a small fire now burns hotter than either one could have imagined. Can these two wounded souls take a chance on each other and risk their hearts again?. "

But his life turns upside down when his estranged daughter is placed in his custody after a tragic car accident. Wanting nothing to do with her father, thirteen year-old Allie struggles to adjust to her new life, but Cade hopes the physical therapist he's hired to live at the ranch can give them a start in the right direction. Nora Fisher has had a troublesome last couple of months, but that's nothing compared to what her new patient is going through. Nora will do whatever she can to help Allie and Cade. Her therapy will be hard work for all, but she's grateful Cade is so dedicated to his daughter. And hopefully, the hunky single dad won't be too much of a distraction. Cade and Nora are both in way over their heads, but as they work together, they just might heal each other along the way. "

                "When Sarah Merritt arrives in Dakota Territory in 1876, she steps off the dusty Cheyenne stagecoach determined to start this ramshackle gold-rush town's first newspaper. In Deadwood, her runaway younger sister, Addie, is living and working as domestic help at Mrs. Hossiter's boardinghouse, according to her letters. Five years after Addie's flight from home, Sarah is carrying the sad news that their one remaining parent, newspaper publisher Isaac Merritt, has died. But when Sarah-tall, prim, and nearly a spinster at twenty-five-sets up her father's printing press in the middle of Main Street, she finds herself at loggerheads with Sheriff Noah Campbell. Headstrong and opinionated, with an auburn mustache and grinning gray eyes, he arrests her on the spot. And so begins an enmity between two willful individuals that can change only when they find themselves united in a common goal: to reclaim the Addie that Sarah once knew. But life is never simple. Mrs. Hossiter is more commonly known as Rosie in this bawdy frontier town, and Addie's work is as an \"upstairs girl,\" not an upstairs maid. Addie is furious when Sarah turns up at the bordello-and she tells her proper sister to get out. What could have happened to change Addie so-and what can Sarah do to regain the sweet sister of her youth and bring her home again?. "

                "This program includes supplemental material read by the author.   The thrilling, long-awaited return of the #1  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Revenant.   In 1866, with the country barely recovered from the Civil War, new war breaks out on the western frontier\u2014a clash of cultures between a young, ambitious nation and the Native tribes who have lived on the land for centuries. Colonel Henry Carrington arrives in Wyoming's Powder River Valley to lead the US Army in defending the opening of a new road for gold miners and settlers. Carrington intends to build a fort in the middle of critical hunting grounds, the home of the Lakota. Red Cloud, one of the Lakota's most respected chiefs, and Crazy Horse, a young but visionary warrior, understand full well the implications of this invasion. For the Lakota, the stakes are their home, their culture, their lives. As fall bleeds into winter, Crazy Horse leads a small war party that confronts Colonel Carrington's soldiers with near constant attacks. Red Cloud, meanwhile, seeks to build the tribal alliances that he knows will be necessary to defeat the soldiers. Colonel Carrington seeks to hold together a US Army beset with internal discord. Carrington's officers are skeptical of their commander's strategy, none more so than Lieutenant George Washington Grummond, who longs to fight a foe he dismisses as inferior in all ways. The rank-and-file soldiers, meanwhile, are still divided by the residue of civil war, and tempted to desertion by the nearby goldfields. Throughout this taut saga\u2014based on real people and events\u2014Michael Punke brings the same immersive, vivid storytelling and historical insight that made his breakthrough debut so memorable. As  Ridgeline  builds to its epic conclusion, it grapples with essential questions of conquest and justice that still echo today.    A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt and Company. "

                "An astounding debut that reimagines the classic Western   through the eyes of a Chinese American assassin on a quest to rescue   his kidnapped wife and exact his revenge on her abductors  \"In Tom Lin's novel, the atmosphere of Cormac McCarthy's West, or that of the Coen Brothers'  True Grit , gives way to the phantasmagorical shades of Ray Bradbury, Charles Finney's  The Circus of Dr. Lao , and Katherine Dunn's  Geek Love . A story full of archetypal echoes, yet with a velocity and perspective all its own,    The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu    is a fierce new version of the Westward Dream.\"   \u2014Jonathan Lethem, author of  Motherless Brooklyn  Orphaned as a baby, Ming Tsu, the son of Chinese immigrants, is raised by the notorious leader of a California crime syndicate, who trains him to be his deadly enforcer. But when Ming falls in love with Ada, the daughter of a powerful railroad magnate, and the two elope, he seizes the opportunity to escape to a different life. Soon after, in a violent raid, the tycoon's henchmen kidnap Ada and conscript Ming into service for the Union Pacific Railroad. Battered, heartbroken, and yet defiant, Ming partners with a blind clairvoyant known only as the prophet. Together the two set out to rescue his wife and to exact revenge on the men who destroyed him, aided by a troupe of magic-show performers, some with supernatural powers, whom they meet on the journey. Ming fights his way across the West, settling old scores with a single-minded devotion that culminates in an explosive and unexpected finale.Written with the violent ardor of Cormac McCarthy and the otherworldly inventiveness of Ted Chiang,  The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu  is at once a thriller, a romance, and a story of one man's quest for redemption in the face of a distinctly American brutality.

                "Soon to be a Major Motion Picture    National Book Award Finalist \u2014 Fiction   In the aftermath of the Civil War, an aging itinerant news reader agrees to transport a young captive of the Kiowa back to her people in this exquisitely rendered, morally complex, multilayered novel of historical fiction from the author of Enemy Women that explores the boundaries of family, responsibility, honor, and trust.  In the wake of the Civil War, Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd travels through northern Texas, giving live readings from newspapers to paying audiences hungry for news of the world. An elderly widower who has lived through three wars and fought in two of them, the captain enjoys his rootless, solitary existence.  In Wichita Falls, he is offered a $50 gold piece to deliver a young orphan to her relatives in San Antonio. Four years earlier, a band of Kiowa raiders killed Johanna's parents and sister; sparing the little girl, they raised her as one of their own. Recently rescued by the U.S. army, the ten-year-old has once again been torn away from the only home she knows.  Their 400-mile journey south through unsettled territory and unforgiving terrain proves difficult and at times dangerous. Johanna has forgotten the English language, tries to escape at every opportunity, throws away her shoes, and refuses to act \"civilized.\" Yet as the miles pass, the two lonely survivors tentatively begin to trust each other, forming a bond that marks the difference between life and death in this treacherous land.  Arriving in San Antonio, the reunion is neither happy nor welcome. The captain must hand Johanna over to an aunt and uncle she does not remember\u2014strangers who regard her as an unwanted burden. A respectable man, Captain Kidd is faced with a terrible choice: abandon the girl to her fate or become\u2014in the eyes of the law\u2014a kidnapper himself.

An intimate story of brotherhood, love, sacrifice, and betrayal set against the panoramic backdrop of an early twentieth-century America that eerily echoes our own time, The Cold Millions offers a kaleidoscopic portrait of a nation grappling with the chasm between rich and poor, between harsh realities and simple dreams.   The Dolans live by their wits, jumping freight trains and lining up for day work at crooked job agencies. While sixteen-year-old Rye yearns for a steady job and a home, his older brother, Gig, dreams of a better world, fighting alongside other union men for fair pay and decent treatment. Enter Ursula the Great, a vaudeville singer who performs with a live cougar and introduces the brothers to a far more dangerous creature: a mining magnate determined to keep his wealth and his hold on Ursula.  Dubious of Gig's idealism, Rye finds himself drawn to a fearless nineteen-year-old activist and feminist named Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. But a storm is coming, threatening to overwhelm them all, and Rye will be forced to decide where he stands. Is it enough to win the occasional battle, even if you cannot win the war?  Featuring an unforgettable cast of cops and tramps, suffragists and socialists, madams and murderers, The Cold Millions is a tour de force from a \"writer who has planted himself firmly in the first rank of American authors\" (Boston Globe).

                "The critically acclaimed, bestselling author of News of the World and Enemy Women returns to Texas in this atmospheric story, set at the end of the Civil War, about an itinerant fiddle player, a ragtag band of musicians with whom he travels trying to make a living, and the charming young Irish lass who steals his heart.   In March 1865, the long and bitter War between the States is winding down. Till now, twenty-three-year-old Simon Boudlin has evaded military duty thanks to his slight stature, youthful appearance, and utter lack of compunction about bending the truth. But following a barroom brawl in Victoria, Texas, Simon finds himself conscripted, however belatedly, into the Confederate Army. Luckily his talent with a fiddle gets him a comparatively easy position in a regimental band.  Weeks later, on the eve of the Confederate surrender, Simon and his bandmates are called to play for officers and their families from both sides of the conflict. There the quick-thinking, audacious fiddler can't help but notice the lovely Doris Mary Aherne, an indentured girl from Ireland, who is governess to a Union colonel's daughter.  After the surrender, Simon and Doris go their separate ways. He will travel around Texas seeking fame and fortune as a musician. She must accompany the colonel's family to finish her three years of service. But Simon cannot forget the fair Irish maiden, and vows that someday he will find her again.  Incandescent in its beauty, told in Paulette Jiles's trademark spare yet lilting style, Simon the Fiddler is a captivating, bittersweet tale of the chances a devoted man will take, and the lengths he will go to fulfill his heart's yearning.
