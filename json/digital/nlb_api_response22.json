                "This new edited collection assembles academic essays and intellectual activism equally next to visual essays and artistic interventions and proposes a different concept for fashion research that eschews the traditional logic of academic fashion studies. It features acclaimed designers, artists, curators and theorists whose work investigates the multi-faceted debates on the rise of practice-based research in fashion.   The book sets out to explore current issues in fashion research with a particular focus on both methodology and expansion of the field to encompass overlooked voices and narratives. It has a particular concern with the relationships between theory and practice and with how knowledge is created and disseminated in fashion studies. It is an excellent and really valuable contribution to the field at a point both when fashion studies is expanding and when the fashion industry is at a crucial point of change.   Some of the contributions were originally presented at a symposium hosted by the Austrian Center for Fashion Research 'TALKSHOW: The politics of practice-based fashion research' at Vienna's Museum of Applied Arts, curated by Wally Salner. The symposium brought together a group of fashion scholars, designers, educators and practitioners to explore critical contemporary fashion (research) practices, and to investigate critical fashion knowledge between theory and practice, beyond assumed disciplinary and epistemological boundaries. Many contributions in this volume were initially presented at that symposium, while others are testimonies of international debates that were part of the research activities of the Austrian Center for Fashion Research, a research project funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science Research and Economy, led by Elke Gaugele.   The book is structured into three sections: Fashion Knowledge, Practice-Based Fashion Research, and Sites of Fashion and Politics.\u00a0Contributions look at new forms of fashion knowledge that are forming with and along shifting fashion practices, practice-based fashion research, and sheds light on different sites and entanglements of fashion and politics in distinctive contemporary and historical moments of de/colonization, anti/racism, and anti/globalization.   Elke Gaugele is cultural anthropologist and professor of fashion, styles and contextual design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, Austria. Monica Titton is a sociologist, fashion theorist and senior scientist at the fashion design department of the University of Applied Arts Vienna, Austria. Other contributions are from Elke Bippus, Astrid Engl, Jojo Gronostay, Ruby Hoette, Bianca Koczan, Priska Morger, NCCFN, Wally Salner, Andreas Spiegl, Jos\u00e9 Teunissen, Lara Torres, Carol Tulloch and Maria Ziegelb\u00f6ck   Readers will be academics, practitioners, designers, artists, curators, museums, theoretical scholars, lecturers, practice-based researchers, students and practitioners at all levels in the fields of fashion, textile, art and design.   This new book with its original focus on practice-based research will be useful for a general and academic readership alike, and to all those working within the field of fashion studies, including those with a theoretical focus, fashion practitioners and those working within innovative pockets of the fashion industry.

Then, 18-year-old Daniel Bunting talks about his process for cutting custom small-batch records using polycarbonate discs. Brian Johnson reports on the serendipitous discovery of a cache of 1980s era hardware that jump-started a community around the long defunct NABU computer system. And finally, read a love letter to PC sound cards, and how maker Ian Scott has worked to recreate the unique \"tracker\" sound with a Raspberry Pi Pico.  Plus, 45+ projects including:  Build or 3D print a camera lucida that lets you draw accurately by tracing real life  Install a microcontroller-powered scale on your espresso machine to pull the perfect shot every time  Track your furry, four-legged friends using GPS and your own LoRa network  Add polyphonic sound to your projects the easy way with WVR, a no-code, Wi-Fi audio board  Make a thermal printing photo booth robot out of a vintage TLR camera  Columnist Charles Platt pays tribute after the recent passing of seminal author Don Lancaster, who explained the mysteries of logic chips for generations of DIY hobbyists  Pro tips for making the most of your laser projects with LightBurn software  Build fun, simple stomp rockets using PVC pipe and soda bottles  And more!.

                "Discover the Next Generation of Woodworkers and Designers.    Young designers and makers have more tools than ever to create what their mind can envision. CNC machining, robotics, 3D printing, and ever-advancing software continue to evolve and have become standards in the toolbox of the next generation. To highlight this evolution, the American Woodworkers & Furnishings Suppliers (AWFS) sponsors a student competition with the finalist and winning pieces on display at the biennial AWFS Fair in Las Vegas, NV. With so many pieces of functional art displayed over the past several years, it was time to capture them all in one amazing volume.   In the Fresh Wood Design Book, an inspiring collection of over 120 high-school and post-secondary student projects have been professionally photographed by furniture designer/maker Alan Harp, detailing their creative vision and their beautiful results. The projects in the Fresh Wood Design Book are as unique and inventive as each of the students. Some are reproductions and interpretations of famous styles others are new and igneous designs, but, in the end, all are a noteworthy combination of form and function. Ranging from creative tables and chairs, musical instruments, clocks, and furniture concepts, these projects will inspire students, woodworkers, makers, educators, and industry professionals and will provide a learning or motivational tool for anyone interested in working with wood. Also included is insight from each student discussing the challenges of the design and construction process, the use of new equipment and software, the woodworking techniques, and the complexities of proper finishing. More than a collection of finished pieces, the Fresh Wood Design Book is a glimpse into the future of woodworking and design. "
