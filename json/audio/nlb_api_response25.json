Authentic fun'Tim Harford, Financial Times Best Summer Books 2022 'Brilliantly witty, profoundly illuminating, Alice Sherwood is a master storyteller' Simon Schama 'Thought-provoking and beautifully written' Adrian Wooldridge, Washington Post 'A sweeping and persuasive manifesto ... witty and wide-ranging ... a pleasure'Literary Review 'Terrific ... the sheer breadth of her subject matter is extraordinary'Matthew d'Ancona, Tortoisemedia.com 'Alice Sherwood is the real deal' Marcus du Sautoy 'Fascinating and hugely entertaining' Brian Eno 'Unfailingly compelling and often shocking' Philip Mould, presenter of Fake or Fortune? 'Riveting ... captivating ... a thoroughly enjoyable debut' Financial Times We live in an age when the pursuit of authenticity \u2013 from living our 'best life' to eating artisan food \u2013 matters more and more to us, but where the forces of inauthenticity seem to be taking over. Our world is full of people and products that are not what they seem. We no longer know whether we are talking to a person or a machine. But we can fight back \u2013 and this award-winning book shows us how. Authenticity argues that, although our counterfeit culture is shaped by the most powerful forces of evolution, economics, and technology, we can still come together to reclaim reality. Along the way, we meet the world's greatest impostor, who finally became what he'd pretended to be; the wartime counterfeiter who fooled a nation; nature's most outrageous deceivers; the artist who encouraged people to forge his pictures; the 'authentic' brand that was anything but. But we also meet people living unexpectedly rewarding lives in virtual worlds, and foot soldiers in the 'armies of truth' who are taking down today's conspiracies and cons. Provocative, insightful and original, Authenticity is that once-in-a-generation revelation: a work rich in histories but supremely and urgently of our own time. You'll never think about deception and reality in the same way again. "

                "'Beautifully written, sumptuously illustrated, constantly fascinating'  The Times   On 26 November 1922 Howard Carter first peered into the newly opened tomb of an ancient Egyptian boy-king. When asked if he could see anything, he replied: 'Yes, yes, wonderful things.' In  Tutankhamun's Trumpet , acclaimed Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson takes a unique approach to that tomb and its contents. Instead of concentrating on the oft-told story of the discovery, or speculating on the brief life and politically fractious reign of the boy king, Wilkinson takes the objects buried with him as the source material for a wide-ranging, detailed portrait of ancient Egypt \u2013 its geography, history, culture and legacy. One hundred artefacts from the tomb, arranged in ten thematic groups, are allowed to speak again \u2013 not only for themselves, but as witnesses of the civilization that created them. Never before have the treasures of Tutankhamun been analysed and presented for what they can tell us about ancient Egyptian culture, its development, its remarkable flourishing, and its lasting impact. Filled with surprising insights, unusual details, vivid descriptions and, above all, remarkable objects,  Tutankhamun's Trumpet  will appeal to all lovers of history, archaeology, art and culture, as well as all those fascinated by the Egypt of the pharaohs.

Aged just 15, lonely and bullied by her peers, Elizabeth 'El' Harper felt like an outcast. But then a chance encounter in the street with a friendly woman suddenly brought hope to her world. A friendship between El and this benevolent stranger blossomed, and life began to feel worth living again. As the months passed, El grew more and more distant from her family. One day, she didn't return home to her parents at all ... Snatched is the shocking true story of how a young girl was taken from the streets and groomed into Britain's biggest sex-trafficking ring, all at the hands of a woman. It is also an inspiring account of how trauma can turn vulnerability to strength in the most extraordinary of ways. "

Trapped in a game of rental roulette, stuck living at home as adults, and many on the brink of homelessness, the Irish housing crisis has defined the lives of an entire generation \u2013 and it is set to continue. With housing costs in Ireland the highest in the EU, the property ladder has been kicked from under thousands. So how did we get here ... and how do we break the cycle? In Gaffs, housing expert Rory Hearne urges us to think about the people behind the statistics, and shows us that there is a way towards a future where everyone has access to a home. "

From barrister Harriet Johnson, Enough lays bare the appalling status quo of abuse against women in our society, offering an irrefutable case for why change is needed in policing and justice. Most vitally, it also gives a manifesto for how to get there. With expertise, clear-sightedness and appropriate fury, this book helps us see where women are suffering \u2013 from homicide to domestic abuse to street harassment. It exposes the ways the criminal justice system lets women down \u2013 from officers failing to properly investigate to a lack of consequences when police behaviour is unacceptable, to backlogged courts and the realities of convincing a jury. Addressing misogyny is to everyone's benefit and the answers aren't simple. Enough is the call to arms we can \u2013 and must \u2013 all get behind. "

In The West's Last Chance, Blankley shows how that could happen and how we can prevent it.   What is holding our government back from fighting the Islamist threat to the best of its ability? Why has the United States ignored the lessons of World War II, lessons that could hold the secret to winning the war on terror? Tony Blankley asks the hard questions and gives the straight answers that our country needs to hear. Frightening, provocative, and instructive, The West's Last Chance will change the way we think about\u2014and fight\u2014the war on terror. "

In this brilliantly analytical yet personal book, Sharansky and his longtime friend and advisor Ron Dermer make the case for democracy. The authors put nondemocratic societies under the microscope to reveal the mechanics of tyranny that sustain them, and explain why democracy is essential for our security.   Freedom, Sharansky claims, is rooted in the right to dissent, and societies that do not protect that right can never be reliable partners for peace. But lasting tyranny can be consigned to history's dustbin if the free world stays true to its ideals. The question is not whether we have the power to change the world, but whether we have the will to move beyond Right and Left and start thinking about right and wrong. "

                "In the dark and uncertain days of 1941 and 1942, when Rommel's tanks were sweeping towards Suez, a handful of daring raiders were making history for the Allies. They operated deep behind the German lines, often driving hundreds of miles through the deserts of North Africa. They hid by day and struck by night, destroying aircraft, blowing up ammunition dumps, derailing trains, and killing many times their own number. These were the SAS\u2014Stirling's desert raiders, the brainchild of a deceptively mild-mannered man with a brilliant idea. Small teams of resourceful, highly trained men would penetrate beyond the front lines of the opposing armies and wreak havoc where the Germans least expected it.  The Phantom Major  is the classic account of these desert raids, an amazing tale of courage, impudence, and daring, packed with action and high adventure. An intimate record based on eyewitness accounts, this book still stands as the definitive history of the early years of the SAS. "

Here, drawing on Stratfor's vast information-gathering network, George Friedman delivers the geopolitical story that the mainstream media has been unable to uncover: the startling truth behind America's foreign policy and war effort in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond.   In America's Secret War, Friedman identifies the United States' most dangerous enemies, delves into presidential strategies of the last quarter century, and reveals the real reasons behind the attack of September 11 and the Bush administration's motivation for the war in Iraq. Here, in eye-opening detail, is an insightful picture of today's world that goes far beyond what is reported in the news media. "

                "Powerful and influential kings have long dominated our view of global history, their queens often relegated to the shadows, their influence, deeds and sacrifices unacknowledged and lost in the passing of time. But not anymore... This book chronicles the forgotten queens from across the globe \u2013 those who ruled in their own right, and those who were wives or mothers of reigning kings. All of whom wielded significant power. A smattering of queens, such as Queen Elizabeth I and Catherine the Great of Russia, are known and celebrated, but many more have been glossed over, maligned by historians or dismissed as mere bit-players on the world stage. We are all familiar with the great Roman emperors but what of Queen Zenobia, a rebel queen of the Middle East who took on the Roman Empire? William the Conqueror, the Norman invader of England in 1066, is an iconic figure in history, but how much do you know about his powerful ally and wife Matilda of Flanders? Long Live the Queens rescues these phenomenal women from obscurity, exploring their achievements and deeds, and shedding light on the sacrifices female rulers throughout history have had to make in a patriarchal world. Learn about the trailblazers, game-changers and mighty monarchs who have no business in being forgotten. "

Since his military career has ended, all eyes are on Harry wondering what life, career and love have in store for the maverick prince. This is the inside story of how the cheeky teenager has grown and matured into a respected soldier, charitable fundraiser and national figurehead who still retains his reputation as the most entertaining resident of Buckingham Palace.

Some of those would come at the local level, where McKibben joins forces with a Vermont beekeeper raising his hives as part of the growing trend toward local food. Other solutions would come from a much larger fight against the fossil-fuel industry as a whole.Oil and Honey is McKibben's account of these two necessary and mutually reinforcing sides of the global climate fight&#8212;from the center of the maelstrom and from the growing hive of small-scale local answers. With empathy and passion he makes the case for a renewed commitment on both levels, telling the story of raising one year's honey crop and building a social movement that's still cresting. "

Lured by a seemingly invincible gang culture, he witnessed countless shootings, beatings, and arrests, then watched with increasing fear as that culture claimed friends and family members. Before long, Rodriguez saw a way out of the barrio through education and successfully broke free from years of violence and desperation. Achieving success as an award-winning poet, he was sure the streets would haunt him no more - until his son joined a gang. Rodriguez fought for his child by telling his own story in this vivid memoir. At times heartbreakingly sad and brutal, Always Running is ultimately an uplifting true story, filled with hope, insight, and a hard-learned lesson for the next generation. "

He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: as we enjoy the Internet's bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply? Now, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration yet published of the Internet's intellectual and cultural consequences. Weaving insights from philosophy, neuroscience, and history into a rich narrative, The Shallows explains how the Internet is rerouting our neural pathways, replacing the subtle mind of the book reader with the distracted mind of the screen watcher. A gripping story of human transformation played out against a backdrop of technological upheaval, The Shallows will forever alter the way we think about media and our minds. "

                "Even with the economy feeling a little bit better, there is a real fear that markets will stay down and things won't ever get back to normal. But a few brave voices say that this attitude is just too pessimistic.Capitalism has not failed. And it's not time to just give up&#8212;on free markets or a better tomorrow. History shows that every time the economy was thought to be done, worn out, finished, it bounced back. The economy is not as fragile as the pessimists think. In fact, things are already improving. Even housing is showing signs of life.With It's Not as Bad as You Think, Brian Wesbury, ranked as one of the top economic forecasters by the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, shows you that the future is much brighter than you think. A great confluence of negativity and government mistakes dragged attitudes and the economy down, but this won't last. With this easy-to-follow analysis of tomorrow and guide through yesterday... "

But the full repercussions of China's ascendancy-for itself and the rest of the globe-have been surprisingly little explained or understood. In this far-reaching and original investigation, Martin Jacques offers provocative answers to some of the most pressing questions about China's growing place on the world stage.Martin Jacques reveals, by elaborating on three historical truths, how China will seek to shape the world in its own image. The Chinese have a rich and long history as a civilization-state. Under the tributary system, outlying states paid tribute... "

And while most people believe that the economic collapse is over, the reality is that it has only just begun. That's why he's returned with Crash Proof 2.0.For more than a decade, Schiff has not only observed the U.S. economy, but also helped his clients restructure their portfolios to reflect his outlook. What he sees today is a nation facing a growing economic storm-brought on by bursting bubbles and growing federal, personal, and corporate debt-that will only continue to intensify as the U.S. government refuses to allow market forces to repair the damage.Crash Proof 2.0 picks up right where the first edition-which clearly foresaw the bursting of the real estate bubble, credit crunch, and the insolvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-left off...

In Take Command, Kelly gives you an insider look at how business luminaries with military training, such as Donald Trump, Ross Perot, Marty Evans, Bill Coleman, and Roger Staubach, have achieved success through ten essential principles: duty, impeccability, passion, perseverance, planning, teamwork, loyalty, flexibility, selfless service, and integrity.

Drawing on a profound understanding of geopolitical patterns dating back to the Roman Empire, he shows that we are now, for the first time in half a millennium, experiencing the dawn of a new historical cycle.Friedman predicts that the U.S.-Jihadist war will conclude, to be replaced by a second confrontation with Russia; China will undergo a major internal crisis, and Mexico will emerge as an important world power; there will be at least one global war, but armies will be smaller and wars less deadly; and technology will focus on space, both for military uses and for energy. This book is a compelling, eye-opening portrait of the future. "

Is there a secret organization of top political, economic, military, and religious leaders whose goal is to control the entire planet?The people who answer \"yes\" to such questions are not just extremists; they number in the millions, wear suits, and pay their taxes. News of conspiracies has spread broadly by the Internet, by declassified government reports, by prominent leaders who publicly favor global government, and by interpretations of Bible prophecy. But what is the truth?In this book, Paul Coughlin uncovers the facts about prevalent conspiracy theories and discusses the reasons that so many people believe them to be true. "

The economy collapsed and young men left the city in search of work and security. Desperate to help her family and support her five brothers and sisters at home, Kamela began sewing clothes in her living room. Little did she know then that the tailoring venture she started to help her siblings would be the beginning of a dressmaking business that would create jobs and hope for 100 neighborhood women and mean the difference between survival and starvation for dozens of families like her own.

They're part of the Underdog narrative. Ambridge uses examples from fiction, real life, and popular psychology research to demonstrate how we not only naturally gravitate towards the masterplot narratives, but how we actually use those narratives to manipulate the world around us \u2013 like the addict who uses the Monster plot to paint their illness as something to overcome, or the boxer who relies on the Revenge narrative to motivate themselves to fight their way back after an embarrassing defeat. These masterplots do more for us than to help us understand the world; they're vehicles through which humans have survived.  The Stories of Your Life  shares fascinating lessons about the nature of humanity, the power of psychology and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the way we see ourselves.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014   \"Stories are essential for human beings - they allow us to learn, to connect, to empathize. The best stories follow structures that catalyze and amplify their power. Ambridge expertly decodes and deciphers these masterplots so we can all benefit and grow\"  - Matt Abrahams, author of  Think Faster Talk Smarter  and host of  Think Fast, Talk Smart. "

                "From New York Times bestseller Maureen Callahan, a fierce, character-driven expos\u00e9 of the real Kennedy Curse\u2014the family's generations-long legacy of misogyny, murder, and mayhem\u2014and the women who have paid the price for our obsession with Camelot. For decades, the Kennedy name has been synonymous with wealth, power, and\u2014above all else\u2014integrity. But this carefully constructed veneer hides a dark truth: the Kennedy men's legacy of physical and psychological abuse of women, part of a tradition of toxic masculinity that spans generations and has ruined untold lives. Through scandal after scandal, the family and their defenders have managed to keep this shameful story out of the spotlight. Now, in Ask Not, bestselling journalist Maureen Callahan reveals the Kennedys' hidden history of abuse and exploitation, laying bare their rampant misogyny and restoring women to the center of the dynasty's story: from Jacqueline Onassis and Marilyn Monroe to Carolyn Bessette, Mary Richardson, Rosemary Kennedy, and many others whose names aren't nearly as well known \u2013 but rightfully should be. Drawing on years of fierce reportage and written in electric prose, Ask Not is a long-overdue reckoning with this fabled American family, showing how the Kennedy myth and their raw political power has enabled the clan's many predators while also silencing generations of traumatized women and girls. At long last, Callahan also redirects the spotlight to the women in the Kennedys' orbit, paying homage to those who freed themselves\u2014and giving voice to the countless others who could not do the same.

                "THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTELLER 'Utterly brilliant. We all need to read this book' CLAUDIA WINKLEMAN 'Patrick's book is fascinating and sobering and makes a compelling argument for going back to basics' JOE LYCETT We used to care a lot about our clothes. We didn't have many but those we had were important to us. We'd cherish them, repair them and pass them on. And making them provided fulfilling work for millions of skilled people locally. \ufeffToday the average person has nearly five times as many clothes as they did just 50 years ago. Last year, 100 billion garments were produced worldwide, most made from oil, 30% of which were not even sold, and the equivalent of one bin lorry full of clothing is dumped in landfill or burned every single second. Our wardrobes are full to bursting with clothes we never wear so why do we keep buying more? In this passionate and revealing book about loving clothes but despairing of a broken global system Patrick Grant considers the crisis of consumption and quality in fashion, and how we might make ourselves happier by rediscovering the joy of living with fewer, better-quality things. Weaving in his personal journey through fashion, clothing and the other everyday objects in his life, this is a book that celebrates craftsmanship, making things with care, buying things with thought and valuing everything we own. It explains how rethinking our relationship with clothing could kickstart a thriving new local economy bringing prosperity and hope back to places in our country that have lost out to globalisation, offshore manufacturing and to the madness of price and quantity being the only things that matter. 'Presents a new way of thinking about the things we buy' KEITH BRYMER-JONES. "
