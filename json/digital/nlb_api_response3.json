                "Our intrepid archeologist hardly stops to draw a breath as he tells the stories of five of his expeditions: his discovery of Tin Hinan's tomb in the Hoggar Mountains of the Sahara (1925-26), his excavation of the temple of Jupiter Ammon in Libya (1926-28), a short trip into Tripolitania, Libya (1931), his search for the stone-age Lacandon Indians in Chiapas, Mexico (1932-33), and his quest for King Solomon's mines in Ethiopia (1933-34).     Tin Hanan was the queen of an ancient \"white\" race in north Africa. Prorok and a handful of companions penetrate deep into hostile territory, find the tomb, scoop up the queen's body and a museum's-worth of artifacts, and make their getaway moments before certain death at the hands of the local Taureg warriors. The Tuaregs were fond of burying their enemies up to their necks in the sand and cutting off their eyelids, then applying ants.    But Prorok finds the Tuaregs charming, as well. After a feast which includes stuffed locusts and the tails of snakes and lizards, he is presented to the current queen and her ladies-in-waiting.     \"Here were the real masters of the land! I was astonished to discover the matriarchate still potent in the world; more potent here, even, than it is in the United States, which, until that moment, more closely approached absolute domination by women than any country I had seen.\"     As a mark of courtesy, the Sultan had bestowed three young women upon Prorok, who took him to a party that evening:    \"My three ladies of honour escorted me thither. It was the night of the full moon...The music was plaintive and melancholy at the beginning, but slowly the girls began more ardently to court the men, with little subtlety and considerable charm. I was somewhat troubled by the warmth of the advances made by my three companions, who expected much from the leader of an expedition.\"    Ah, the hardships of the desert trail.    Prorok was known as great believer in Atlantis. He saw hints of the Atlantean culture spread out across Africa, westward along the tropic of Cancer, over the Atlantic to the Yucatan in Mexico, where he takes us next.    This is Villahermosa, Mexico, in the throes of the 1933 revolution. Brigands rule. The governor leads a mob that burns a church and hunts down priests. The Prorok party is hauled along:     \"It was a spectacle unbelievable in its intensity: as though we had landed right in the heart of the French Revolution. Naturally, our camera-man was not too disturbed by the excitement. He was a cinematographer, and he turned steadily away, getting his shots home.\"     This was not a Cook's Tour.     Eventually, the party escapes to the jungle, where they find the mysterious stone-age Lacandon Indians, several lost Mayan cities, and a little gold.    But there is more gold back in Ethiopia, where de Prorok journeys next, in search of King Solomon's mines. This is a different version of the story in Prorok's later book Dead Men Do Tell Tales. The facts are different, but not conflicting, and the account is less expurgated.    They do find the gold, but it belongs to the Mad Sultan Ghogoli, who has hundreds of slaves working the placer deposits in a riverbed.    The expedition later races ahead of a grass fire, falls into the clutches of the Mad Sultan (and into his harem), and then bluffs its way to freedom.    And this is all -- as far as we know -- completely true, as are Prorok's other books: Digging for Lost African Gods (1926), Mysterious Sahara (1929), and Dead Men Do Tell Tales (1942). All are available from The Narrative Press. "

                "In Mysterious Sahara Prorok, a popular archeologist and adventurer of the time, describes his 1925-28 expeditions into north Africa. He goes south from Algeria, across the Sahara, and into the mountains of the Hoggar.    The first chapter of this book is a rather grim but fascinating roll call of early Saharan explorers. The list goes on and on, and almost all of them died horribly. Sometimes it was thirst or hunger, but usually it was at the hands of the Taureg, the giant \"white\" race of the Sahara, in which the men wear veils and are dressed from head to toe in black. Prorok himself, throughout all of his books, keeps up a rather chipper tone, which diverts the reader from the fact that hundreds of explorers died in the very same tracks. This isn't Disneyland.    On his way to find the Taureg, Prorok stops by the temple of Jupiter Ammon, \"where Alexander the Great became a god,\" and then visits the Troglodytes of the Matmatas, who were living Neanderthals.     Somewhere south of the Mountain of Snakes, Prorok finds the Tauregs. They are every bit the tall, silent warriors and bandits he expected them to be. There are about 5,000 of them, living in a feudal system, still carrying the swords of the crusaders, with jewelry and coins from the 17th century. Everywhere Prorok sees links between the Tauregs and medieval Europe -- and Atlantis. He also describes the Tauregs as a near super-race. He saw men run straight at a bar six feet off the ground and clear it with a single jump. His photographer shot 40,000 feet of motion picture film.    But Prorok and his companions never relaxed:    \"There is no question but what one feels the malignity that envelops the hidden personality of the Taureg, and at times it is surprisingly easy to recall the death-dealing spear that traversed Reygasse's tent one silent night, or the tombs of Palat and Douls and Flatters, far out in the sands, or what is far more tragic because of its nearness to me, the passing of some of my own brave comrades, killed by Taureg as I write these lines.\"    In December, 1928, after Prorok's sojourn with the Tauregs, his friends, General Clavery and Captains Debenne, Pasquet, and Resset were massacred on the road to Beni Abbes. A few months later 83 French officers and men were killed by the Tauregs at Ain Yacoub.    One reason Prorok lingered with the Tauregs was that he wanted to find the tomb of their queen, Tin Hinan, which would contain clues to the Taureg's mysterious origin. On October 18, 1927, he found the tomb. He had to excavate in a hurry, however, before the Tauregs realized whose tomb it was. With only a few companions, out of food and almost out of water, he dug. Near the top of the tomb they found Roman coins from the time of Emperor Constantine and other relics from the faraway Mediterranean. Then they found the queen herself, draped with precious jewels.    Just as the Tauregs were about to descend and wipe out the party, reinforcements arrived with food and weapons, and de Prorok escaped with his treasures.     Some of this material is also covered in the author's In Quest of Lost Worlds (1935), but Prorok goes into far better (and different) detail here. Mysterious Sahara is a book you will probably read more than once. Check out Prorok's other books as well: Digging for Lost African Gods (1926), and Dead Men Do Tell Tales (1942). All are available from The Narrative Press. "

                "Byron Khun de Prorok began excavating Carthage and Utica in 1921. Digging for Lost African Gods is an almost lyrical account of archeology, the passage of time, and connections between people from century to century.     \"The twelfth tomb was not rich, but it contained a surprise. The objects were near the motionless hands, telling their tale as plainly as though men from the past had been standing by interpreting for us. The little cubes within reach of the dead man's fingers were a pair of dice! They were made of bone, and identical in shape, size, and numbering, with those used to-day.\"     Digging For Lost African Gods tells us more about the science of archeology, as it was practiced in the early 1920s, than any of Prorok's other books. After Carthage, Prorok went deepsea diving (in the huge old headgear) looking for a sunken city off Djerba. Later, he took a thousand-mile drive in custom-made, six-wheel Renault cars across the Algerian and Libyan deserts to the Hoggar mountains. Some of his techniques were brand new at the time:    This was the first use of the Aeroplane in archaeology...In 1922, we took our first films and photographs from different heights, which resulted in our being able to trace the great submerged walls of ancient Carthage. Flying above the Gulf of Tunis, we were able to film clearly six miles of submerged wall, showing constructions a hundred and fifty yards from the present shore. The aeroplane was piloted by Captain Peletier d'Oisy, the famous French ace, who recently made the phenomenal flight from Paris to Tokyo.     As in all of Prorok's books, there is plenty of hair-raising adventure. At one point Prorok and his camera man face a small army of Mohammedan dancers driven on by priests:    \"Faster, ever faster they revolved, until hysteria caught them, and then, it seemed, hypnotized epilepsy. They foamed at the mouth, and as they reached the climax, priests caught them, and threw them almost at our feet. The fanatics barked like dogs, and handsful of broken glass were presented to the delirious performers by the priests. As a famishing man would relish a handful of crumbs, the glass was chewed by the dancers. After the glass, nails, and after the nails the priests gave knives to the writhing madmen. The nails and knives were thrust through the flesh, and the dancers cried for more. The priests maintained a certain poise throughout it all, increasing the frenzy and leading to more diabolical exhibition step by step. Even while the glass was being chewed, and the nails and knives were thrust into the living bodies of the zealots, the priests procured masses of live scorpions and plied the dancers with them. They might have been shrimps, so eagerly were they devoured.\"    This book makes you want grab and shovel and go...Well, maybe not.     But we're glad Prorok was there, and that he wrote about it. His other books (all available from The Narrative Press) are just as good: Mysterious Sahara (1929), In Quest of Lost Worlds (1935), and Dead Men Do Tell Tales (1942). "

                "An eye-opening argument for a new approach to Iran, from two of America's most informed and influential Middle East expertsLess than a decade after Washington endorsed a fraudulent case for invading Iraq, similarly misinformed and politically motivated claims are pushing America toward war with Iran. Today the stakes are even higher: such a war could break the back of America's strained superpower status. Challenging the daily clamor of U.S. saber-rattling, Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett argue that America should renounce thirty years of failed strategy and engage with Iran--just as Nixon revolutionized U.S. foreign policy by going to Beijing and realigning relations with China.Former analysts in both the Bush and Clinton administrations, the Leveretts offer a uniquely informed account of Iran as it actually is today, not as many have caricatured it or wished it to be. They show that Iran's political order is not on the verge of collapse, that most Iranians still support the Islamic Republic, and that Iran's regional influence makes it critical to progress in the Middle East. Drawing on years of research and access to high-level officials, Going to Tehran explains how Iran sees the world and why its approach to foreign policy is hardly the irrational behavior of a rogue nation. A bold call for new thinking, the Leveretts' indispensable work makes it clear that America must \"go to Tehran\" if it is to avert strategic catastrophe. "

Based on historical documents and interviews with elders, the book is also the epic story of the Wong family as they traverse these challenges with hope and determination, creating an immigrant's legacy in their new home of North America.David H.T.
