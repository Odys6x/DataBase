Author Brian Tracy again explores the seven key elements of goal setting and the 12 steps necessary to set and accomplish goals of any size. Using his trademark simple language and real-life examples, Tracy shows how to do the crucial work of determining one's strengths, values, and true goals. He explains further how to build the self-esteem and confidence necessary for achievement; how to overpower every problem or obstacle; how to overcome difficulties; how to respond to challenges; and how to continue moving forward no matter what happens. The book's revised and updated \"Mental Fitness\" program of character development shows readers how to become the kind of person on the inside who can achieve any goal on the outside. "

They always afraid of offending so they accommodate other people above themselves and adapt their behaviour to suit what they think other people want. Nice people are people-pleasers but they feel compromised and hard done-by a lot of the time. They find it almost impossible to ask for what they want. They expect other people to be as considerate as they are, and think life isn't fair when this doesn't happen. Some nice people live with inner rage, while outside a nice smile is perpetually glued in place. Being too nice can seriously affect your health, wealth and happiness. \"The Nice Factor\" shows you how to stand up for yourself and put your own needs first. Whether at home, work or play, this groundbreaking book will put you back in control of your life. "

The concoctions are supported by meditations, candle work, breath work, and creative visualization techniques to facilitate the purging of stale energy, including guided work for the release and healing of personal issues, such as financial burdens, relationship issues, and grief over departed loved ones. The practical spiritual transformation that can take place is further enhanced by effective journaling exercises for writers of all skill sets, including explicit questions posed to promote self-dialogue. Herbs, oil, chakras, and candle colors are all extensively cross-referenced. "

'#MOJOtweet' by New York Times best-selling author Marshall Goldsmith reveals how we can create Mojo in our lives, maintain it, and recapture it when we need it. In this book, you will explore the vital ingredients for building Mojo--identity, achievement, reputation, and acceptance--and realize the five qualities necessary to do an activity well--motivation, knowledge, ability, confidence, and authenticity. In 140 bite-sized insights (ahas), Goldsmith teaches readers how to discover and nurture these elements within ourselves and how to use them as building blocks for creating our own personal Mojo, the result of which is happiness, reward, meaning, learning, and gratitude.\"--P.

                "The Winner's Way is a guide for approaching every life challenge like an athlete approaches their sport. Dr. Pamela Brill, an Organizational Development Consultant, presents a step-by-step process that begins with the \"three As\" - activation, attitude, and attention - to match challenging situations while creating personal bests at will. Mastering the three A's involves changing your dynamic interaction to the real psychological and chemical reactions taking place in your mind and body at every moment. When these three core elements are activated at precision levels of intensity, you are able to do your best work, on command. The author's methods allow you to tap into your best abilities. At any moment, we're either in the zone for the challenge at hand - or not. Brill provides readers with the tools to reach their personal best in any situation, no matter how stressful the challenge may be.; Throughout the book the author will focus on big picture results, valid data, and compelling personal stories. Through her technique known as Triple A visualization, readers will explore how to turn will into actions that bring desired results.; Readers will also learn how to: Preview adverse challenges realistically; Be prepared with meaningful information, flexible attitude, and emotional centering; Discover the secret to changing your attitude; Pull yourself back up while in a downspin - how to take corrective action in the moment and engage in precision activation; Recognize the sensation of how your particular activation feels when it is aligned as well as when it is bottomed out; Use language as your arsenal, fortress, and medic; \"Debrief\" from each experience identifying what you did well and refocusing on what you'll need to do differently next time; Examine habitual assumptions and challenge them (especially if you're performing below the level you desire); Adjust zonal focus - the power of selective attention.; In addition, readers will find strategies for dealing with performance anxiety, fear of rejection, perceived failure, conflict resolution, stress (in daily life as well as the stress brought on by trauma), thriving in dysfunctional organizations, technology (progress) overload, and more. Brill will show the readers how to develop the habits and activities for daily living that build a reserve for self-reliance. "

                "Shows how children from dysfunctional families manifest co-dependent tendencies as adults, and suggests specific types of psychotherapy. Packed with practical psychology and a strong respect for the spiritual, this book shows readers how to heal co-dependence. Of all the books on the often misunderstood concept of co-dependence, this is probably the clearest, most complete and informative. Charles Whitfield is a frontline clinician, who has been assisting co-dependents in their healing for over twenty years. He has researched the literature on co-dependence, which he summarizes in this widely read book. He sees co-dependence as a way to more accurately describe the painful and confusing part of the human condition. In careful detail he describes just what co-dependence is and what it is not, how it comes about, and how to heal its painful aftereffects. At last, a concise and stimulating book with all the essential features and more about the nearly universal condition of co-dependence. Bestselling author, Dr. Charles Whitfield discusses in detail how co-dependence is a major manifestation of being an adult child of a dysfunctional family, and provides specific psychotherapeutic and recovery methods to help heal its wounds.
