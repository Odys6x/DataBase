                "From Mouse to Mermaid, an interdisciplinary collection of original essays, is the first comprehensive, critical treatment of Disney cinema. Addressing children's classics as well as the Disney affiliates' more recent attempts to capture adult audiences, the contributors respond to the Disney film legacy from feminist, marxist, poststructuralist, and cultural studies perspectives. The volume contemplates Disney's duality as an American icon and as an industry of cultural production, created in and through fifty years of filmmaking. The contributors treat a range of topics at issue in contemporary cultural studies: the performance of gender, race, and class; the engendered images of science, nature, technology, family, and business. The compilation of voices in From Mouse to Mermaid creates a persuasive cultural critique of Disney's ideology. The contributors are Bryan Attebery, Elizabeth Bell, Claudia Card, Chris Cuomo, Ramona Fernandez, Henry A. Giroux, Robert Haas, Lynda Haas, Susan Jeffords, N. Soyini Madison, Susan Miller, Patrick Murphy, David Payne, Greg Rode, Laura Sells, and Jack Zipes. "

These free-form talk pieces-sometimes called talk poems or simply talks-began as improvisations at museums, universities, and poetry centers where Antin was invited to come and think out loud. Serious and playful, they move rapidly from keen analysis to powerful storytelling to passages of pure comedy, as they range kaleidoscopically across Antin's experiences: in the New York City of his childhood and youth, the Eastern Europe of family and friends, and the New York and Southern California of his art and literary career. The author's analysis and abrasive comedy have been described as a mix of Lenny Bruce and Ludwig Wittgenstein, his commitment to verbal invention and narrative as a fusion of Mark Twain and Gertrude Stein. Taken together, these pieces provide a rich oral history of and critical context for the evolution of the California art scene from the 1960s onward.\"-- Provided by publisher. "

Dancers, musicians and puppeteers from Java and Bali are employed internationally, and Indonesian instruments are sampled in commercials. Performing Otherness explores an earlier period when Indonesian arts were internationally scarce, and the performance of a whole troupe from Java or Bali could spark an artistic revolution. Focusing on the late colonial period and the transition to independence, Performing Otherness encompasses the work and lives of dozens of performing artists (including Mata Hari, Artaud and Ruth St Denis) to delve into the international and wide-ranging influence of Javanese and Balinese performance. This book presents a fascinating critical history of representations of Java and Bali in Europe, the US, India and elsewhere around the world: Javanese 'temple dance' and wayang golek puppetry in fin-de-si\u0308cle Vienna; music and dance programmes mixing Gershwin and Java in jazz-age New York; a summer school for dancers in southern France run by a Javanese aristocrat; an arena spectacle at the foothills of the Himalayas inspired by Javanese shadow puppets; a gamelan performing nightly in a Chicago nightclub.

Between the two world wars they were a phenomenon in which working-class people engaged in emblematic struggles for survival. Battling to outlast other contestants, the dancers hoped to become notable. There was crippling exhaustion and anguish among the contenders, but ultimately it was the coupling of authentic pain with staged displays that made dance marathons a national craze. Within the well-controlled space of theatre they revealed actual life's unpredictability and inconsistencies, and, indeed, the frightful aspects of social Darwinism. In this grotesque theatrical setting we see also a horrifying metaphor - the ailing nation grappling with difficult times. "

Between the two world wars they were a phenomenon in which working-class people engaged in emblematic struggles for survival. Battling to outlast other contestants, the dancers hoped to become notable. There was crippling exhaustion and anguish among the contenders, but ultimately it was the coupling of authentic pain with staged displays that made dance marathons a national craze. Within the well-controlled space of theatre they revealed actual life's unpredictability and inconsistencies, and, indeed, the frightful aspects of social Darwinism. In this grotesque theatrical setting we see also a horrifying metaphor - the ailing nation grappling with difficult times. "

Subdivided into separate chambers for music, theater, the visual arts, literature, film, radio, and the press, this organization encompassed several hundred thousand professionals and influenced the activities of millions of amateur artists and musicians as well. Alan Steinweis focuses on the fields of music, theater, and the visual arts in this first major study of Nazi cultural administration, examining a complex pattern of interaction among leading Nazi figures, German cultural functionaries, ordinary artists, and consumers of culture. One of the most persistent generalizations to emerge from research on Nazi Germany is the notion of a German artistic and cultural establishment at the mercy of a totalitarian regime determined to mobilize the arts for its own ideological purposes. Steinweis argues that this generalization obscures a more complex reality. It overlooks continuities in the agenda of the German cultural establishment from the Weimar Republic through the Nazi period and presupposes a clearer distinction than actually existed between officialdom and the cultural elite, thereby overestimating the degree to which policy affecting artists originated outside the artistic world. Steinweis describes the political, professional, and economic environment in which German artists were compelled to function and explains the structure of decision making, showing in whose interest cultural policies were formulated. He discusses such issues as work creation, social insurance, minimum wage statutes, and certification guidelines, all of which were matters of high priority to the art professions before 1933 as well as after the Nazi seizure of power. By elucidating the economic and professional context of cultural life, Steinweis also contributes to an understanding of the response of German artists to cultural Gleichschaltung, or \"coordination,\" and helps to explain the widespread acquiescence of German artists to artistic censorship and racial and political \"purification.\" "

                "Today one finds many non-Indonesians studying gamelan. Dancers, musicians and puppeteers from Java and Bali are employed internationally, and Indonesian instruments are sampled in commercials. Performing Otherness explores an earlier period when Indonesian arts were internationally scarce, and the performance of a whole troupe from Java or Bali could spark an artistic revolution. Focusing on the late colonial period and the transition to independence, Performing Otherness encompasses the work and lives of dozens of performing artists (including Mata Hari, Artaud and Ruth St Denis) to delve into the international and wide-ranging influence of Javanese and Balinese performance. This book presents a fascinating critical history of representations of Java and Bali in Europe, the US, India and elsewhere around the world: Javanese 'temple dance' and wayang golek puppetry in fin-de-si\u0308cle Vienna; music and dance programmes mixing Gershwin and Java in jazz-age New York; a summer school for dancers in southern France run by a Javanese aristocrat; an arena spectacle at the foothills of the Himalayas inspired by Javanese shadow puppets; a gamelan performing nightly in a Chicago nightclub.

As evidenced by the professions in this anthology, the scope of work within the arts and culture sector is diverse, from backgrounds such as history, communications, management, economics, law, science, arts, psychology and entertainment. Beyond theory, the anthology offers an authentic voice of real and lived experiences of the go-to people, their personal role in heritage development, and their thoughts and insights on our, albeit developing, arts scene since independence\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "Ten years ago, a technological revolution swept through cinemas around the world, as analogue projectors were replaced with digital equipment. It was not just the plastic medium of film that was removed from projection boxes during this transformation; most cinemas took this opportunity to also evict the human projectionists who were hitherto in charge of screenings. Projectionists had been hidden from the sight of audiences for most of the history of photographic moving image projection, and their redundancies went largely unnoticed and unremarked upon.  This book focuses attention on what has been happening behind film spectators' heads for the past 130 years, and attempts to write the history of cinema in Britain from the perspective of its habitually overlooked and undervalued projectionists, beginning in the silent era and continuing to the present day. Drawing upon extensive archival research and lengthy interviews with former projectionists, it documents the key facets and challenges of their work, and how these evolved in response to previous waves of significant technological change. It evaluates how projectionists helped to design and maintain key aesthetic characteristics of the 20th century big screen experience. It shows how the institution of cinema in Britain has been historically underpinned by the harsh exploitation of projectionists by many employers, detailing inadequate wage levels and poor working conditions that formerly provoked government investigation, and explaining why these problems were never successfully ameliorated by trade unions. It also charts in depth the recent fateful transition to digital projection, delineating how and why projectionists were so swiftly and ruthlessly consigned to the past, and assessing whether this form of entertainment should be considered diminished by their super session.

                "The Festival Cities of Edinburgh and Adelaide  examines how these cities' world-famous arts events have shaped and been shaped by their long-term interaction with their urban environments. While the Edinburgh International Festival and Adelaide Festival are long-established, prestigious events that champion artistic excellence, they are also accompanied by the two largest open-access fringe festivals in the world. It is this simultaneous staging of multiple events within Edinburgh's Summer Festivals and Adelaide's Mad March that generates the visibility and festive atmosphere popularly associated with both places. Drawing on perspectives from theatre studies and cultural geography, this book interrogates how the Festival City, as a place myth, has developed in the very different local contexts of Edinburgh and Adelaide, and how it is challenged by groups competing for the right to use and define public space. Each chapter examines a recent performative event in which festival debates and controversies spilled out beyond the festival space to activate the public sphere by intersecting with broader concerns and audiences. This book forges an interdisciplinary, comparative framework for festival studies to interrogate how festivals are embedded in the social and political fabric of cities and to assess the cultural impact of the festivalisation phenomenon.

                "The definitive, authorized, and first-ever biography of Terry Allen, the internationally acclaimed visual artist and iconoclastic songwriter who occupies an utterly unique position straddling the disparate, and usually distant, worlds of conceptual art and country music. \u00a0 \u00a0   \u201cPeople tell me it\u2019s country music,\u201d Terry Allen has joked, \u201cand I ask, \u2018Which country?\u2019\u201d For nearly sixty years, Allen\u2019s inimitable art has explored the borderlands of memory, crossing boundaries between disciplines and audiences by conjuring indelible stories out of the howling West Texas wind.  \u00a0  In  Truckload of Art , author Brendan Greaves exhaustively traces the influences that shaped Allen\u2019s extraordinary life, from his childhood in Lubbock, Texas, spent ringside and sidestage at the wrestling matches and concerts his father promoted, to his formative art-school years in incendiary 1960s Los Angeles, and through subsequent decades doggedly pursuing his uncompromising artistic vision. With humor and critical acumen, Greaves deftly recounts how Allen built a career and cult following with pioneering independent records like  Lubbock (on everything)  (1979)\u2014widely considered an archetype of alternative country\u2014and multiyear, multimedia bodies of richly narrative, interconnected art and theatrical works, including  JUAREZ  (ongoing since 1968), hailed as among the most significant statements in the history of American vernacular music and conceptual art.  \u00a0  Drawing on hundreds of revealing interviews with Allen himself, his family members, and his many notable friends, colleagues, and collaborators\u2014from musicians like David Byrne and Kurt Vile to artists such as Bruce Nauman and Kiki Smith\u2014and informed by unprecedented access to the artist\u2019s home, studio, journals, and archives, Greaves offers a poetic, deeply personal portrait of arguably the most singularly multivalent storyteller of the American West.

                "Since the 1920s, fashion has played a central role in Hollywood. As the movie-going population consisted largely of women, studios made a concerted effort to attract a female audience by foregrounding fashion. Magazines featured actresses like Jean Harlow and Joan Crawford bedecked in luxurious gowns, selling their glamour as enthusiastically as the film itself. Whereas actors and actresses previously wore their own clothing, major studios hired costume designers and wardrobe staff to fabricate bespoke costumes for their film stars. Designers from a variety of backgrounds, including haute couture and art design, were offered long-term contracts to work on multiple movies. Though their work typically went uncredited, they were charged with creating an image for each star that would help define an actor both on- and off-screen. The practice of working long-term with a single studio disappeared when the studio system began unraveling in the 1950s. By the 1970s, studios had disbanded their wardrobe departments and auctioned off their costumes and props. In  Designing Hollywood: Studio Wardrobe in the Golden Age , Christian Esquevin showcases the designers who dressed Hollywood's stars from the late 1910s through the 1960s and the unique symbiosis they developed with their studios in creating iconic looks. Studio by studio, Esquevin details the careers of designers like Vera West, who worked on Universal productions such as  Phantom of the Opera  (1925),  Dracula  (1931), and  Bride of Frankenstein  (1931); William Travilla, the talent behind Marilyn Monroe's dresses in  Gentleman Prefer Blondes  (1953) and  The Seven Year Itch  (1955); and Walter Plunkett, the Oscar-winning designer for film classics like  Gone with the Wind  (1939) and  An American in Paris  (1951). Featuring black and white photographs of leading ladies in their iconic looks as well as captivating original color sketches,  Designing Hollywood  takes the reader on a journey from drawing board to silver screen.

                "Stitching La Mode: Patterns and Dressmaking from Fashion Plates of 1785-1795 brings to life women's unique and extravagant fashions of 1785-1795 in a beautifully illustrated and accessible way.  The book consists of scaled patterns directly based on original French, German and English fashion plates drafted according to period-accurate shapes. The patterns encompass the full look presented in each fashion plate from garments to accessories. These are accompanied by a color image of the corresponding fashion plate, straightforward, illustrated directions for recreating the outfits, information on the material used and modelled reproductions of each plate to demonstrate what they would look like in \"real life\". The book focuses on unique styles often seen in fashion plates but rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 patterned before, making this a fresh and exciting yet historically accurate take on late eighteenth-century fashion.   Stitching La Mode  significantly expands the understanding of transitional fashions from the late eighteenth century with concrete, physical examples of styles, perfectly suited for costume technicians and makers, costume historians and hobby costumers and re-enactors.

'Determined, focused and full of heart - this book encapsulates all that has made Sara Davies the powerhouse she is.' Giovanna Fletcher   From student halls to Dragons Den (and Strictly Come Dancing!), this is Sara Davies MBE's story of building her multi-million-pound business from scratch and why we can all make it big.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  Sara Davies is the queen of crafts. Whilst working as an intern in a small company, Sara noticed a gap in the industry and decided to pursue it. By the time she left university, she was running a business with a half million-pound turnover from her student bedroom. When she became the youngest of BBC 1's iconic Dragons, that turnover was \u00a325 million. Today, she is one of Britain's biggest business names. In her first book - as full of warmth, wit and wisdom as she is - Sara shares what it took to get there: from manning factories overnight with her mam and dad to hitting the trade shows of Las Vegas alone, armed with little more than ambition and passion.  We Can All Make It  chronicles everything from what she looks for in a business investment to how she manages to find time to enjoy family life while running an empire. From the buzz of witnessing your latest product sell out, dancing the cha cha as you broadcast live to 96 million American homes, thriving after lockdown to being at the head of the biggest tables, Sara's unique storytelling answers all the questions for women in business today.  Praise for Sara Davies  'A business whizz' -   Radio Times   'A brilliant read.'  Steph McGovern  'Page-turning, inspiring' -  Gethin Jones  'She is amazing!' -  Alison Hammond  'Energy, focus, commitment: she's relentless!' -  Peter Jones. "

For over half a century he urged workers to join unions, which he called, paradoxically, \"the Capitalism of the Proletariat,\" because as capitalists try to get as much labor as possible from workers while paying them as little as possible, unions try to gain as high wages as possible from employers while working as little as possible. He opposed general strikes as destined to fail, since owners can hold out longer than workers, whose unions have less money to support them during strikes. This book offers background on major strikes in and before Shaw's time \u2014including the Colorado Coalfield War and the Dublin Lockout, both in 1913\u2014before analyzing the causes, day-by-day events and consequences of Britain's 1926 General Strike. It begins and ends with examinations of their and Shaw's relevance to actions on unions and strikes in our own time. "

                "The early essays of the most influential French film critic of the post-68 period.   The Footlights  (1983) was the first book by Serge Daney, a film critic admired in his lifetime by Gilles Deleuze and Jean-Luc Godard and recognized since his premature death in 1992 as the most important French writer on film after Andr\u00e9 Bazin.  The Footlights  stands apart in Daney\u2019s body of work as the only collection of his essays he conceived of as a book, organizing his seminal pieces from  Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma  by theme and linking them with original texts that reflect in a personal voice on the doubts, battles, and illuminations of a generation of film lovers inspired by the explorations of Lacanian theory and roused by the collective aspirations of Maoist dogma. In pieces on fellow travelers Godard and Straub/Huillet, on films ranging from Pasolini\u2019s  Sal\u00f3  to Spielberg\u2019s  Jaws , and on the difference between film language and television discourse, Daney offers a definitive portrait of an era of radical hope and disappointment.

I learned a tremendous amount, as will most readers, and\u00a0 Bernard \u00a0 Shaw and the Censors \u00a0will doubtless be the last word on the topic.\"  - Michel Pharand, former editor of\u00a0 SHAW: The Journal of Bernard Shaw Studies  and\u00a0author of  Bernard Shaw and the French  (2001).\u00a0  \"This book shows us a new side of Shaw and his complicated relationships to the powerful mechanisms of stage and screen censorship in the long twentieth century.\"     -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0Lauren Arrington, Professor of English, Maynooth University, Ireland  A fresh view of Shaw versus stage and screen censors, this book describes Shaw as fighter and failure, whose battles against censorship \u2013 of his plays and those of others, of his works for the screen and those of others \u2013 he sometimes won but usually lost. We forget  usually , because ultimately he prevailed and because his witty reports of defeats are so buoyant, they seem to describe triumphs. We think of him as a celebrity, not an outsider; as a classic, not one of the avant-garde, of which Victorians and Edwardians were intolerant; as ahead of his time, not of it, when he was called \"disgusting,\" \"immoral\", and \"degenerate.\" Yet it took over three decades and a world war before British censors permitted a public performance of  Mrs Warren's Profession . We remember him as an Academy Award winner for  Pygmalion , not as an author whose dialogue censors required deletions for showings in the United States. Scrutinizing the powerful stage and cinema censorship in Britain and America, this book focuses on one of its most notable campaigners against them in the last century. "

                "From longtime fashion director, consultant, media personality, and author, Hal Rubenstein, comes a lush, full color, illustrated guide to the most influential fashion on television from the 1950s to today, revealing the surprising ways our favorite shows have significantly reflected and often shaped the way we dress.    No other medium has shaped our lives as thoroughly and consistently as television. Since its advent in the 1950s, television has served as a portal for discovering culture, initiating trends, and altering shared perceptions. Yet as Hal Rubenstein contends, television has done much more; its most dramatic, lasting, and effective influence can be found in our closets. Our most popular and lasting fashion trends and hallmarks of personal style haven't come from runways or magazines, but from what's on TV. For decades television has served as a personal stylist, showing us how others dress and defining what we should be wearing.  From Mary Tyler Moore's capri pants on The Dick van Dyke Show and Emma Peel's dominatrix jumpsuit on The Avengers to Olivia Pope's trademark white trench on Scandal and Don Drapers' grey sharkskin suits on Mad Men Dressing the Part is a rich history of popular American fashion and culture in the modern age. In this gorgeous compendium, the longtime fashion director and expert identifies the most stylish television shows of the past 70 years, highlighting the ways they have affected and often inspired ordinary Americans' wardrobes. Combining his decades of fashion expertise and insider knowledge with lush photographs, archival sketches, fascinating interviews with over two dozen of television's best costume designers, commentary from showrunners and co-stars, and little-known backstories, Rubenstein reveals with insight and wit how television has shaped everyday fashion, guiding and often elevating how we dress.  Illustrated with over 175 gorgeous, full-color photographs, Dressing the Part is an extraordinary survey of our most beloved shows and their most enduring impact on style, shining a spotlight on the most innate human characteristics of all\u2014how we imitate and then adapt what we enjoy seeing on others.

                "A collection of greatest film reviews from a critic who \"understands how to pop the hood of a movie and tell us how it runs\" (Steven Spielberg).  Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning film critic Roger Ebert wrote movie reviews for the  Chicago Sun-Times  for over forty years. His wide knowledge, keen judgment, and sharp sense of humor made him America's most celebrated film critic\u2014the only one to have a star dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His hit TV show,  At the Movies , made ''two thumbs up'' a coveted hallmark in the industry. From  The Godfather  to  GoodFellas , from  Cries and Whispers  to  Crash , the reviews in  Awake in the Dark  span some of the most exceptional periods in film history, from the dramatic rise of rebel Hollywood and the heyday of the auteur, to the triumph of blockbuster films such as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, to the indie revolution. The extraordinary interviews included capture Ebert engaging with such influential directors as Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Werner Herzog, and Ingmar Bergman, as well respected actors as diverse as Robert Mitchum, James Stewart, Warren Beatty, and Meryl Streep. Also gathered here are some of his most admired esssays, among them a moving appreciation of John Cassavetes and a loving tribute to the virtues of black-and-white films. A treasure trove for film buffs,  Awake in the Dark  is a compulsively readable chronicle of film since the late 1960s. \"[Ebert] has a keen understanding of the way [movies] work.\" \u2014Martin Scorsese \"[Ebert's] criticism shows a nearly unequalled grasp of film history and technique.\" \u2014A.O. Scott,  New York Times. "

Capturing an era\u2014and preserving the stories they have told their daughters, their mentees, their husbands, and their friends\u2014a dozen women Imagineers have written personal stories from their decades designing and building the Disney world-wide empire of theme parks. Illustrated with the women's personal drawings and photos in addition to archival Imagineering images, the book represents a broad swath of Imagineering's creative disciplines during a time of unprecedented expansion. Intertwined with memories of Disney legends are glimpses of what it takes behind the scenes to create a theme park, and the struggles unique to women who were becoming more and more important, visible and powerful in a workplace that was overwhelmingly male. Each chapter is unique, from a unique Imagineer's perspective and experience. These women spent their careers telling stories in three dimensions for the public. Now they've assembled their stories in print, with the hope that their experiences will continue to entertain and illuminate. "

It took 75 years for American Ballet Theatre to have its first African American female principal dancer, Misty Copeland. When TaKiyah Wallace-McMillian went to enroll her three-year-old daughter into her first ballet class, she immediately saw this lack of diversity and representation\u2014even on her local dance studio\u2019s website. Within weeks TaKiyah, a freelance photographer, began shooting a project she called Brown Girls Do Ballet, which eventually became an Instagram hit and a nonprofit organization that provides resources, mentorship, inspiration, and encouragement to young dancers of color worldwide.  For her first book,  The Color of Dance , TaKiyah traveled around the United States seeking out dancers of African, Asian, East Indian, Hispanic, and Native American ancestry. With these more than 190 breathtaking images of colorful ballerinas of all ages and levels, both amateur and professional, TaKiyah gives a voice to dancers who have been underrepresented for too long.  With dozens of quotes throughout from ballerinas themselves,  The Color of Dance  redefines what this classically Eurocentric art form has looked like for centuries and will inspire dancers\u2014and all of us\u2014to pursue our dreams no matter what barriers are put in front of us.

                "From the author of  Generation Friends,  featuring brand-new interviews with Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, a surprising, incisive, and often hilarious book about the film that changed comedy,  Anchorman.    It\u2019s been nearly twenty years since Ron Burgundy burst into movie fans\u2019 lives, reminding San Diego to \u201cstay classy\u201d while lampooning a time gone by\u2014although maybe not as far gone as we might think? In  Kind of a Big Deal , comedy historian Saul Austerlitz tells the history of how  Anchorman  was developed, written, and cast, and how it launched the careers of future superstars like Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, and Paul Rudd, also setting the stage for a whole decade of comedy to come and influencing films like  The\u00a040-Year-Old Virgin, Talladega Nights, Knocked Up, Superbad , and so many more.  But  Kind of a Big Deal  isn\u2019t only a celebration of  Anchorman \u2014it\u2019s also a cultural analysis of the film\u2019s significance as a sly commentary on feminism, the media, fragile masculinity, 1970s nostalgia, and more. Featuring brand-new interviews with stars such as Will Ferrell, director Adam McKay, and other key players, the book includes insider commentary alongside updated pop-culture analysis. And it also shares surprising stories and facts: from the film\u2019s original conception as a plane crash/cannibal comedy mashup to the surprising, real-life newscaster who inspired the character of Veronica.  Overall, this is a celebration of a movie that millions love\u2014but it\u2019s also an unsparing look back at what has and hasn\u2019t changed, since the 1970s and since 2004. Perfect for fans of the film and anyone who cares about comedy today,  Kind of a Big Deal  proves that the movie was, and is, exactly that. "

From the slapstick comedy of Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel, the surrealism of Spike Milligan and Monty Python, and the golden age of political incorrectness helmed by Benny Hill, to the alternative scene that burst forth following the punk movement, the hedonistic joy of Absolutely Fabulous, the lacerating scorn of Jimmy Carr, Ricky Gervais, and Jo Brand and the meteoric rise of socially conscious stand up today: comedy can be many things, and it is a cultural phenomenon has come to define Britain like few others. In Different Times, David Stubbs charts the superstars that were in on the gags, the unsung heroes hiding in the wings and the people who ended up being the butt of the joke. Comedians and their work speak to and of their time, drawing upon and moulding Britons' relationship with their national history, reflecting us as a people, and, simply, providing raucous laughs for millions of people around the world. Different Times is a joyous, witty and insightful paean to British comedy. "

                "A Place in My Heart  is a many-splendored thing. It is a listicle. It is a celebration of the power of storytelling. It is also an account of a life lived in the Bollywood trenches. National Award-winning author, journalist and film critic Anupama Chopra writes about fifty films, artistes and events that have left an indelible impression on her and shaped her twenty-five-year-long career. Shah Rukh Khan is here. So are  Super Deluxe  and the Cannes Film Festival.  A Place in My Heart  is a blend of recommendations and remembrances, nostalgia and narratives. It is a smorgasbord of cinematic delights, written, as Marie Kondo would say, to 'spark joy.' Above all, it is a testament to Chopra's enduring love for all things cinema. "

                "In this official centennial history of the greatest studio in Hollywood, unforgettable stars, untold stories, and rare images from the Warner Bros. vault bring a century of entertainment to vivid life.   The history of Warner Bros.  is not just the tale of a legendary film studio and its stars, but of classic Hollywood itself, as well as a portrait of America in the last century. It\u2019s a family story of Polish-Jewish immigrants\u2014the brothers Warner\u2014who took advantage of new opportunities in the burgeoning film industry at a time when four mavericks could invent ways of operating, of warding off government regulation, and of keeping audiences coming back for more during some of the nation's darkest days.    Innovation was key to their early success. Four years after its founding, the studio revolutionized moviemaking by introducing sound in  The Jazz Singer  (1927). Stars and stories gave Warner Bros. its distinct identity as the studio where tough guys like Humphrey Bogart and strong women like Bette Davis kept people on the edge of their seats. Over the years, these acclaimed actors and countless others made magic on WB\u2019s soundstages and were responsible for such diverse classics as  Casablanca ,  A Streetcar Named Desire ,  A Star Is Born ,  Bonnie & Clyde ,  Malcolm X ,  Caddyshack ,  Purple Rain , and hundreds more.  It\u2019s the studio that put noir in film with  The Maltese Falcon  and other classics of the genre, where the iconic Looney Tunes were unleashed on animation, and the studio that took an unpopular stance at the start of World War II by producing anti-Nazi films. Counter-culture hits like  A Clockwork Orange  and  The Exorcist  carried the studio through the 1970s and '80s. Franchise phenomena like Harry Potter, the DC universe, and more continue to shape a cinematic vision and longevity that is unparalleled in the annals of film history. These stories and more are chronicled in this comprehensive and stunning volume.    Copyright \u00a9 2023 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. "
