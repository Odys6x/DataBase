                "Operation Biting was one of the most thrilling British commando raids of World War II, and probably the most successful. In February 1942 RAF intelligence was baffled by a newly-identified radar network on the coast of Nazi-occupied Europe, codenamed W\u00fcrzburg. The brilliant scientist Dr RV Jones proposed an assault to capture key components. The nearest accessible enemy set stood upon a steep cliff at Bruneval in Normandy. Winston Churchill enthused, as did Lord Louis Mountbatten, chief of Combined Operations. A company of the newly-formed Airborne Forces was committed to the operation, which took place on the night of 27/28 February. Amid heavy snow 120 men landed, some of whom were misdropped almost two miles from their objective. They nonetheless launched the assault, dismantled the German radar, and after three nail-biting hours in France and a fierce battle with Wehrmacht defenders, escaped in the nick of time by landing-craft across stormy seas to Portsmouth. Max Hastings recounts this cliffhanging tale in a wealth of previously unchronicled detail. He portrays its remarkable personalities: the 'boffin' RV Jones; the peacock Mountbatten; the troubled husband of Daphne Du Maurier, Gen. 'Boy' Browning, who commanded the Airborne Division; 'Colonel Remy', the French secret agent whose men reconnoitered Bruneval at mortal risk; Major John Frost, who led the paras into action; Charlie Cox, the little RAF technician who stripped the W\u00fcrzburg and became an unexpected hero; Wing-Commander Charles Pickard, a legendary bomber pilot who led the drop squadron. Seldom have so many fascinating personalities been brought together to fulfil a mission that became a front-page triumph in a season of British defeats. Recounted in Hastings' familiar best-selling blend of top-down and bottom-up action detail, Operation Biting tells a story that has become almost forgotten yet deserves to rank among the epic tales of courage and daring that took place in the greatest conflict in history.

                "The Number One Bestseller  ______________  For over thirty years, David McDonald worked in Ireland's biggest prisons. This is his story.  As a young officer, McDonald got a baptism of fire in Mountjoy. In 1989 it was a chaotic, pungent and overcrowded place, and the approach to keeping order was primitive. Returning to his hometown two years later, he entered Portlaoise Prison, which - due to the presence of IRA and other subversive prisoners - was then the most secure prison in Europe. McDonald was amazed to discover the power of these subversives within the prison. Portlaoise, and later the new Midlands Prison, were also where Ireland's emerging class of serious gangsters were housed. McDonald dealt with notorious household names like John Gilligan, Christy Kinahan, Brian Meehan, Dessie O'Hare and, more recently, killers like Graham Dwyer, in his average working day. McDonald shares vivid accounts of the constant war of attrition between prisoners and prison authorities over the smuggling of contraband like drugs and phones. His work in a specialist security unit trying to stop this trafficking sometimes brought him into conflict with his bosses. He also questioned aspects of an often brutal and under-resourced system. Ultimately, concerns about poor handling of key issues led to him becoming a whistle-blower. In  Unlocked , McDonald brilliantly describes the boredom, the constant tension and flashpoints of extreme violence, and the moments of comedy, tragedy and surprising humanity that are part and parcel of working in prisons. Written with the help of award-winning journalist and author, Mick Clifford, it is a jaw-dropping and authentic account of life in the toughest of workplaces. _____________ 'An extraordinary behind-the-scenes look at the hidden world of Irish prisoners . . . fascinating' Brendan O'Connor 'Cracking' Matt Cooper.

Sunday Times    'Absolutely superb. 5 stars for sheer readability alone. Her Honour entertains as she educates us about murder, about the law and about how we human beings are shaped as we create the culture we live with.'   PHILIPPA PERRY, author of THE BOOK YOU WISH YOUR PARENTS HAD READ   ___________________________________________________________________________________    'Every day in the UK lives are suddenly, brutally, wickedly taken away. Victims are shot or stabbed. Less often they are strangled or suffocated or beaten to death. Rarely they are poisoned, pushed off high buildings, drowned or set alight. Then there are the many who are killed by dangerous drivers, or corporate gross negligence. There are a lot of ways you can kill someone. I know because I've seen most of them at close quarters.'   High-profile murder cases all too often grab our attention in dramatic media headlines - for every unlawful death tells a story. But, unlike most of us, a judge doesn't get to turn the page and move on. Nor does the defendant, or the family of the victim, nor the many other people who populate the court room. And yet, each of us has a vested interest in what happens there. And while most people have only the sketchiest idea of what happens inside a Crown Court, any one of us could end up in the witness-box or even in the dock. With breath-taking skill and deep compassion, the author describes how cases unfold and illustrates exactly what it's like to be a murder trial judge and a witness to human good and bad. Sometimes very bad. The fracture lines that run through our society are becoming harder and harder to ignore. From a unique vantage point, the author warns that we do so at our peril. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 'The most exceptional book I have read in a long time.'  CLARE MACKINTOSH  'A very rare gem. written with authority, humility and compassion. Compellingly clever and sharply honest.'  PROFESSOR DAME SUE BLACK, author of ALL THAT REMAINS  'Riveting, thought-provoking, and very, very entertaining. I loved it.'  RODDY DOYLE  'Will make you question all the fundamentals that you've come to take for granted about offenders, the crimes that they commit - especially murder - and the punishment they deserve. A page turner that will leave you wanting to know more.'  EMERITUS PROFESSOR DAVID WILSON, author of MY LIFE WITH MURDERERS  The instant  Sunday Times  bestseller, March 2023. "

                "In the second volume of the Police Diaries series,  Khaki on Broken Wings , former director general of police Amod K. Kanth untangles some of the most sensational and heinous crimes that dominated national headlines. Deploying his deep knowledge of real world crimes committed by the rich and the powerful, Kanth lays bare the loopholes within the criminal justice system, comprising the police, whose investigations are crucial to any prosecution, the courts and lawyers, and the prison and correctional services, which they exploit ruthlessly.  Among the many gripping stories Kanth narrates is the story of the mafia lord Romesh Sharma, who terrorised his targets to extort properties worth hundreds of crores and thwarted investigations using his access to powerful people in the political and corporate world. He also recounts how 'Bikini Killer' Charles Sobhraj managed a sensational escape from the high-security Tihar Jail in Delhi and the complex story behind the fight for justice in the BMW hit-and-run case that left several people dead.  Kanth passionately argues for the radical restructuring of the criminal justice system so that the police and the justice system are able to protect the poor, the needy and the helpless instead of being subservient to the rich and the powerful.

When I tell you that reading  The Hard Sell  is like watching a Scorsese film, you will assume I am exaggerating. Pick it up and tell me I'm wrong.' - Patrick Radden Keefe,  The New York Times   In the early 2000s, John Kapoor had already amassed a small fortune in pharmaceuticals when he founded Insys Therapeutics. A boom time for painkillers, he had developed a novel formulation of fentanyl, the most potent opioid on the market. Kapoor, a brilliant scientist with relentless business instincts, was eager to make the most of his innovation. But there was a problem: the drug was a niche product, approved only for cancer patients in dire condition. So he recruited an avaricious team, who employed a variety of deceptive techniques, such as zeroing in on suspect doctors, falsifying patient records and deceiving insurance companies. Insys became a Wall Street sensation. That is, until insiders reached their breaking point and blew the whistle, sparking a sprawling investigation in the government's fight to hold the drug industry accountable in the spread of addictive opioids. With colourful characters and true suspense,  The Hard Sell  lays bare the pharma playbook. Evan Hughes offers a bracing look not just at Insys, but at how opioids are sold at the point they first enter the national bloodstream \u2013 in the doctor's office. "

                "A real-life murder mystery in turn-of-the-century London, and Scotland Yard's \"greatest detective of all time\" who was determined to discover whodunit.     By 1919, Det. Chief Inspector Fred Wensley was already a legend, having investigated the Jack the Ripper slayings, busted crime syndicates, and risked his life at the notorious Siege of Sidney Street. But the brutal murder of kindly fifty-four-year-old widow and shopkeeper Elizabeth Ridgley was an unexpected challenge in a storied career.    Elizabeth and her dog were both found dead in her blood-spattered shop in Hitchin. But even in the early days of forensics, Wensley was stunned by the inept conclusion of local Hertfordshire police: it was a freak, tragic accident that had somehow felled Elizabeth and her Irish terrier. At Wensley's urging, Scotland Yard proceeded with a second investigation. It led to the arrest of an Irish war veteran. The only real evidence: a blood-stained shirt. But the Ridgley case was far from over.    Drawing on primary sources and newly-discovered material, Paul Stickler exposes the frailties of county policing in the years after WWI, reveals how Ridgley's murder led to fundamental changes in methods of investigation, and attempts to solve a seemingly unsolvable crime.

Working for Ireland's criminal gangs they brought bloodshed and chaos to the streets. The Wilsons were not choosy about their targets.

It details the terrible cost in human suffering, particularly the death of an innocent teenage girl, Mariaora Rostas, when she randomly crossed their path.

Turns out that's only half the story.  David first met the Krays when he was seventeen years old. He was drawn into London's underworld, and became Ronnie's reluctant foot soldier, driver, errand boy. He was close to murder, and witnessed menaces and the increasingly psychotic behaviour of the most feared men in gangster land. Unbeknown to David, his brother Bobby had bravely turned informer at great risk to his own safety and that of his brothers. That had its own consequences. But why, when the police were being furnished with eye-witness statements, from an impeccable source, were they seemingly incapable of bringing the twins to justice? The Krays were untouchable. After tireless research through newly released documents in the National Archives, and piecing previously classified information together with his own, first-hand knowledge of the time, David Teale uncovers the shocking new truth, revealed in this book for the first time. David's story rewrites history. "

                "This true crime history examines the media frenzy surrounding Jack the Ripper\u2014and what the so-called Ripper Letters reveal about Victorian society.     In the autumn of 1888, a series of grisly murders took place in Whitechapel in London's East End. The Whitechapel murderer, arguably the first of his kind, was never caught, though the police and local press received hundreds of letters claiming to be from the killer. Though most if not all of these letters were hoaxes, they gave rise to the best known pen-name in criminal history: Jack the Ripper.    Some letters were taken more seriously than others, while a few\u2014such as the infamous \"Dear Boss\" letter\u2014sent thousands on a hunt to follow its clues. This book is not about the world's first serial killer but about the twisted souls who played the part on paper, implicated innocent men, or suggested ever more lurid ways in which he could be caught. For true crime historian M.J. Trow, these letters offer a window into the disturbing shadows of the Victorian mind. "

Their target: the charismatic, globe-trotting con man Phil Kitzer, who was responsible for swindling (and spending) millions of dollars and who some called the world's greatest. One problem, the FBI under J Edgar Hoover didn't really do undercover operations or fraud investigations.  So they did it anyway, making it up as they went along.  As the young agents became entangled in Kitzer's outrageous schemes, meeting other members of Kitzer's crime syndicate and powerful politicians and businessmen he fooled at each stop, they also grew to respect him - even care for him. And Kitzer began to think of Wedick and Brennan like sons, schooling them in everything from writing bad checks to picking up women.   Chasing Phil  by journalist and author David Howard is the story of an incredible round the world manhunt, a charismatic conman and a friendship that changed crime forever. "

She became the last woman to be hanged in Britain, and her execution is the most notorious of hangman Albert Pierrepoint's 'duties'.   Despite Ruth's infamy, the story of her life has never been fully told. Often wilfully misinterpreted, the reality behind the headlines was buried by an avalanche of hearsay. But now, through new interviews and comprehensive research into previously unpublished sources, Carol Ann Lee examines the facts without agenda or sensation. A portrait of the era and an evocation of 1950s club life in all its seedy glamour,  A Fine Day for a Hanging  sets Ruth's gripping story firmly in its historical context in order to tell the truth about both her timeless crime and a punishment that was very much of its time.

He was a legend - but also a fake master criminal without real power, his reputation manipulated and maintained by the government agents who had put him behind bars.     Drawing on secret government documents from archives in America and Europe, this myth-busting biography tells Luciano's real story, from his early days as a top hit man for the mob to his exploits running sex and narcotics empires and revelations about his trip to Nazi Germany to set up a drugs importing racket. His career abruptly halted by imprisonment, Luciano's reputation was enhanced by rumours that he was helping to win the Second World War for the Allies in Sicily and the Mediterranean. Through painstaking research, Newark exposes the truth about what Luciano really did during the war.    Expelled from the US in 1946, Luciano returned to Italy, where he was reputed to head a massive transatlantic narcotics network. In a complex conspiracy, he became a victim of the far greater powers around him, and Newark provides evidence that, at one time, he was even working as a Cold War agent, helping the US government fight Communism in Sicily. Lucky Luciano: Mafia Murderer and Secret Agent turns accepted Mafia history on its head with an extraordinary story that has never been told before. "

'A book that had to be written' Ray D'Arcy, RT\u00c9 Radio 1   For over a year, everyone assumed missing Dublin woman Elaine O'Hara had ended her own life. But after her remains were found, the police discovered that Elaine was in thrall to a man who had spent years grooming her to let him kill her. That man was Graham Dwyer, a married father of three and partner in a Dublin architecture practice.   Almost the Perfect Murder  details the exhaustive investigation - one of the most complex and chilling in Irish criminal justice history - that allowed garda\u00ed to build a case against Dwyer.

Hindley's later confession that she and Brady had lied in an attempt to reduce their sentences did little to diminish the slurs against his name.  For almost 45 years, Smith was asked by writers and film-makers to tell his story. Apart from a handful of brief interviews, he always refused. Carol Ann Lee met Smith during her research for  One of Your Own , her critically acclaimed biography of Hindley, following which he finally agreed to reveal all.  In  Witness , interviews, archival research and, most significantly, David Smith's own vivid memoir are fused to create an unforgettable, often harrowing account of his life before, during and after the Moors Murders.

Lee ChildIn a true crime cross between James Ellroy and David Simon's The Wire, A Good Month for Murder follows twelve homicides, three police-involved shootings and the furious hunt for an especially brutal killer in Washington D.C. After gaining unparalleled access to the homicide unit in Prince George's County, which borders the nation's capital, bestselling author Del Quentin Wilber begins shadowing the talented, often quirky detectives who get the call when a body falls. After a quiet couple of months, all hell breaks loose: suddenly every detective in the squad is scrambling to solve one shooting and stabbing after another. Meanwhile, the entire unit is obsessed with a stone-cold 'red ball', a high-profile case involving a seventeen-year-old honour student attacked by a gunman who kicked down the door to her house and shot her in her bed. This is the inside story of how a team of detectives carry out their almost impossible job.Murder is the police investigator's ultimate crucible: to solve a killing, a detective must speak for the dead. A Good Month for Murder is a compelling true crime account which shows what it takes to succeed when the stakes couldn't possibly be higher. "

The dirty bankers and businessmen he befriended knew him as Bob Musella, a wealthy, mob-connected big shot living the good life. Together they partied in expensive hotels, drank the world's finest champagnes, drove Rolls-Royce convertibles and flew in private jets. But under Mazur's designer suits and hidden away in his quality briefcase, recorders whirred quietly, capturing the damning evidence of their crimes. Then, at his own staged wedding, he led a dramatic takedown that shook the underworld. In the end, more than eighty men and women were charged worldwide. Operation C-Chase became one of the most successful undercover operations in the history of US law enforcement, and evidence gathered during the bust proved critical to the conviction of General Manuel Noriega.The Infiltrator is the true story of how Mazur's undercover work helped bring down the unscrupulous bankers who manipulated complex international finance systems to serve drug lords - including Pablo Escobar and the infamous Medillin cartel - corrupt politicians, tax cheats and terrorists. It is a shocking chronicle of the rise and fall of perhaps the biggest and most intricate money-laundering operation of all time. And, at its heart, it's a vivid portrait of an undercover life and the sacrifices it requires.Filled with dangerous lies, near misses and harrowing escapes,  The Infiltrator is as bracing and explosive as the greatest fiction thrillers - only it's all true.

                "\"A thrilling ticktock on the borderland slayings and the effort to solve them.\"\u2014Texas Monthly     The shocking true-crime story of a U.S. Border Patrol agent turned serial killer, the four sex workers whom he mercilessly killed, and the upended border town of Laredo where his heinous crimes occurred.   Twelve days is all it took.  Melissa Ramirez, Claudine Anne Luera, Guiselda Hernandez, and Janelle Ortiz were four marginalized women striving to make ends meet as sex workers. They looked out for one another. But they would soon share a connection that none of them could have imagined. When Melissa was found dead, the other three women were on edge but assumed they were safe. Twelve days later, they too were dead and police had detained an unlikely suspect\u2014Juan David Ortiz, a ten-year veteran of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, where he carried a badge, a service revolver, and was entrusted to protect the community in which he eventually killed. From September 3 through September 15, 2018, Ortiz, a husband and doting father to three children, lured his victims into his white Dodge truck and drove them to the outskirts of town where he violently executed them, leaving them dead or dying on the sides of dark, rural roads.  In this fast-paced, electrifying tick-tock, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning USA TODAY journalist Rick Jervis tells the gripping story of the four murders that shook the small border town of Laredo, and the quest to unmask a cold, calculated killer who was hiding in plain sight. The Devil Behind the Badge is also a deeply human portrait of the four lives lost and an attempt to uncover what motivated Ortiz's descent into darkness. Along the way, it raises serious questions about the border crisis, the abuse of law enforcement, and the challenges of a federal agency to police its own ranks. "

Fans of true crime accounts or contemporary history will savor this.\"  \u2015 Publishers Weekly          President Gerald Ford suffered two attempts on his life during his term in office: one by a young woman in Charles Manson's Family, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, and the other by a far more unlikely candidate\u2014an average middle-aged mother of five\u2014Sara Jane Moore. After thirty years in contact with Moore in prison, journalist Geri Spieler deconstructs her life in  Housewife Assassin , tracing the path from Moore's small-town upbringing in West Virginia to that fateful moment when she tried to assassinate the president.        Throughout Moore's dodgy life she hid her identity and misled those around her. Through the turbulent 60s and 70s, she married five times, abandoned children, faked amnesia, befriended Patty Hearst's father, became a revolutionary, and worked as an FBI informant turned double agent feeding information to the underground radicals, all before the assassination attempt.      From Spieler's insider correspondence and independent research, including interviews with President Ford himself, she confirms details (the gunshot missed the President's head by six inches) and debunks others (Sara Jane did not \"shoot wild\" as the press had reported) to deliver a compelling profile of a society lady turned elusive assassin.

On September 13, 2016, in the small town of Ashland, Ohio, emergency dispatchers received a 911 call from a terrified woman who claimed to be kidnapped. The man holding her hostage was Shawn Grate, a serial killer whom the press later dubbed \"The Ladykiller.\" A key to his conviction and death sentence were Grate's extensive recorded confessions\u2014all extracted by one woman: Detective Kim Mager.  As an experienced specialist in sex offenses, Detective Mager was one of the officers assigned to Grate's case upon his arrest. Grate immediately latched onto her, repeatedly demanding to speak to her and presumably convinced that he could somehow exercise his power over her in much the same way that he'd overpowered and controlled his female victims.  He was wrong.  Over a period of eight days, Mager conducted one interview after another, risking her life by sitting alone in the interview room with a malevolent predator. Using brilliant psychological strategy in a lethal game of wits, Mager successfully elicited his damning confessions to five murders, kidnapping, and multiple sexual assaults of women across Ohio.  Deeply personal and shocking,  A Hunger to Kill  takes readers behind the scenes of one of the most appalling criminal cases in American history from the woman who stopped his murderous rampage in collaboration with  New York Times  bestselling author Lisa Pulitzer.

                "The bestselling author of  Norco \u201980  returns with a riveting story of mid-1980s San Diego that placed one young Black man at the center of a whirlwind of crime and punishment that profoundly altered Southern California  March 31, 1985. Two white patrol officers in search of a gang member followed a pickup truck carrying seven young Black men up a dirt driveway in the Encanto neighborhood of Southeastern San Diego. Minutes later, gunshots rang out, and the truck\u2019s driver, Sagon Penn, fled the scene in an officer\u2019s patrol car. The incident stunned the city. What followed would change it forever. Penn was an idealist who believed in the power of Buddhist chants to bring about the oneness of humanity. The two police officers were rising stars in one of the most progressive police departments in the country, yet one that had suffered more officers killed in the line of duty than any other. While the facts of the case were never in dispute, what remained unresolved was what, if anything, could justify such a violent confrontation? For over two years, a determined prosecutor and a charismatic defense attorney engaged in a sensational courtroom drama that revolved around matters of mental health, racial biases, and the self-image of a once-sleepy beach town grappling with its transformation into a major metropolitan area. The Sagon Penn incident forever altered how San Diego would respond to incidents involving police and communities of color. Based on court transcripts, personal interviews, and archival police reports,  Reap the Whirlwind  is a gripping true-crime narrative set against the evocative backdrop of Southern California. "

Edna's world turned upside down when her close cousin, Ted Bundy, was linked to the gruesome murders that had plagued her hometown of Seattle. Both devastating and dangerous, she reveals her journey of discovering the truth about her cousin who was more like a sibling, a man she loved, admired, and thought she knew so well. Edna delves into the unbelievable and chilling episodes she experienced, from confronting Ted and discovering a side of him she never suspected to waking to the FBI at her door after he escaped jail.   Whether searching memories for signs she'd missed or detailing scenes of life under the radar in a world still fixated on her cousin, Edna's account tells the Ted Bundy story from a critical, new perspective: someone who called him family.

                "Was Nandlal Kapur a traitor or a patriot?    A true story, like no other.   1920s India. Flames of revolt against colonial rule had engulfed the country, making the British tense.   They knew domestic spies were essential to track and quell the calls for independence. Nandlal Kapur, like many young Indian men, was recruited as a spy. But, while the pay was good and the life adventurous, Nandlal restless and uneasy, his love for his country at constant odds with his new reality.   As he travelled through India on various missions, and met revolutionaries from all walks of life demanding freedom from oppression, he grew determined to attack the beast from within its and do his bit for his country - become a double agent.   The Silk Route Spy is a riveting account of an extraordinary life, and brings to life a trying era in our country's history and gives us a glimpse of the risks taken and sacrifices made by those who freed India, in their own small ways.

                "Soon to be a MAJOR MOVIE. A gripping and heartbreaking story, A Thousand Miles from Care tells the 30-year quest Steve Johnson undertook to uncover the truth about his brilliant brother's death. At the entrance of Sydney Harbor, the cliffs rise fourteen stories above the Pacific, like a gigantic skirt made of sandstone. North Head, one of the most memorable cliffs, is a gorgeous place to watch the sunrise. But it's an unforgiving place to lose your footing. When Steve Johnson's younger brother Scott went over the edge in 1988, he hit an outcrop on the way down and exploded on the rocks below. A Thousand Miles from Care draws upon the mountain of exclusive materials Steve amassed over his 32-year fight for answers, including sealed court transcripts, police records, interviews with suspects, inquest reports, correspondence with gang members, private investigations, and much else. It utilizes unique details, interview transcripts and insights based on Johnson's close relationship with authorities and high-ranking New South Wales officials developed over more than three decades. This profoundly impactful book traces the steps Steve Johnson, his family and friends took to solve the mystery of Scott's alleged suicide, navigating an openly hostile police force and a maze of dead ends, unreliable informants, skinhead gangs, a faked confession, police-connected drug rings, and setbacks at every turn. A Thousand Miles from Care is above all, a love story between two brothers but shared by everyone who worked so long for truth and justice for Scott. "

And so, incredibly, Giovanni rises from the dead, determined to both seek redemption for his unforgivable crime and take down the gang who drove him to do it.

                "After graduating from Mississippi State University in 1976, Di Rushing and her husband, Sam, found themselves back on their family farm near Merigold, Mississippi, with 350 acres and no real clue what to do. The couple decided to open the first winery in Mississippi, and with it, a successful business was born. Six years later, a small restaurant joined the Delta winery. Both businesses were thriving by 1990, with eight national award-winning wines, a beautiful vineyard, and a successful restaurant. But in March of 1990, a series of unforeseen events rocked the operation. After the Rushings discovered one of the tour guides, Ray Russell, selling drugs in the winery parking lot, they fired him. He responded with a terrorizing vengeance that persisted over the next nine months. In the early morning hours, the former guide broke into the winery, crept into the wine cellar, and released the entire inventory\u2014nearly a quarter of a million dollars' worth\u2014down the drain. Fortunately, his incompetence thwarted his most destructive intention to blow up the restaurant. In his rampage, he broke all the windows, which allowed the gas from the kitchen oven to escape, sparing the premises. Though the Rushings rebuilt with the help of their community, Russell continued to stalk and threaten the young family. As his menacing behavior continued to escalate, the Rushings closed their business of fourteen years and moved to Ouray, Colorado, where they began rebuilding their lives. Culminating in the sudden, violent murders of Russell, his wife, and his father twenty-five years later, this book tells a story of both shock and resilience, charting Mississippi history in the process. Intertwined with the true crime narrative,  The Delta in the Rearview Mirror: The Life and Death of Mississippi's First Winery  details author Di Rushing's life in and out of Mississippi, including growing up in 1960s Greenville, attending university, traveling overseas, and the relationships she cultivated along the way.

When you work hard, you play hard, and Pittsburgh is a hardworking city. So, when Prohibition hit the Steel City, it created a level of violence and corruption residents had never witnessed. Illegal producers ran stills in kitchens, basements, bathroom tubs, warehouses and even abandoned distilleries. War between gangs of bootleggers resulted in a number of murders and bombings that placed Pittsburgh on the same level as New York City and Chicago in criminal activity. John Bazzano ordered the killing of the Volpe brothers but did so without the permission of Mafia bosses; his battered body was later found on the street in Brooklyn. Author Richard Gazarik details the shady side of the Steel City during a tumultuous era. "

                "On December 17, 1927 in Los Angeles, twelve year old Marion Parker, daughter of a prominent banker, was called to the school office where a stranger told her that her father had been in an accident and that she must leave with him right away. Fewer than 48 hours later, she was dead.  What started as a tragic, but otherwise ordinary, kidnapping turned out to be a shocking murder by one of the period's most twisted killers, William Edward Hickman. James L. Neibaur takes a step into history, depicting how this abduction was soon labeled the \"crime of the century\" and sparked a change in the nation's attention to such cases. With a media-driven nationwide manhunt, one of the biggest and most wide-ranging in California history, and then a desperate attempt at sparing the killer's life with the unfamiliar insanity plea, this infamous case left the abduction and murder of Marion Parker to be etched into 1920s pop culture.  The murder of Marion Parker brought to light the unthinkable reality of child abduction. Neibaur resourcefully weaves together the events surrounding the crime in the context of the contemporary culture and attitudes of the late 1920s, covering the impact of the media's first involvement in a criminal justice case, and how the admired notions of the glamorized '20s were crushed by this ordinary family's chilling reality.

                "She's Gone  collects the true stories of five different women living in different decades who all have one thing in common: one moment they were busy living their lives and the next moment ... they were gone.   From the 1910 disappearance of New York heiress Dorothy Arnold to the 1977 vanishing of teenager Simone Ridinger, author Brunelle details both famous and lesser-known cases that remain unsolved. Board a luxury liner with Agnes Tufverson as she embarks on a European honeymoon before her mysterious 1933 disappearance over the Atlantic; follow Jean Spangler to a famous 1940s Hollywood nightclub as she arrives for a clandestine meeting in a private booth.   Due to a strong belief that good girls didn't disappear, when authorities and family members were presented with missing women in the twentieth century, it was often assumed that they had simply ran away. Most investigations were funded by family members, and when women were found to be the victims of violent crime, they were faulted for placing themselves in dangerous situations. On the rare occasions when authorities investigated cases, they relied on interviews and cash trails in combination with rudimentary forensics such as blood typing and fingerprinting to find missing persons. For those reasons, many of the real stories from this time period have yet to be told.  Featuring never-before-seen letters and documents, personal interviews, and genealogical research alongside captivating storytelling, Brunelle delves deep into the lives of those who disappeared and the circumstances surrounding their disappearances.   , "

When Marion Barter disappeared in 1997, police initially dismissed it as the actions of a divorced mother abandoning her family. In this book, the creators of the addictive global hit podcast The Lady Vanishes detail the winding investigation into Marion's disappearance, from tentative early police efforts to her daughter's 27-year search for answers.  The Lady Vanishes is an engrossing story of how a small team of seasoned investigative journalists and storytellers, a daughter's intuition and a team of listener super-sleuths uncovered a web of intrigue spanning nine decades and three continents, and how - after 57 episodes, 20 million downloads and sparking a coronial inquiry - they discovered at the heart of the mystery a stranger-than-fiction international man of mystery who could hold the key to what really happened to Marion.

                "A true crime account of a mass shooting by gangster brothers which resulted in the deaths of six police officers in Depression-era Missouri.   \u00a0  \u201cIn all the annals of preservation of the peace there is no story that runs more gallantly than this.\u201d \u2014 Springfield Leader , January 4, 1932  As dusk fell on a bitterly cold night during the Great Depression, a posse of ten local lawmen approached two brothers holed up in an isolated Missouri farmhouse. Minutes later, six officers were dead, three were wounded, and the outlaws had escaped. After a wild car chase through Oklahoma and across Texas, police finally surrounded Harry and Jennings Young in their Houston hideout.  The brutal killings attracted the national press (at first Pretty Boy Floyd was rumored to be involved) and the \u201ccarnival of carnage\u201d that became known as the Young Brothers Massacre represented the highest number of law enforcement officers killed on a single day until September 11, 2001. Even in the hardscrabble Ozarks, a region historically known for frontier justice and vigilante activity, these crimes caused a sensation, and the Young brothers briefly joined the ranks of infamy with Bonnie and Clyde and other famous outlaws.  Author Bruce Davis, a third-generation Methodist minister from Springfield, Missouri, became fascinated with this forgotten case after noticing a memorial to the six fallen police officers in his local police station. He has devoted this account, his first book, to telling the whole story and honoring the brave lawmen who died in their attempts to exact justice. "

In 2004, the FBI was tipped off to a gruesome pattern of unsolved murders along American roadways. Today at least 850 homicides have been linked to a solitary breed of predators: long-haul truck drivers. They have been given names like the \"Truck Stop Killer,\" who rigged a traveling torture chamber in the rear of his truck and is suspected to have killed fifty women, and \"The Interstate Strangler,\" who once answered a phone call from his mother while killing one of his dozen victims. The crisis was such that the FBI opened a special unit, the Highway Serial Killings Initiative. In many cases, the victims\u2014often at-risk women\u2014are picked up at truck stops in one jurisdiction, sexually assaulted and murdered in another, and dumped along a highway in a third place. The transient nature of the offenders and multiple jurisdictions involved make these cases incredibly difficult to solve.  Based on his own on-the-ground research and drawing on his twenty-five-year career as an FBI special agent, Frank Figliuzzi investigates the most terrifying cases. He also rides in a big-rig with a long-haul trucker for thousands of miles, gaining an intimate understanding of the life and habits of drivers and their roadside culture. And he interviews the courageous trafficked victims of these crimes, and their inspiring efforts to now help others avoid similar fates.  Long Haul is a gripping exploration of a violent, disordered world hiding in plain sight, and the heroes racing to end the horror. It will forever unsettle how you travel on the road. "

                "On 24 May 1971, based on a telephone call purportedly from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her secretary P.N. Haksar, the chief cashier at the Parliament Street branch of the State Bank of India handed over Rs 60 lakh to a stranger posing as the PM's courier. The money was supposedly meant for secret operations in East Pakistan. When the chief cashier approached the PMO for a receipt, he was told that neither Haksar nor the PM had given any such instructions. He had been duped.  Within a few hours, the Delhi Police recovered the cash and caught the man responsible for the heist, a former army captain-Rustom Sohrab Nagarwala. Subsequent events-which included a botched police investigation, bungling by the lower judiciary, mysterious deaths of the accused and the principal investigator, and Indira Gandhi's inexplicable silence-led to the rise of several conspiracy theories.   Based on police records, press reports, depositions before the Justice Jaganmohan Reddy Commission and its report, The Scam That Shook a Nation is the first authoritative work on the scam, its investigation and its afterlife as a study in political corruption.

She was right there... until she was gone.   College student Lauren Spierer was pursuing her dreams, joining her boyfriend at a party school eight hundred miles from home. Social and gregarious, studying fashion and rooming with friends, Lauren embraced her new adventure with the zeal of a young woman who suddenly had everything she desired.  But there was a dark side that she and her inner circle kept secret. And one warm June evening, after heading out with friends, she seemingly vanished.

With original reporting including new testimony witnesses never shared with police, College Girl, Missing takes readers back to that fateful night and dives into the disappearance that captured front-page headlines around the world. Investigative journalist Shawn Cohen breaks more than a decade of silence as he pursues the truth: what really happened to Lauren Spierer?. "

                "'A shocking story of serial killers, twisted idealism and a country that looked away' Rory Carroll, bestselling author of Killing Thatcher \ufeffIn a tour de force of investigative journalism, White Terror tells for the first time the story of the National Socialist Underground in Germany \u2013 in an engrossing global story that examines violence, modern racism and national trauma. Not long after the Berlin Wall fell, three teenagers became friends in the East German town of Jena. It was a time of excitement, but also of deep uncertainty: some four million East Germans found themselves out of a job. At first the three friends spent their nights wandering the streets, smoking, drinking, looking for trouble. Then they began attending far-right rallies with people who called themselves National Socialists: Nazis. Like the Hitler-led Nazis before them, they blamed minorities for their ills. Believing foreigners were a threat to their homeland, the three friends embarked on the most horrific string of white nationalist killings since the Holocaust. Their target: immigrants. In a tour de force of investigative journalism and novelistic storytelling, White Terror follows the National Socialist Underground, or NSU, from their radicalisation as young skinheads through their transformation into fully fledged terrorists carrying out bombings and assassinations while living on the run. But it's also about something almost as terrifying: the German police and intelligence services that missed clues, mishandled far-right informants and repeatedly tried to paint the immigrant victims as mafiosos. Once the terror plot was revealed, the authorities shredded documents to cover up their mistakes and refused to acknowledge that their racism had led them astray. A masterwork of reporting, White Terror reveals how a group of young Germans carried out a shocking spree of white supremacist violence, and how a nation and its government ignored them until it was too late.

Mob-style executions, drug smuggling, and vicious gang warfare are seldom part of the postcard image. Yet, Hawaii was once home to not only Aloha spirit, but also a ruthless, homegrown mafia underworld. From 1960 to 1980, Hawaiian gangsters grew rich off a robust trade in drugs, gambling, and prostitution that followed in the wake of Hawaii's tourist boom.  Thus, by 1980\u2014the year Charles Marsland was elected Honolulu's top prosecutor\u2014the honeymoon island paradise was also plagued by violence, corruption and organized crime. The zeal that Marsland brought to his crusade against the Hawaiian underworld was relentless, self-destructive, and very personal. Five years earlier, Marsland's son had been gunned down. His efforts to bring his son's killers to justice\u2014and indeed, eradicate the entire organized criminal element in Hawaii\u2014make for an extraordinary tale that culminates with intense courtroom drama.  Hawaii Five-O  meets  Wiseguy  in author Jason Ryan's vigorously reported chronicle of brazen gangsters, brutal murders, and a father's quest for vengeance\u2014all set against an unlikely backdrop of seductive tropical beauty.

Gangs of horse thieves sprang out of camps from the Musselshell in Montana, along the Missouri into Dakota Territory, up into Mouse River-Dogden Butte country and ending at Turtle Mountain. Cattlemen and homesteaders formed vigilance committees, including Granville Stuart's Montana Stranglers, resulting in the violent death of fifty-four people from September 1883 to December 1884. They weren't all guilty and there were probably more. Author Ron Berget shares this thoroughly researched, true story of the Montana Stranglers' bloody pursuits throughout the northern plains. "

Regina Mart\u00ednez was no stranger to retaliation. A journalist out of Mexico's Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, Regina's stories for the magazine  Proceso  laid out the corruption and abuse underlying Mexican politics. She was barred from press conferences, and copies of  Proceso  often disappeared before they made the newsstands. In 2012, shortly after  Proceso  published an article on corruption and two Veracruz politicians, and the magazine went missing once again, she was bludgeoned to death in her bathroom. The message was clear: No journalist in Mexico was safe.    Katherine Corcoran, then leading the Associated Press coverage of Mexico, admired Regina Mart\u00ednez's work. Troubled by the news of her death, Corcoran journeyed to Veracruz to find out what had happened. Regina hadn't even written the controversial article. But did she have something else that someone didn't want published? Once there, Katherine bonded with four of Regina's grief-stricken mentees, each desperate to prove who was to blame for the death of their friend. Together they battled cover-ups, narco-officials, red tape, and threats to sift through the mess of lies-and discover what got Regina killed.    A gripping look at reporters who dare to step on the deadly \"third rail,\" where the state and organized crime have become indistinguishable,  In the Mouth of the Wolf  confronts how silencing the free press threatens basic protections and rule of law across the globe.

                "The shocking series of crimes committed by lovers Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez dominated the front pages in 1949. Caught for the double homicide of a widow and her young daughter in Michigan, the first couple of crime became the focus of an intense debate over the death penalty and extradition. Their story climaxed in a sensational trial in New York City and concluded two years later inside Sing Sing's notorious \"Death House.\" Pulp fiction era reporters, who followed every step taken by the accused slayers, christened Beck and Fernandez the \"Lonely Hearts Killers\"\u2014a nickname that stuck and has since been used to describe an entire category of criminal behavior. Despite the sensationalization of the killer couple's exploits, the story of the Michigan crime that ended their spree has until now remained largely untold. Drawing on rare archival material, this book presents, for the first time anywhere, a detailed account of this lost chapter in the saga of the \"Lonely Hearts Killers.\" Both biography and analysis, this book also attempts to deconstruct the myths and misconceptions and to provide answers to a few unanswered questions about the case.

                "The thrilling story of a brazen, uncatchable jewel thief who roamed the homes of Dallas high society\u2014and a window into the dark secrets lurking beneath the surface of the Swinging Sixties.   As a string of high profile jewel thefts went unsolved, \"the King of Diamonds,\" as he was dubbed by the press, eluded police and the FBI for more than a decade and took advantage of the parties and devil-may-care attitude of the Swinging Sixties.    Like Cary Grant in \"To Catch a Thief,\" the King was so bold that he tip-toed into the homes of millionaires while they were watching television, or hosting parties. He hid in their closets. And dared to smoke a cigarette while they were sleeping not far away. Rena Pederson, then a young cub reporter at the  Dallas Morning News,  heard the police reports trickle in while she managed the night desk.   With gymnastic skill, this thief climbed trees or crawled across rooftops to get into these sprawling mansions. He took jewels from heiresses, oil kings, corporate CEOs. These were not just some of the richest people in Texas; they were some of the richest people of their time. Scotland Yard and Interpol were on the look-out. But the thief was never caught and the jewels never recovered.    To follow the tracks of the thief, Rena has interviewed more than two hundred people, from veteran cops to strippers. She went to pawn shops, Las Vegas casinos, and a Mafia hangout\u2014and discovered that beneath the glittering fa\u00e7ade of Dallas debutantes and raucaous parties was a world of sex trafficking, illegal gambling, and political graft. When one of the leading suspects was found dead in highly unusual circumstances, the story darkened. What seemed to be taken from the pages of an Edna Ferber story now crashed head-first into Mickey Spillane.    Like the stories of Fantomas or Raffles, the odd psychological aspects of the  The King of Diamonds  give us different kind of crime story. Detectives were stumped: Why did the thief break into houses when his targets were inside, increasing the risk of being captured? Why did he hide in their closets? Many times, he was so close he could hear their breathing as they slept. As one socialite put it, \"It was a very peculiar business.\" "

In 1979, a daring new plan was introduced, unlike anything previously attempted by a UK police force. A small group of young female officers \u2013 some aged just 18 \u2013 put their lives on the line, walking the quiet residential roads late at night, acting as bait.

                "The stranger-than-fiction story of the now-notorious Lowcountry clan, in all its Southern Gothic intensity\u2014by an author with unparalleled access to and knowledge of the players, the history, and the place.   The most famous man in South Carolina lives in prison. He stands convicted of a staggering amount of wrongdoing\u2014more than 100 crimes and counting. Once a high-flying, smooth-talking, pedigreed Southern lawyer, Alex Murdaugh is now disbarred and disgraced. For more than a decade, prosecutors asserted that Alex was secretly a fraud, a thief, a drug trafficker, and an all-around phony. On the night of June 7, 2021, they claimed, he also became a killer, shooting dead his wife and son in a desperate bid to escape accountability. The many crimes of Alex Murdaugh, exposed piecemeal over the last two years, have appalled the general public. Yet his implosion\u2014the spectacular manner in which he has turned his vaunted family name to mud\u2014has also proved mesmerizing. With every revelation, Alex Murdaugh has been shown to be a man without bottom, though he insists he never harmed his family. Remarkably, all of his misdeeds have precedent. In  Swamp Kings,  Jason Ryan reveals Alex's evil actions are only the tip of the iceberg. When it comes to the Murdaugh family of Hampton County, history has a way of repeating itself. For every alleged, headline-grabbing crime associated with Alex Murdaugh, mirror-image incidents have played out within his family's past, including parallel instances of fraud, theft, illicit trafficking of babies and booze, calamitous boat crashes, and even alleged murder. There were some crimes committed by Alex's kin that even he would not dare mimic. Covering a century of depravity in an impoverished and isolated stretch of the Deep South,  Swamp Kings  weaves together the jaw-dropping narratives of generations of Murdaughs before culminating in the telling of a murder trial for the ages. Page after page the family's legacy is laid bare as a spotlight is finally trained on the Murdaugh men who have long lorded over the South Carolina Lowcountry. "

                "The behind-the-scenes story of the quintessential film noir and cult classic, Billy Wilder\u2019s  Double Indemnity \u2014its true crime origins and crucial impact on film history\u2014is told for the first time in this riveting narrative published for the film's 80th anniversary.   From actual murder to magazine fiction to movie, the history of  Double Indemnity  is as complex as anything that hit the screen during film noir\u2019s classic period. A 1927 tabloid sensation \u201ccrime of the century\u201d inspired journalist and would-be crime-fiction writer James M. Cain to pen a novella. Hollywood quickly bid on the film rights, but throughout the 1930s a strict code of censorship made certain that no studio could green-light a murder melodrama based on real events. Then in 1943 veteran scriptwriter and newly minted director Billy Wilder wanted the story for his third movie. With tentative approval from the studio he hired hardboiled novelist Raymond Chandler to co-write a script that would be acceptable to industry censors.  Director Wilder then cajoled a star cast into coming aboard: the incomparable Barbara Stanwyck in her unforgettable turn as the ultimate femme fatale; alongside Fred MacMurray, going against type as her accomplice; and Edward G. Robinson as a dogged claims investigator. Wilder kept Chandler on for the entire shoot, and other key collaborators were cinematographer John Seitz, costume designer Edith Head,\u00a0 and composer Mikl\u00f4s R\u00f4zsa. With all these talented contributors, the final film became one of the earliest studio noirs to gain critical and commercial success, including being nominated for seven Oscars. It powerfully influenced the burgeoning noir movement, spawned many imitators, and affected the later careers of all its cast and crew.  Double Indemnity \u2019s impact on filmmakers and audiences is still felt eight decades since its release.  Authors Alain Silver and James Ursini tell the complete, never-before-told history of writing, making, and marketing of\u00a0 Double Indemnity  in their latest and most provocative work on film noir:  From the Moment They Met It Was Murder .

Avery was now the most wanted criminal on earth. To the authorities, Avery was the enemy of all mankind. To the people he was a hero. Rumors swirled about his disappearance. The only certainty is that Henry Avery became a ghost.    What happened to the notorious Avery has been pirate history's most baffling cold case for centuries. Now, in a remote archive, a coded letter written by \"Avery the Pirate\" himself, years after he disappeared, reveals a stunning truth. He was a pirate that came in from the cold . . .    In  The   Pirate King,  Sean Kingsley and Rex Cowan brilliantly tie Avery to the shadowy lives of two other icons of the early 18th century, including Daniel Defoe, the world-famous novelist and\u2014as few people know\u2014a deep-cover spy with more than a hundred pseudonyms, and Archbishop Thomas Tenison, a Protestant with a hatred of Catholic France.    Sean Kingsley and Rex Cowan's  The Pirate King  brilliantly reveals the untold epic story of Henry Avery in all it's colorful glory\u2014his exploits, his survival, his secret double life, and how he inspired the golden age of piracy.

                "A wry, instructive, and hugely entertaining account of \"one of the most sensational trials in American history\" ( New York Times Book Review ).  On the night of July 3, 1870, Elizabeth Tilton confessed to her husband that she'd had an affair with their pastor, Henry Ward Beecher. This secret would soon transfix America, for Beecher was the most famous preacher of the day, founder of the most fashionable church in Brooklyn Heights, a presidential hopeful, an influential supporter of Abolition, and a leader of the campaign for women's suffrage. When Beecher tried to silence the Tiltons, it was a whisper network of suffragists, notably Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who spread news of the affair, and it was the radical Victoria Woodhull\u2014an outspoken proponent of \"free love\"\u2014who seized on it, as political dynamite, to blow up the myth of monogamy among the political elite. Her public accusations led to even more public trials, which shocked the country and divided the most progressive thinkers of the era.    In 1953, the journalist Robert Shaplen revisited the Tilton-Beecher affair in a series of articles for the  New Yorker , relying on 3,000 pages of contemporary accounts\u2014court transcripts, love-letters, newspaper reports and illustrations, even political cartoons\u2014to reanimate a scandal that shook the American reform movement and to expose a strand of America's cultural DNA that remains recognizable today.

Volkman was the central figure in a massive \u201cpill mill\u201d scheme in southern Ohio. His pain clinics accepted only cash, employed armed guards, and dispensed a torrent of opioid painkillers and other controlled substances. For nearly three years, Volkman remained in business despite raids by law enforcement and complaints from patients\u2019 family members. Prosecutors would ultimately link him to the overdose deaths of 13 patients, though investigators explored his ties to at least 20 other deaths. This groundbreaking book is based on 12 years of correspondence and interviews with Volkman. Eil also traveled to 19 states, interviewed more than 150 people, and filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Drug Enforcement Administration that led to the release of nearly 20,000 pages of trial evidence. The American opioid epidemic is, like this book, a true crime story. Through this one doctor\u2019s story, an era of unfathomable tragedy is brought down to a tangible, and devastating, human scale.

Known to the world as Lord George Sanger, he was once the biggest name in show business, and was venerated as a national institution. The death of Britain's wealthiest showman read like a popular crime thriller: a merciless killer; a famous victim; sensational media headlines; a desperate manhunt laced with police incompetencies and a dramatic denouement few could have anticipated. But for over a century, questions have persisted about the murder. Weaving in the story of George's rise to fame and the history of Britain's entertainment industry, The Killing of Lord George uses previously unpublished archive material to reconstruct the events leading up to the death and reveal the true story behind the brutal crime that shocked Edwardian England.

She had been brutally murdered. The body was identified as Karissa Boudreau, who had been missing for two weeks and was the subject of an intense missing person investigation by the Bridgewater Police Service. Her murder rocked the community, the province and the nation.    The RCMP began a homicide investigation, as Karissa's body was found in their jurisdiction. Over the following five months, the RCMP carried out an extensive and costly investigation, which included the \"Mr. Big\" operation. As liaison between the RCMP investigative team and the undercover team, Sgt. John Elliott worked closely and travelled with the undercover team during their four-month operation. Supported by police file notes and court documents, his riveting first-hand account of this carefully constructed procedure meticulously takes the reader through the missing person investigation, the homicide investigation, and the undercover operation.   On June 13, 2008, the RCMP made an arrest and the following day they charged Penny Boudreau with the first-degree murder of her daughter Karissa. Why did she do it? Penny's obsessive love for her boyfriend Vernon and her fear of losing him drove her to plan the cold-blooded murder of her only child. This is the shocking story of a child who simply became an inconvenience.   Elliott's gripping description of Penny's heartless murder confession to \"Mr. Big\" reveals how ruthless she was and how she was brought to justice. It was an exceptionally disturbing murder, unprecedented in Nova Scotia and uncommon throughout the world. Karissa was betrayed and murdered by her mother, whom she loved dearly and who was supposed to protect her and love her unconditionally.    Many of the police investigators, including Sgt. Elliott, were profoundly affected by what they saw and heard during the investigation. And the devastating ripple effect of Penny's heinous crime spread from Karissa's family and friends to the community and beyond. A shocking but compelling story, A Mother's Betrayal takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. "

Dubbed Angel, her remains lay unidentified for years. Who was she, how did she die, and at whose hand?  Then, in July 2015, the bones of a child were found in a suitcase by a highway in South Australia. Months later, a call to Crime Stoppers led to an identification. Two-year-old Khandalyce Pearce had left Alice Springs in 2008 with her mother and hadn't been seen since. Through DNA, Angel was quickly identified as Khandalyce's mother, Karlie Pearce-Stevenson.

                "'A compelling yet harrowing read'  Daily Mail  'One of the best true crime books of the year'  CrimeReads   The 2014 Slenderman stabbings in Wisconsin, USA, shocked the local community and the world. The violence of Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weiser, the two twelve-year-old girls who attempted to stab their classmate to death, was extreme, but what seemed even more frightening was that they had done so under the influence of an internet meme, the so-called 'Slenderman'.  Slenderman  tells the full story for the very first time. Morgan and Anissa's friendship could so easily not have taken the turn it did - but Morgan was suffering with early onset schizophrenia. She believed she had been seeing Slenderman for years, and that the only way to stop him killing her family was to bring him a sacrifice. Her victim miraculously survived the attack but was left deeply traumatised, while the severity of their crime meant Morgan and Anissa would be tried as adults.  Slenderman  is both a page-turning true crime classic and a compelling search for justice. "
