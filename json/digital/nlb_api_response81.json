The 21st century, which is characterized by the emergence of knowledge-based societies, expects learners to be comfortable in dealing with ambiguities and complexities in the real world and to be able to use knowledge as a tool at their workplace. This book will help readers develop an in-depth understanding of authentic problem solving and learning, and how it can be used to make a difference in their school or learning communities for the development of 21st century competencies. Comprising 20 chapters written by Singapore-based and international authors, the book is organized into three themes: authentic problems, authentic practices, and authentic participation. It details innovative school practices (e.g. productive failure) concerning the design of problems, learning activities, learning environments, and ICT tools for authentic problem solving and learning. Along with theoretical explanations of authentic learning processes and outcomes, the book also elucidates how students learn by generating and exploring solutions to complex problems and which cognitive functions are needed at different stages of problem-based learning. Presenting coherent descriptions of instructional design principles, successful cases and challenges encountered in K-12 schools and learning communities, the book provides useful information, new insights, and practical guidance for school directors, parents, teachers and researchers seeking to develop authentic learning environments for 21st century learners.

Incorporating input from dozens of biomedical researchers who described what they perceived as key open problems of imaging that are amenable to attack by mathematical scientists and physicists, this book introduces the frontiers of biomedical imaging, especially the imaging of dynamic physiological functions, to the educated nonspecialist. Ten imaging modalities are covered, from the well-established (e.g., CAT scanning, MRI) to the more speculative (e.g., electrical and magnetic source imaging). For each modality, mathematics and physics research challenges are identified and a short list of suggested reading offered. Two additional chapters offer visions of the next generation of surgical and interventional techniques and of image processing. A final chapter provides an overview of mathematical issues that cut across the various modalities. "

The author assumes no prior knowledge of probability and presents all the necessary preliminary material simply and clearly in chapters on probability, normal random variables, and the geometric Brownian motion model that underlies the Black-Scholes theory. He carefully explains the concept of arbitrage with many examples; he then presents the arbitrage theorem and uses it, along with a multiperiod binomial approximation of geometric Brownian motion, to obtain a simple derivation of the Black-Scholes call option formula. Simplified derivations are given for the delta hedging strategy, the partial derivatives of the Black-Scholes formula, and the nonarbitrage pricing of options both for securities that pay dividends and for those whose prices are subject to randomly occurring jumps. A new approach for estimating the volatility parameter of the geometric Brownian motion is also discussed. Later chapters treat risk-neutral (nonarbitrage) pricing of exotic options - both by Monte Carlo simulation and by multiperiod binomial approximation models for European and American style options\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "Math Wonderland is a museum of interactive mathematical models in Hokkaido, Japan, founded by one of the authors, Jin Akiyama, in 2003. The models in Wonderland, many of which have been exhibited all over Japan and in cities around the world, are meant to help children and young adults discover and experience the wonders of mathematics. This book is centered around the experiences of three fictional middle-school students during a visit to Wonderland. They spend a day in Wonderland, handling the interactive models and participating in the activities offered there. At the end of the day, they leave with a genuine appreciation of mathematics gained from witnessing its beauty, applicability and inevitability. This book is an important contribution to the genre because it presents mathematics and models that have never before appeared in books in the same category: reversible solids, plane tiling with developments of tetrahedrons, and double-packable solids, which are derived from the authors' own research papers published in mathematics journals. It is designed to entertain, inform and even teach some mathematics. Although it is targeted at young adults, parents and teachers may learn something from the book as well. "

It is hoped that the infusion of new insights from mathematical scientists and physicists will accelerate progress in imaging. Incorporating input from dozens of biomedical researchers who described what they perceived as key open problems of imaging that are amenable to attack by mathematical scientists and physicists, this book introduces the frontiers of biomedical imaging, especially the imaging of dynamic physiological functions, to the educated nonspecialist. Ten imaging modalities are covered, from the well-established (e.g., CAT scanning, MRI) to the more speculative (e.g., electrical and magnetic source imaging). For each modality, mathematics and physics research challenges are identified and a short list of suggested reading offered. Two additional chapters offer visions of the next generation of surgical and interventional techniques and of image processing. A final chapter provides an overview of mathematical issues that cut across the various modalities. "

The author assumes no prior knowledge of probability and presents all the necessary preliminary material simply and clearly in chapters on probability, normal random variables, and the geometric Brownian motion model that underlies the Black-Scholes theory. He carefully explains the concept of arbitrage with many examples; he then presents the arbitrage theorem and uses it, along with a multiperiod binomial approximation of geometric Brownian motion, to obtain a simple derivation of the Black-Scholes call option formula. Simplified derivations are given for the delta hedging strategy, the partial derivatives of the Black-Scholes formula, and the nonarbitrage pricing of options both for securities that pay dividends and for those whose prices are subject to randomly occurring jumps. A new approach for estimating the volatility parameter of the geometric Brownian motion is also discussed. Later chapters treat risk-neutral (nonarbitrage) pricing of exotic options - both by Monte Carlo simulation and by multiperiod binomial approximation models for European and American style options\"-- Provided by publisher.

                "Annotation Just as macroeconomic models describe the overall economy within a changing, or dynamic, framework, the models themselves change over time. In this text Stephen J. Turnovsky reviews in depth several early models as well as a representation of more recent models. They include traditional (backward-looking) models, linear rational expectations (future-looking) models, intertemporal optimization models, endogenous growth models, and continuous time stochastic models. The author uses examples from both closed and open economies. Whereas others commonly introduce models in a closed context, tacking on a brief discussion of the model in an open economy, Turnovsky integrates the two perspectives throughout to reflect the increasingly international outlook of the field. This new edition has been extensively revised. It contains a new chapter on optimal monetary and fiscal policy, and the coverage of growth theory has been expanded substantially. The range of growth models considered has been extended, with particular attention devoted to transitional dynamics and nonscale growth. The book includes cutting-edge research and unpublished data, including much of the author's own work. "

It is widely acknowledged that students from Singapore do well in mathematics in international studies. This book provides readers with a glimpse of students from Singapore who are at the other end of the ability spectrum. The book is based on a study that explored the mathematics content knowledge of Primary 4 low attainers in mathematics, their behaviours, affects and home backgrounds, and learning experiences. Based on the findings of the study, the book has recommendations for teachers of low attainers in primary mathematics. This book serves as a must-have resource for teachers and graduate students in Singapore who are working with or studying low attainers in primary mathematics. It also makes a worthy contribution towards literature on low attainers in the field of mathematics education. "

We can quantify the risk that is hedged and the risk that is left as the residual exposure. If we learn to view all financial trades and securities as engineered packages of building blocks, then we can analyze in which structures some parts may be cheap and some may be rich.

Is there anything to technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and other supposedly time-tested methods of picking stocks? How can one quantify risks? What are the most common scams? What light do fractals, network theory, and common psychological foibles shed on investor behavior? Are there any approaches to investing that truly outperform the major indexes?
