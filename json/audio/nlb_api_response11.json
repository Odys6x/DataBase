                "From the finance editor of  The New York Times , an examination of Bill Gates\u2014one of the most powerful, fascinating, and contradictory figures of the past four decades\u2014and an eye-opening exploration of our national fixation on billionaires.  Few billionaires have been in the public eye for as long, and in as many guises, as Bill Gates. At first heralded as a tech visionary, the Microsoft cofounder next morphed into a ruthless capitalist, only to change yet again when he fashioned himself into a global do-gooder. Along the way, Gates forever influenced how we think about tech founders, as the products they make and the ideas they sell continue to dominate our lives. Through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, he also set a new standard for high-profile, billionaire philanthropy. But there is more to Gates's story, and here, Das's revelatory reporting shows us that billionaires have secrets and philanthropy can have a dark side.    Drawing upon hundreds of interviews with current and former employees of the Gates Foundation, Microsoft, academics, nonprofits, and those with insight into the Gates universe, Das delves into Gates's relationships with Warren Buffett, Jeffrey Epstein, Melinda French Gates, and others, to uncover the truths behind the public persona. In telling Gates's story, Das also provides a new way to think about how billionaires wield their power, manipulate their image, and pursue philanthropy to become heroes, repair damaged reputations, and direct policy to achieve their preferred outcomes.   Insightful, illuminating, and timely,  Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King  is an important story of money and government, wealth and power, and media and image, and the ways in which the world's richest people hold us in their thrall.

                "A stunning investigation and indictment of a segment of the United States' foreign lobbying industry, and the threat to end democracy.  For years, one group of Americans has worked as foot-soldiers for the most authoritarian regimes around the planet. In the process, they've not only entrenched dictatorships and spread kleptocratic networks, but they've secretly guided U.S. policy without the rest of America even being aware. And now, some of them have begun turning their sights on American democracy itself. These Americans are known as foreign lobbyists, and many of them spent years ushering dictatorships directly into the halls of Washington, all while laundering the reputations of the most heinous, repressive regimes in the process. These foreign lobbyists include figures like Ivy Lee, the inventor of the public relations industry\u2014a man who whitewashed Mussolini, opened doors to the Soviets, and advised the Nazis on how to sway American audiences. They include people like Paul Manafort, who invented lobbying as we know it\u2014and who then took his talents to autocrats from Ukraine to the Philippines, and then back to the White House. And they now include an increasing number of Americans elsewhere: in law firms and consultancies, among PR specialists and former lawmakers, and even within think tanks and universities. In  Foreign Agents , Casey Michel shines a light on these foreign lobbyists as some of them\u2014after decades of installing dictators and corrupting American policy\u2014embark on their next mission: to end America's democratic experiment, once and for all.

So pervasive has it become that, for most people, it has no name. It seems unavoidable, like a natural law.

                "The crucial need to substitute true leadership for bad management practices such as Management By Objectives (MBO) and the use of fear is now well known and was often championed by Dr. W. Edwards Deming. The executives of these organizations might give permission for the tools of Lean and Six Sigma to be taught but many of them still refuse to look in a mirror and change their own leadership style. They have built a \"fa\u00e7ade of excellence\" that crumbles quickly whenever a bit of chaos is introduced. Not being able to sustain improvements over the long term is one of the top complaints from improvement professionals. What ingredient is missing that prohibits changes to occur throughout the leadership ranks that might create a culture that embraces teamwork, collaboration, and improvement? To start, what exactly do we mean by leadership? Leadership actually has many dimensions and several definitions. This book explores four different styles of leadership that includes \"The Crisis Leader,\" \"The Idea Gathering Leader,\" \"The Team Forming Leader,\" and \"The Empowerment Leader.\" Each of the four styles is appropriate when given a certain set of circumstances. The goal is to shift the organization, including the leaders and all of the employees at every level, toward collaboration and empowerment. "

                "A  Fortune  magazine journalist draws on his expertise and extensive contacts among the companies and scientists at the forefront of artificial intelligence to offer dramatic predictions of AI's impact over the next decade, from reshaping our economy and the way we work, learn, and create to unknitting our social fabric, jeopardizing our democracy, and fundamentally altering the way we think.  Within the next five years, Jeremy Kahn predicts, AI will disrupt almost every industry and enterprise, with vastly increased efficiency and productivity. It will restructure the workforce, making AI copilots a must for every knowledge worker. It will revamp education, meaning children around the world can have personal, portable tutors. It will revolutionize health care, making individualized, targeted pharmaceuticals more affordable. It will compel us to reimagine how we make art, compose music, and write and publish books. The potential of generative AI to extend our skills, talents, and creativity as humans is undeniably exciting and promising.   But while this new technology has a bright future, it also casts a dark and fearful shadow. AI will provoke pervasive, disruptive, potentially devastating knock-on effects. Leveraging his unrivaled access to the leaders, scientists, futurists, and others who are making AI a reality, Kahn will argue that if not carefully designed and vigilantly regulated AI will deepen income inequality, depressing wages while imposing winner-take-all markets across much of the economy. AI risks undermining democracy, as truth is overtaken by misinformation, racial bias, and harmful stereotypes. Continuing a process begun by the internet, AI will rewire our brains, likely inhibiting our ability to think critically, to remember, and even to get along with one another\u2014unless we all take decisive action to prevent this from happening.   Much as Michael Lewis's classic  The New New Thing  offered a prescient, insightful, and eminently readable account of life inside the dot-com bubble,  Mastering AI  delivers much-needed guidance for anyone eager to understand the AI boom\u2014and what comes next.

                "The first and definitive history of the use of food in United States law and politics as a weapon of conquest and control, a  Fast Food Nation  for the Black Lives Matter era   In 1779, to subjugate Indigenous nations, George Washington ordered his troops to \u201cruin their crops now in the ground and prevent their planting more.\u201d Destroying harvests is just one way that the United States has used food as a political tool. Trying to prevent enslaved people from rising up, enslavers restricted their consumption, providing only enough to fuel labor. Since the Great Depression, school lunches have served as dumping grounds for unwanted agricultural surpluses.  From frybread to government cheese,  Ruin Their Crops on the Ground  draws on over fifteen years of research to argue that U.S. food law and policy have created and maintained racial and social inequality. In an epic, sweeping account, Andrea Freeman, who pioneered the term \u201cfood oppression,\u201d moves from colonization to slavery to the Americanization of immigrant food culture, to the commodities supplied to Native reservations, to milk as a symbol of white supremacy. She traces the long-standing alliance between the government and food industries that have produced gaping racial health disparities, and she shows how these practices continue to this day, through the marketing of unhealthy goods that target marginalized communities, causing diabetes, high blood pressure, and premature death.   Ruin Their Crops on the Ground  is a groundbreaking addition to the history and politics of food. It will permanently upend the notion that we freely and equally choose what we put on our plates. "

Within a decade, nearly half of all American farmland will change hands as an older generation of farmers steps aside. In their place, a groundswell of new growers will face numerous challenges, including soil degradation, insufficient income, and investors devouring farmland at a staggering pace. These new farmers are embracing regenerative agriculture\u2014the holistic approach to growing food that restores the soil and biodiversity\u2014in the movement to reclaim our health and the planet's. But can their efforts help reverse an epidemic of diet-related disease, food inequality, and even climate change? To answer that question and more, award-winning journalist Jennifer Grayson embedded herself in a groundbreaking farmer training program, then embarked on this investigative journey. The diverse array of farmers, graziers, and food activists whom she profiles here are working toward better, more sustainable foodways for all. From a one-acre market garden in Oregon to activists reviving food sovereignty in South Carolina,  A Call to Farms  tells the captivating story of these new agrarians finding hope and purpose in reconnecting to the land and striving to improve the future of American food.

What's gone wrong with our media? The answer: its owners. From William Randolph Hearst to Elon Musk, from the British press barons to colonial upstarts Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch, media proprietors have manipulated the news to accumulate wealth and influence as they meddled with democracy.   Eric Beecher knows the news business from bottom to top. He has been a journalist, editor and media proprietor (of Text Media and  Crikey ), with the rare distinction of having both worked for and been sued (unsuccessfully) by the Murdochs.   This book reveals the distorted role of the media moguls of the past two centuries: their techniques, strategies, behind-closed-doors machinations, and indulgent lifestyles. It explains how they have exploited the shield of the freedom of the press to undermine journalism \u2013 and truth.   In an era of fake news, AI and misinformation, this is democracy's chillingly important story: how a small coterie of flawed and narcissistic moguls created a shadow of power that has contributed to making the media an agent of mistrust.

                "A simple guide to a smarter strategy for the individual investor     A Wealth of Common Sense  sheds a refreshing light on investing, and shows you how a simplicity-based framework can lead to better investment decisions. The financial market is a complex system, but that doesn't mean it requires a complex strategy; in fact, this false premise is the driving force behind many investors' market mistakes. Information is important, but understanding and perspective are the keys to better decision-making. This book describes the proper way to view the markets and your portfolio, and shows you the simple strategies that make investing more profitable, less confusing, and less time-consuming. Without the burden of short-term performance benchmarks, individual investors have the advantage of focusing on the long view, and the freedom to construct the kind of portfolio that will serve their investment goals best. This book proves how complex strategies essentially waste these advantages, and provides an alternative game plan for those ready to simplify.   Complexity is often used as a mechanism for talking investors into unnecessary purchases, when all most need is a deeper understanding of conventional options. This book explains which issues you actually should pay attention to, and which ones are simply used for an illusion of intelligence and control.   Keep up with\u2014or beat\u2014professional money managers   Exploit stock market volatility to your utmost advantage   Learn where advisors and consultants fit into smart strategy   Build a portfolio that makes sense for your particular situation   You don't have to outsmart the market if you can simply outperform it. Cut through the confusion and noise and focus on what actually matters.  A Wealth of Common Sense  clears the air, and gives you the insight you need to become a smarter, more successful investor.

                "The Port of Los Angeles is all around us. Objects we use on a daily basis pass through it: furniture, apparel, electronics, automobiles, and much more. Yet despite its centrality to our world, the port and the story of its making have been neglected in histories of the United States. In  A Machine to Move Ocean and Earth , historian James Tejani corrects that significant omission, charting the port's rise out of the mud and salt marsh of San Pedro estuary. By the mid-nineteenth century, Americans had identified the West Coast as the republic's destiny, a gateway to the riches of the Pacific. Tejani demonstrates how San Pedro came to be seen as all-important to the nation's future. It was not virgin land, but dominated by powerful Mexican estates that would not be dislodged easily. Yet American scientists would wrest control of the estuary and set the scene for the violence, inequality, and engineering marvels to come. San Pedro was no place for a harbor, Tejani reveals. The port was carved in defiance of nature, using new engineering techniques and massive mechanical dredgers. Tejani vividly describes how a wild coast was made into the engine of American power.  A Machine to Move Ocean and Earth  is must-listen for anyone who seeks to understand what the United States was, what it is now, and what it will be. "

                "The original Visible Learning research concluded that one of the most important influencers of student achievement is how teachers think about learning and their own role. In  Ten Mindframes for Visible Learning , John Hattie and Klaus Zierer define the 10 behaviors or mindframes that teachers need to adopt in order to maximize student success. These include:  thinking of and evaluating your impact on students' learning;   the importance of assessment and feedback for teachers;   working collaboratively and the sense of community;   the notion that learning needs to be challenging;   engaging in dialogue and the correct balance between talking and listening;   conveying the success criteria to learners;   building positive relationships.    These powerful mindframes, which should underpin every action in schools, are founded on the principle that teachers are evaluators, change agents, learning experts, and seekers of feedback who are constantly engaged with dialogue and challenge.   This practical audiobook will show any school exactly how to implement Hattie's mindframes to maximize success. Narrated by listener favorite Brian Arens.   \u00a92018 John Hattie and Klaus Zierer.

When Jessica Chen entered the workforce, she felt like everything she had been taught growing up in a Quiet Culture household\u2014where deference, humility, harmony, and dogged hard work were praised \u2014 failed to set her up for success in the \u201creal world.\u201d Her ingrained values were in direct contrast with what was actually needed to stand out in a Loud Culture workplace. The result? Feeling underappreciated, passed over for opportunities and promotions, and completely stuck. Building on the lessons she learned as an award-winning TV news journalist, Chen \u2014 who now speaks at Fortune 100 companies and whose LinkedIn Learning courses have been watched by over 2 million people \u2014 introduces a new way of getting noticed at work, without being loud, aggressive, or boastful. In  Smart, Not Loud , Chen teaches readers how they can look within, to the values they already hold, to more effectively show up. Through instructive anecdotes and research-backed principles, readers will learn to:  speak up at meetings using the 4A Sequence (active listening, acknowledging, anchoring, and answering);\u00a0  advocate for themselves with tact;  build strategic relationships to enhance credibility and get picked for the best projects;  and master the five elements of voice\u2014pitch, rate, intensity, inflection, and quality\u2014to be the kind of communicator others want to listen to.  Packed with actionable tips,  Smart, Not Loud  unveils a new path to getting noticed and getting ahead at work. This is the road map readers need to authentically show up in the workplace and truly feel seen. "

                "Based on extensive research and real-world examples, this book upends accepted wisdom about how to achieve success when launching a startup or creating a new product.   The breakthrough concepts of  Pattern Breakers  come from the observations of Mike Maples Jr., a seasoned venture capitalist, who noticed something strange. Start-ups like Twitter, Twitch, and Lyft had achieved extraordinary success despite their disregard for \"best practices.\" In contrast, other startups deemed highly promising often failed, even when they seemed to do everything right.  Seeking answers, Maples and coauthor Peter Ziebelman set out to discover the hidden forces that drive extraordinary start-up success. Pattern-breaking success, they reveal, demands a different mindset and actions to harness developments others miss or that may, at first, seem crazy.  Pattern Breakers  is filled with firsthand storytelling about initial interactions with some of the most transformative start-ups of recent times. Maples and Ziebelman challenge us to rethink how to transcend the ordinary and achieve the extraordinary. "

It introduces the Head, Heart, and Hands Listening model as a vital tool to amplify effective listening in coaching practice. Accessible and applicable, the book explores the three listening modalities of Head, Heart, and Hands as active, though largely unconscious, lenses that inform the potency of our listening. Dakin-Neal argues that once coaches identify \"how\" they listen, they can assist their clients in more targeted ways to positively impact their personal and professional lives. Chapters are divided into the three listening modalities, Head, Heart, and Hands, and are filled with case studies, stories, reflective questions, and exercises from the author's experience to help coaches strengthen their listening skills. The book also includes a comprehensive listening assessment for coaches to use in practice. This book is essential for coaches in practice and in training as well as organizational psychologists, HR professionals, and those working within corporations. "

But our dissatisfaction at work usually stems from a deeper psychological need that\u2019s not being met at work, like not getting the recognition you deserve. In  Job Therapy , Dr. Tessa West helps you figure out the real reason you\u2019re unhappy and shows you how to find a new position in which you\u2019ll thrive, whether in a different role, company, or new industry altogether. Through her research interviewing thousands of people who have recently switched jobs or undergone career changes, she found there are five common sources of career frustration:   having an  identity crisis  \u2013 does your sense of self no longer match your job?  you\u2019ve  drifted-apart  \u2013 do you no longer recognize the job you once loved?   you\u2019re  torn between places  \u2013 are you taking on too many roles at work, switching tasks too often, or stuck between two paths?  you\u2019re  the runner up  \u2013 do you always feel like you keep coming in second?   you\u2019re  the underappreciated star  \u2013 are you crushing it at work, but the people around you aren\u2019t recognizing your performance?   Dr. West will guide you through a working week audit to help identify your unique psychological stressors and use that knowledge to understand what you want your future career to look like. Presenting cutting-edge insights on networking and hiring, from Dr. West\u2019s interviews with over 1,500 professional recruiters,  Job Therapy  will help you land\u00a0your best role yet \u2013 one that guarantees happiness for years to come.  *Includes a downloadable PDF of quizzes from the book.

Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, Friedman was both a highly respected economist and a prominent public intellectual, the leader of a revolution in economic and political thought that argued robustly in favor of virtues of free markets and laissez-faire policies.  Milton Friedman on Economics: Selected Papers  collects a variety of Friedman's papers on topics in economics that were originally published in the  Journal of Political Economy . Opening with Friedman's 1977 Nobel Lecture, the volume spans nearly the whole of his career, incorporating papers from as early as 1948 and as late as 1990. An excellent introduction to Friedman's economic thought,  Milton Friedman  will be essential for anyone tracing the course of twentieth-century economics and politics. "

                "Fifteen years after Bernie Madoff's arrest, renowned investigative journalist Richard Behar delivers the definitive account of history's largest, longest-running financial fraud\u2014featuring audio excerpts from archival interviews with Bernie Madoff from prison.  Some $68 billion evaporated during Bernie Madoff's epic confidence game. Two people were driven to suicide in the wake of the Ponzi Scheme's exposure. Others went to prison. But there has never been a satisfying accounting for how Bernie got away with so much, for so long. Until now.    Richard Behar's relationship with Madoff began in 2011 with a simple email request from the inmate. By the time Madoff died in 2021, he had sent Behar more than 300 emails and dozens of handwritten letters, participated in some fifty phone conversations, and sat for three in-person jailhouse interviews\u2014a level of access provided to no other reporter. Behar also established relationships with hundreds of regulators, prosecutors, FBI agents, investors, Wall Street experts, ex-employees of Madoff's, family members, school classmates, and others.    The result is the final word on the criminal behind history's most enduring fraud\u2014and on those who believed him, covered for him, or locked him up. Behar illuminates not only the fraud's origins\u2014decades earlier than Madoff claimed in his confession\u2014but also the complicity of investors, Wall Street insiders, family members, and some of the largest banks in the US and Europe.    Shocking, infuriating, riveting (and at times absurdly funny),  Madoff  shows us how Bernie ensnared thousands of investors. As Behar's dogged reporting over the last fifteen years makes clear, however, there aren't many innocents left standing by the end of this tale. Just about everyone involved is guilty, at a minimum, of humanity's most consistent weakness: greed. "

But many leaders are surprised to find themselves bogged down by people problems. They can't get people to row in the same direction\u2014or row at all. They have a nagging sense that the team isn't reaching its full potential. This book is a primer for busy leaders who want actionable ways to build a better team with the people they have. Sarah Thurber and Blair Miller combine their decades of team-building experience with research from the fields of cognitive diversity and creative problem solving to help people lead teams that collaborate, innovate, and get results. Their advice? If you want to lead a good team, don't follow your instincts. Follow the science. Built on research from their popular FourSight\u00ae system\u2014used by Nike, NASA, and Navy SEALs\u2014 Good Team, Bad Team  examines over 6 million data points on why people solve the same problem so differently. The data reveals unconscious problem-solving patterns which, left unmanaged, can cause conflict and stall progress. Once understood, they can help diverse thinkers achieve extraordinary results.  Good Team, Bad Team  is the must-read leadership toolkit for leaders who want their people to take on big challenges\u2014together. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin.  Facebook knew it had a problem. The company had been humiliated by headlines, painted as complicit in the manipulation of democratic voting and an assault on the global social fabric. Their stated mission was to connect people, but they couldn't afford to destroy society in the process. And so they hired a small team to make sure they didn't repeat the same mistakes. From the Wall Street Journal reporter whose explosive stories have rocked Facebook and its leadership, this is the story of the Civic Integrity Team: a select band of engineers, coders, economists, and experts hired to peer inside the company's secretive algorithms for the first time and find out what exactly was going wrong. They were successful. Too successful. The Integrity unit discovered proof that Facebook distorted and amplified the basest of human impulses. The company was not merely providing a platform for bad actors but amplifying their power for profit. Enduring personal trauma and professional resistance in their often lonely and dark investigations, the Integrity team nevertheless isolated many of Facebook's worst problems, complete with tentative and hopeful steps to solve them - only to discover that they were set up to fail, and would have to take matters into their own hands. \u00a92023 Jeff Horwitz (P)2023 Penguin Audio.

Its gross domestic product per capita has soared from just US$517 (S$697) in 1965, to US$64,582 (S$87,128) in 2018. Impressed, visiting university students from Mexico and the United States, in early 2019, asked the city state's Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh for its secret of success. His reply: there was not a single secret but many, which he would consider curating a new book on. The result: Fifty Secrets of Singapore's Success. The collection of 50 essays, written by leaders and experts in their fields, sheds light on how the small state has scored significant success in not only economics but also eight other areas. Among other things, Singapore is one of the world's least corrupt countries, has one of the highest home ownership rates worldwide \u2014 of more than 90 per cent \u2014 and has world-class schools, healthcare and environments. Singapore has also been a good global citizen. It has played a significant role in the development of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the United Nations (UN), Singapore has played a leadership role in the negotiations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the UN Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation (also known as the Singapore Convention on Mediation) and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.

When Reah Bravo began working at the  Charlie Rose  show, the open secret of Rose's conduct towards women didn't deter her from pursuing a position she thought could launch her career in broadcast journalism. She considered herself more than capable of handling any unprofessional behavior that might come her way. But she soon learned a devastating truth: we don't always react to abusive situations as we imagine we will.   When we live in a society where many feminist ideals are mainstream and women hold positions of power, how is it possible that sexual misconduct remains so prevalent? When many employers mandate trainings to prevent harassment of all kinds, why is workplace abuse still so rampant?   Weaving her own experience with those of other women and insights from experts, Bravo reveals the psychological and cultural forces that make us all enablers of a sexist and dangerous status quo. By bringing these hard truths into the light,  Complicit  charts an accessible path toward a better future. "

                "'The customs officer told me that I needed to leave samples of what I was exporting with him. I was forced to leave the floppy disk of the software with him. The diligent officer immediately planted a stapler pin through the floppy disk and attached it to the form, thereby destroying the media and rendering it unreadable. For the longest time, everybody's understanding of software differed immensely. This confusion continued into the 1980s, and it was getting challenging to grow the business. The more I met young software entrepreneurs, the more I realized that my frustration was not unique. Something had to be done.'  In the mid-1970s, a young, twenty-something man living an American dream threw away a lucrative job as a database manager and came back to India. At that time, India had no IT industry to speak of; computers were a novelty, and the nation was trapped in socio-economic backwardness and a labyrinthine License Raj.  As young Harish Mehta struggled to find his stride, he realized that India's nascent and fragmented IT industry acutely needed a unified voice that could speak to the government, change laws and harness the country's potential. In an unlikely alliance of headstrong and competing young professionals, he united other IT entrepreneurs to envision a world-beating association that would revolutionize Indian IT: NASSCOM.  The Maverick Effect is the extraordinary story of this band of dreamers who joined hands to transform a nation while also changing the lens through which the world looked at India. Valued at a staggering $200 billion today, the Indian  IT industry directly employs more than four million people. It is the largest forex earner and has helped millions of Indians beat poverty and rise to the middle-income group. Honest, open and inspiring, Harish Mehta's journey proves that no vision is impossible if unrelenting, kindred spirits unite. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin. A  New York Times  bestselling author and leading expert on market risk outlines new rules of investing for the forward-thinking.  From Wall Street to Downing Street, the fantasy of an eventual 'return to normal' is still alive and well, nurtured by dangerously outdated theories. But the economic world as we know it - and the rules that govern it - are over. And few are prepared. Lawrence McDonald got a real-world education in market risk when, as a Lehman Brothers VP, he watched the firm ignore flashing warning signs before its collapse. Now, he unveils the predictive model he developed in the aftermath, outlining actionable trading ideas for a radically reshaped economy. Readers will discover:  Why inflation will stay near 3-5% for the next decade  Why oil prices will remain at historic highs for the foreseeable future  Why hard assets and rare minerals like lithium and cobalt will outperform growth stocks and passive investment strategies  Why America will likely lose its position as a global superpower and holder of the world's premier reserve currency  Rather than merely doomsaying,  How to Listen When Markets Speak  equips readers to make sense of our current moment, resist reactionary narratives and baseless analysis, and pounce on a new investing playbook. \u00a92024 James Robinson & Lawrence McDonald (P)2024 Penguin Audio.

                "A sweeping, narrative history of Black wealth and the economic discrimination embedded in America's financial system.    The early 2020s will long be known as a period of racial reflection. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, Americans of all backgrounds joined together in historic demonstrations in the streets, discussions in the workplace, and conversations at home about the financial gaps that remain between white and Black Americans. This deeply investigated book shows the scores of setbacks that have held the Black-white wealth gap in place\u2014from enslavement to redlining to banking discrimination\u2014and, ultimately, the reversals that occurred in the mid-2020s as the push for racial equity became a polarized political debate.  Fifteen Cents on the Dollar follows the lives of four Black Millennial professionals and a banking company founded with the stated mission of closing the Black-white wealth gap. That company, known as Greenwood, a reference to the historic Black Wall Street district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, generated immense excitement and hope among people looking for new ways of business that might lead to greater equity. But the twists and turns of Greenwood's journey also raise tough questions about what equality really means.  Seasoned journalist-academics Louise Story and Ebony Reed present a nuanced portrait of Greenwood's founders\u2014the entertainment executive Ryan Glover; the Grammy-winning rapper Michael Render, better known as Killer Mike; and the Civil Rights leader and two-term Atlanta mayor, Andrew Young\u2014along with new revelations about their lives, careers, and families going back to the Civil War. Equally engaging are the stories of the lesser-known individuals\u2014a female tech employee from rural North Carolina trying to make it in a big city; a rising leader at the NAACP whose father is in prison; an owner of a BBQ stand in Atlanta fighting to keep his home; and a Black man in a biracial marriage grappling with his roots when his father is shot by the police.  In chronicling these staggering injustices, Fifteen Cents on the Dollar shows why so little progress has been made on the wealth gap and provides insights Americans should consider if they want lasting change.

                "From an experienced organizational psychologist comes a unique guide to learning how to better read and understand people and make improved, more informed business decisions about them\u2014including choosing the right employees, fostering relationships in the workplace, resolving conflicts more effectively, and optimizing your performance on the job\u2014using the science of personality.   Psychologists widely agree that five key traits define our personalities\u2014intellect, emotionality, sociability, drive, and diligence. Unlike emotions, which are transitory in nature, these traits determine our behaviors, including our motivations, social inclinations, reactions to crisis or complexity, patterns of thinking, and more.  Organizational psychologist Dr. Richard Davis is an expert in assessing personalities. He has spent decades advising business leaders and evaluating executives from some of the world's biggest companies, including Amazon, Target, Best Buy, Under Armour, Meta, Starbucks, Nike, LVMH, and the NBA. Over the course of his career, he has helped numerous executives make tough, highly consequential hiring calls based on personality. A company's board might want its next CEO to be decisive, focused, and a strong communicator. Investors backing a start-up might want a leader who is not only a visionary but also a team player who doesn't retaliate when given constructive feedback. That's where he comes in. As a result of his life's work, Dr. Davis has developed not only a unique perspective on what human personality is, but an indispensable toolkit for analyzing it, and using the information effectively.  In Good Judgment, he brings his expertise to you. Dr. Davis explains what the science of personality is and how it works, and how all of us can use it to improve our working relationships, careers, and lives. Whether you're a novice manager looking to hire your first assistant, a board member in need of the ideal CEO, an angel investor trying to choose between two different startups, or a new parent selecting a pediatrician, understanding the science of personality and how to utilize it is the key to exercising good judgment\u2014at work and in life.

                "By the New York Times's Global Economics Correspondent, an extraordinary journey to understand the worldwide supply chain \u2014 exposing both the fascinating pathways of manufacturing and transportation that bring products to your doorstep, and the ruthless business logic that has left local communities at the mercy of a complex and fragile network for their basic necessities.    \"\"A tale that will change how you look at the world.\"\" \u2014Mark Leibovich    One of Foreign Policy's \"\"Most Anticipated Books of 2024\"\"   How does the wealthiest country on earth run out of protective gear in the middle of a public health catastrophe? How do its parents find themselves unable to locate crucially needed infant formula? How do its largest companies spend billions of dollars making cars that no one can drive for a lack of chips?  The last few years have radically highlighted the intricacy and fragility of the global supply chain. Enormous ships were stuck at sea, warehouses overflowed, and delivery trucks stalled. The result was a scarcity of everything from breakfast cereal to medical devices, from frivolous goods to lifesaving necessities. And while the scale of the pandemic shock was unprecedented, it underscored the troubling reality that the system was fundamentally at risk of descending into chaos all along. And it still is. Sabotaged by financial interests, loss of transparency in markets, and worsening working conditions for the people tasked with keeping the gears turning, our global supply chain has become perpetually on the brink of collapse.  In How the World Ran Out of Everything, award-winning journalist Peter S. Goodman reveals the fascinating innerworkings of our supply chain and the factors that have led to its constant, dangerous vulnerability. His reporting takes readers deep into the elaborate system, showcasing the triumphs and struggles of the human players who operate it\u2014from factories in Asia and an almond grower in Northern California, to a group of striking railroad workers in Texas, to a truck driver who Goodman accompanies across hundreds of miles of the Great Plains. Through their stories, Goodman weaves a powerful argument for reforming a supply chain to become truly reliable and resilient, demanding a radical redrawing of the bargain between labor and shareholders, and deeper attention paid to how we get the things we need.  From one of the most respected economic journalists working today, How the World Ran Out of Everything is a fiercely smart, deeply informative look at how our supply chain operates, and why its reform is crucial\u2014not only to avoid dysfunction in our day to day lives, but to protect the fate of our global fortunes.

Think of your most valuable skill, the thing you can reliably do under pressure to deliver results. How did you learn it?  Whatever your job \u2013 plumber, attorney, teacher, surgeon \u2013 decades of research show that you achieved mastery by working with someone who knew more than you did. Formal learning\u2014school and books\u2014gave you conceptual knowledge, but you developed your skill by working with an expert.  Today, this essential bond is under threat. In our grail-like quest to optimize productivity with intelligent technologies like AI and robots, we are separating junior workers from experts in workplaces around the world. It's a looming multi-trillion-dollar problem that few are addressing, until now.  In The Skill Code, researcher and technologist Matt Beane reveals the hidden code that underwrites every successful expert-novice relationship. Beane has spent the last decade examining this unique bond in a variety of settings, from warehouses to surgical suites. He's found that just as the four amino acids are the building blocks of DNA, the three C's\u2014challenge, complexity, and connection\u2014are the basic components of how we develop our most valuable skills.  Whether you're an expert or a novice, this book will show you how to build skill more effectively \u2013 and how to make intelligent technologies part of the solution, not the problem. The Skill Code is an insightful must-read, with significant implications for how we will work and build skill in the twenty-first century\u2014a guide to help you not only survive but thrive.

She worked hand-in-hand with a founder who was a lightning rod for controversy\u2014OK, for stepping in it. She grew a chaotic company (Vanity Fair called it a \"pirate ship\") housed over a dentist's office outside of Boston that published giveaway papers into a juggernaut with more than 5 billion monthly video views and 225 million followers valued at 550 million dollars. Erika Ayers Badan calls herself a \"token CEO\", the rare female employee in the highest rank of a bro-roar sports and new media culture.  She's also a massive student of work: how to do it, how to be effective at it, how to get noticed, how to crush it, how to figure out what you love and do it as a job. She's figured it out, after big marketing jobs in large traditional corporations like Microsoft and AOL, for herself; she's figured it out for friends; she figured it out for the thousands of people who listened to her Barstool podcast, \"Token CEO\" every week. And in this book, she's figuring it out for everybody else.  With the verve and motivation of books like YOU ARE A BADASS and the smart, specific ideas of titles like ATOMIC HABITS, NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR CAREER is a real playbook. It's about how work really works and how you can get work to work for you. It's about thank you notes and thankless tasks, the energy in meetings and energy vampires, how to pick a boss and how to get a boss to pick you. It's about being all in (but not bringing your whole self to work\u2014some of you is better left at home) and becoming valuable to your workplace. It's about participating\u2014with your brain, your skills, your experience, and your willingness to pitch in and offer yourself up for something you may not even know how to do yet. It's about making your own luck at work.  NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR CAREER is for first-time job seekers who think no company will ever want them, people stuck in second or third jobs who don't know how to move on to the next thing, people who have the job they thought was their brass ring but who discovered it's not all that.  Her chapter titles include:  - Do Whatever Makes You Happy and F*ck Anyone Who Says Otherwise  - Know What Your Company is Paying You to Do  - Don't Be an Asshole at Work  - The Messy Stuff: Being Human, Getting Drunk, Sex, and Other Disaster Scenarios at Work  - Feedback is a Gift.

                "The dramatic story of an improbable gang of self-proclaimed \"degenerates\" who made WallStreetBets into a cultural movement that moved from the fringes of the internet to the center of Wall Street, upending the global financial markets and changing how an entire generation thinks about money, investing, and themselves.            Jaime Rogozinski and Jordan Zazzara were not what anyone would mistake for traditional financial power players. But they turned WallStreetBets, a subreddit focused on risky financial trading, into one of the most disruptive forces to bubble up from the fringes of the internet. This crude and unassuming message board harnessed the power of memes and trolling to create a new kind of online community. The group intertwined with the distrust and turmoil of our times and spoke to a generation of young men who were struggling to find their place in the world.   Deeply reported and fast moving, The Trolls of Wall Street is the suspenseful story of the people who made and lost millions, battling with each other\u2014and with Wall Street\u2014for power and status. It is a sobering account of how millions of young Americans became obsessed with money and the markets, casting a long and lasting influence over finance, politics, and popular culture. "

                "\"Entertaining and informative. Desai takes us on a journey through the fundamentals of finance, from asset pricing to risk and risk management, via options, mergers, debt, and bankruptcy.\"- John Lanchester, The New Yorker  \"A fascinating new perspective on modern finance,\" \u2014Oliver Hart, 2016 Nobel Laureate in Economics   \"Lucid, witty and delightfully erudite...From the French revolution to film noir, from the history of probability to Jane Austen and The Simpsons, this is an astonishing intellectual feast.\" \u2014Sebastian Mallaby, author of The Man Who Knew: The Life and Times of Alan Greenspan   Longlisted for 2017 Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year    A 2017 AMAZON PICK IN BUSINESS & LEADERSHIP   A WealthManagement.com BEST BUSINESS BOOK OF 2017   In 1688, essayist Josef de la Vega described finance as both \"the fairest and most deceitful business . . . the noblest and the most infamous in the world, the finest and most vulgar on earth.\"  The characterization of finance as deceitful, infamous, and vulgar still rings true today \u2013 particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But, what happened to the fairest, noblest, and finest profession that de la Vega saw?   De la Vega hit on an essential truth that has been forgotten: finance can be just as principled, life-affirming, and worthy as it can be fraught with questionable practices. Today, finance is shrouded in mystery for outsiders, while many insiders are uneasy with the disrepute of their profession. How can finance become more accessible and also recover its nobility?  Harvard Business School professor Mihir Desai, in his \"last lecture\" to the graduating Harvard MBA class of 2015, took up the cause of restoring humanity to finance. With incisive wit and irony, his lecture drew upon a rich knowledge of literature, film, history, and philosophy to explain the inner workings of finance in a manner that has never been seen before.  This book captures Desai's lucid exploration of the ideas of finance as seen through the unusual prism of the humanities. Through this novel, creative approach, Desai shows that outsiders can access the underlying ideas easily and insiders can reacquaint themselves with the core humanity of their profession.  The mix of finance and the humanities creates unusual pairings: Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope are guides to risk management; Jeff Koons becomes an advocate of leverage; and Mel Brooks's The Producers teaches us about fiduciary responsibility. In Desai's vision, the principles of finance also provide answers to critical questions in our lives. Among many surprising parallels, bankruptcy teaches us how to react to failure, the lessons of mergers apply to marriages, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model demonstrates the true value of relationships.  THE WISDOM OF FINANCE is a wholly unique book, offering a refreshing new perspective on one of the world's most complex and misunderstood professions. "

                "Unlike individuals or corporations that become insolvent, nations do not have access to bankruptcy protection from their creditors. When a country defaults on its debt, the international financial system is ill equipped to manage the crisis. Decisions by key individuals determine the fate of an entire national economy. A prime example is Argentina's 2001 default on $100 billion in bonds, which stands out for its messy outcomes and outsized impact on sovereign debt markets, sovereign debt law, and IMF policy. Default is the riveting story of Argentina's sovereign debt drama, which reveals the obscure inner workings of sovereign debt restructuring. This detailed case study describes the intense fight over the role of the IMF in Argentina's 2005 debt restructuring and the ensuing bitter decade of litigation with holdout creditors, demonstrating that outcomes for sovereign debt are determined by a complex interplay between financial markets, governments, the IMF, the press, and the courts. This cautionary tale lays bare the institutional, political, and legal pressures that come into play when a country cannot repay its debts. It offers a deeper understanding of how global financial capitalism functions for those who work in or study debt markets, international finance, international relations, and international law. "

The problem was he lacked a manual for how to achieve it\u2014 so, he set out to create one himself. He talked to Bill Belichick about how to prepare, Steph Curry about how to practice, Sue Bird about how to develop resilience, and Mark Cuban about how to build a career with longevity. From the wisdom of these and other legends, and through his own\u2014often painful\u2014trial and error, he forged himself into a true champion. And in doing so, he wrote the manual he always wanted.  The Way of The Champion  is the synthesis of everything Rabil learned on his path to becoming one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time. But this is not merely a sports book. It is a guide to embodying a champion's mindset\u2014in sports, in business, and in relationships. According to Paul Rabil, \u201cNo one is born to be a champion. It can only be earned\u2014 through equal parts philosophy, execution, and sheer determination. I've won and lost championships, business deals, and relationships. I've learned that our best moments come after we've faced our most devestating defeats\u2014 when we choose to rise with unwavering resolve. That's the way of the champion.\" "

                "In Fire in the Hole!, Bob Parsons, founder of GoDaddy, shares his story of extraordinary success as a self-made serial entrepreneur.   Born in the tough town of East Baltimore to parents who were inveterate gamblers, billionaire philanthropist Bob Parsons' early years were marked by hardship and financial struggle. While he vowed his own children would never lack for anything, never did he imagine the wealth he would one day amass as the founder of Parsons Technology, GoDaddy, PXG Golf, and YAM Worldwide.  In his literary debut, Fire in the Hole!, this extraordinary entrepreneur recounts the exploits of his youth, his hellish days at the mercy of Catholic school nuns, his harrowing tour of combat duty in Vietnam as a US Marine, his pioneering contributions to the software and internet industries, and his latest ventures in power sports, golf, real estate, and marketing.  Along the way, we witness his remarkable resilience as he copes with his mother's mental illness and his father's struggles, battles PTSD resulting from both his childhood and war traumas, and mounts a quest to find new and effective treatments for himself and others who suffer from this affliction. He strongly supports veterans organizations, and believing in the concept of paying it forward, has awarded grants to more than ninety-six charities and organizations worldwide through the Bob & Renee Parsons Foundation.  Perhaps the only thing that has come easy to Parsons is his gift for storytelling. His reflections are at turns heartbreaking, heartwarming, hilarious, and inspiring. If ever there were a story about a self-made man whose wealth can be measured as much by the contents of his heart as by the contents of his bank account, this is it.  More than anything, Fire in the Hole! is a \"can't put down\" good read!. "

                "A  New York Times  investigative reporter wades into the murky, pixelated waters of the multibillion-dollar NFT market\u2014the virtual casino that sprang up overnight in 2020 and came crashing down, with all its celebrity hucksters, just two years later. A vibrant and witty exploration of the increasingly blurry line between art and money, artist and con artist, value and worthlessness. \u201cA perfect book to understand and to laugh at the craziness of the art world today.\" \u2014Jerry Saltz, author of  How to Be an Artist   In 2021, when the gavel fell at Christie\u2019s on the sale of Mike Winkelmann\u2019s  Everydays  series\u2014a compilation of five thousand digital artworks\u2014it made a thunderous announcement: Non-fungible tokens had arrived. The ludicrous world of  CryptoKitties  and Bored Apes had just produced a piece of art worth $69.3 million (at least according to the highest bidder). On that day, the traditional art market\u2014the largest unregulated market in the world\u2014put its stamp of approval on a very new and carnivalesque digital reality. But what did it mean for these two worlds to collide? Was it all just a money laundering scheme? And come on, what was that piece of digital flotsam  really  worth anyway? In  Token Supremacy,  Zachary Small works through these and other fascinating questions, tracing the crypto economy back to its origins in the 2008 financial crisis and the lineage of NFTs back to the first photographic negatives. Small describes jaw-dropping tales of heists, publicity stunts, and rug pulls, before zeroing in on the role of \"security tokens\" in the FTX scandal. Detours through art history provide insight into the mythmaking tactics that drive stratospheric auction sales and help the wealthy launder their finances (and reputations) through art.\u00a0And we cast an eye toward a future where NFTs have paved the way for a dangerous, new shadow banking system. A wild and spellbinding tour through a world that strains belief. "

                "Revolutionize the way you see disruption and change with a groundbreaking alternative to corporate instability from a lauded HR expert.      For decades, \"disruption\" and \"change\" have been seen as essential to business growth and success. In this provocative and incisive book, Ashley Goodall argues that what has become a sacred dogma is both wrong and harmful.    Whether it's a merger or re-org or a new office layout, change has become the ultimate easy button for leaders, who pursue it with abandon, unleashing a torrent of disruption on employees. The result is what he calls \"life in the blender\"\u2014a perpetual cycle of upheaval, uncertainty, and unease.    The problem with change, Goodall argues, is that a culture where everything from people to processes to strategic priorities are constantly in flux exerts a psychological toll that undermines motivation, productivity, and quality. And yet so accustomed are we to constant churn that we have become numb to its very real consequences.    Drawing on two decades spent leading HR organizations at Deloitte and Cisco, Ashley Goodall reveals the truth about human performance and offers a radical new alternative to the constant turbulence that defines corporate life.  The Problem with Change  is a clarion call to leaders everywhere: by prioritizing team cohesion (instead of reshuffling teams at will), using real words (rather than corporate-speak), by sharing secrets (not mission statements), by honoring shared rituals (rather than mandated bonding), by fixing only the things that are truly broken (instead of moving fast and breaking everything in sight), and more, leaders at every level can create the stability that people need to thrive.

                "The grounded, clear-sighted guide you need to blend digital and traditional business functions for long-term competitive advantage.   Business leaders are continually told they need to embrace digital disruption wholeheartedly to thrive in the 21st century. Legacy companies, we hear, are all doomed to fail unless they double down on the latest digital innovations, and disruptors are ordained to take over the world. Digital innovation is the answer to everything.  False! Nothing in life or business is ever that simple.  In  The Brains and Brawn Company: How Leading Organizations Blend the Best of Digital and Physical , venture capitalist and Stanford Business School lecturer Robert Siegel brings the digital innovation conversation back down to earth. He shows that, while important, digital is only part of the answer, and it's never the only answer. The vast majority of successful leaders from both incumbents and disruptors focus as much on things like logistics, manufacturing, and distribution as they do on digital innovation. In fact, many established companies are successfully countering young upstarts in other creative ways, and many new organizations are learning from their older brethren.  Filled with original research and case studies of Daimler, 23andMe, Instacart, AB InBev, Google, and many other companies,  The Brains and Brawn Company: How Leading Organizations Blend the Best of Digital and Physical  provides practical, proven insights and advice for bridging the gulf between digital vs. physical, disruptor vs. incumbent, start-up world vs. Fortune 500, and tech culture vs. industrial culture.   The Brains and Brawn Company: How Leading Organizations Blend the Best of Digital and Physical  provides everything you need to set your company apart from your competitors in real and measurable ways - and take the lead in your industry for years to come.

                "Part memoir, part searing revelation, Seen Yet Unseen takes readers behind the scenes of some of the world's biggest tech companies and exposes the way their exclusion of and, at times, hostility toward Black women have lasting impacts on the technology we use every day.  Over the years the products of big tech companies and Silicon Valley have become indispensable to our lives. They impact the way we socialize, make purchases, and even our medical decisions. But what happens when a major segment of the population\u2014in this case Black women\u2014isn't included in these companies?  For over a decade, B\u00e4r\u00ed A. Williams has worked to carve a space for herself as a Black woman in the incredibly white male sphere of major tech companies, eventually becoming a lead counsel at Facebook and architect of their supplier diversity program. However, she also experienced the peculiar feeling familiar to Black women in the workforce: being both unseen and too seen. In raw and personal stories, Williams recounts balancing on glass cliffs while battling the burnout that so often forces Black women out of these companies, and how the industry's lack\u2014and loss\u2014of Black women not only harms the businesses themselves but has troubling ramifications for their products, particularly as the promises of AI and the Metaverse loom large.  In a tone both forthright and revealing, Williams dissects how a culture that has largely excluded Black women\u2014and people of color more generally\u2014is at a tipping point and that only through embracing and listening to Black women can we prevent the further weaponization of these technologies against marginalized communities. From fledgling in-house diversity initiatives to gentrification and the rise of AI, Seen Yet Unseen takes the reader inside the obscured machinations of big tech companies and makes a case for why diversity is essential to the future of technology.

                "American households are awash in expensive credit card debt. But where did all this debt come from? In this history of the rise of postwar American finance, Sean H. Vanatta shows how bankers created our credit card economy and, with it, the indebted nation we know today. America's consumer debt machine was not inevitable. In the years after World War II, state and federal regulations ensured that many Americans enjoyed safe banks and inexpensive credit. Bankers, though, grew restless amid restrictive rules that made profits scarce. They experimented with new services and new technologies. They settled on credit cards, and in the 1960s mailed out reams of high-interest plastic to build a debt industry from scratch. In the 1960s and 70s consumers fought back, using federal and state policy to make credit cards safer and more affordable. But bankers found ways to work around local rules. Beginning in 1980, Citibank and its peers relocated their card plans to South Dakota and Delaware, states with the weakest consumer regulations, creating \"on-shore\" financial havens and drawing consumers into an exploitative credit economy over which they had little control. We live in the world these bankers made. "

                "NATIONAL BESTSELLER  Bestselling economist Jeff Rubin warns that the shock inflation of 2021 is the front of a perfect storm of war, supply-chain disruption, geopolitical realignment, domestic upheaval, and energy scarcity that will change everything.  During the pandemic, government deficits skyrocketed to record highs while central banks primed the printing presses\u2014and the time has come to pay for it. The ramifications of international COVID-19 spending could potentially last for decades, and inevitably one of the first consequences will be that central banks will lose control of interest rates, and subsequently, growth and inflation targets. The genie will be out of the bottle. That is just the first symptom of a series of cascading upheavals. Supply-chain disruptions have already shown the vulnerability of the globalist model that has fueled growth for the past decades. War has not only shown the fragility of the status quo, but has revealed diplomatic and economic rifts that promise to shift trading patterns. At the same time, the precarity of the US dollar underlines the life-or-death importance of foreign markets and resources, energy in particular. And consolidation of a Eurasian bloc, from Russia to China, and encompassing old enemies like Iran and former US ally Saudi Arabia, hint that the upheaval of COVID-19 was just the beginning. Tracking trade wars and kinetic wars, central banks and runs on banks, pipelines blown up and startups knocked down,  A Map of the New Normal  gives us a glimpse of a near future that will look very different from the recent past. It reminds us that our mortgage rates and job security, our grocery bills and investments, are all tied to events set in motion by governments, corporations, and black swans around the world. "

Ask leads to smarter decisions, more creative solutions, and deeper relationships.       Too often, we don't find out what's truly on others' hearts and minds because we don't know how to ask the right questions in the right ways. Co-founder of Transcend and former international business consultant and Teach for America executive Jeff Wetzler wants to show you how to fix that. In Ask, he brings you a powerful method called The Ask Approach\u2122, based on a simple premise: that tapping into what other people truly think, know, and feel is a game-changing superpower.     In Section I, Wetzler reveals the most common things that people think and feel but often keep to themselves, as well as the key reasons why they choose to withhold information that could be valuable to you and your organization.    Section II delves into the five steps of the Ask Approach, each answering an essential question:     Choose Curiosity: How can you awaken your curiosity to make new discoveries and unexpected connections?      Make it Safe: How do you make it easier for people to tell you hard things?      Pose Quality Questions: What questions will best tap into the wisdom of anyone you ask?      Listen to Learn: How can you hear what someone is really trying to tell you?      Reflect & Reconnect: How do you turn talk into action?     Section III helps you make asking an everyday superpower \u2013 not only for yourself but also for your team and organization, as well as for the next generation and society at large.    The skills and messages of Ask could not be more timely. In a fast-changing world where AI is supplanting an increasing range of skills, the ability to learn from and connect with other people is one of the most important, fulfilling and uniquely human capabilities to master.

                "From one of the world's top experts on the economics of skyscrapers\u2014a fascinating account of the ever-growing quest for super tall buildings across the globe.   The world's skyscrapers have brought us awe and wonder, and yet they remain controversial\u2014for their high costs, shadows, and overt grandiosity. But, decade by decade, they keep getting higher and higher. What is driving this global building spree of epic proportions? In  Cities in the Sky , author Jason Barr explains all: why they appeal to cities and nations, how they get financed, why they succeed economically, and how they change a city's skyline and enable the world's greatest metropolises to thrive in the 21st century.   From the Empire State Building (1,250 feet) to the Shanghai Tower (2,073 feet) and everywhere in between, Barr explains the unique architectural and engineering efforts that led to the creation of each. Along the way, Barr visits and unpacks some surprising myths about the earliest skyscrapers and the growth of American skylines after World War II, which incorporated a new suite of technologies that spread to the rest of the world in the 1990s. Barr also explores why London banned skyscrapers at the end of the 19th century but then embraced them in the 21st and explains how Hong Kong created the densest cluster of skyscrapers on the planet. Also covered is the dramatic result of China's \"skyscraper fever\" and then on to the Arabian Peninsula to see what drove Dubai to build the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, which at 2,717 feet, is higher than the new One World Trade Center in New York by three football fields.   Filled with fascinating details for urbanists, architecture buffs, and urban design enthusiasts alike,  Cities in the Sky  addresses the good, bad, and ugly for cities that have embraced vertical skylines and offers us a glimpse to the future to see whether cities around the world will continue their journey ever upwards.

                "A stirring, comprehensive look at the state of women in the workforce\u2014why women's progress has stalled, how our economy fosters unproductive competition, and how we can fix the system that holds women back.   In an era of supposed great equality, women are still falling behind in the workplace. Even with more women in the workforce than in decades past, wage gaps continue to increase. It is the most educated women who have fallen the furthest behind. Blue-collar women hold the most insecure and badly paid jobs in our economy. And even as we celebrate high-profile representation\u2014women on the board of Fortune 500 companies and our first female vice president\u2014women have limited recourse when they experience harassment and discrimination.     Fair Shake: Women and the Fight to Build a Just Economy  explains that the system that governs our economy\u2014a winner-take-all economy\u2014is the root cause of these myriad problems. The WTA economy self-selects for aggressive, cutthroat business tactics, which creates a feedback loop that sidelines women. The authors, three legal scholars, call this feedback loop \"the triple bind\": if women  don't  compete on the same terms as men, they lose; if women  do  compete on the same terms as men, they're punished more harshly for their sharp elbows or actual misdeeds; and when women see that they can't win on the same terms as men, they take themselves out of the game (if they haven't been pushed out already). With odds like these stacked against them, it's no wonder women feel like, no matter how hard they work, they can't get ahead.    Fair Shake  is not a \"fix the woman\" book; it's a \"fix the system\" book. It not only diagnoses the problem of what's wrong with the modern economy, but shows how, with awareness and collective action, we can build a truly just economy for all. "

                "Barbie is a strong, independent doll. But is she a feminist icon? It's complicated. Since her introduction in 1959, Barbie's impact has been revolutionary. Far from being a toy designed by men to oppress women, she was a toy invented by women to teach women what was expected of them, for better or for worse. Whether tarred-and-glittered as antifeminist puffery or celebrated as a feminist icon (or, at any rate, an important cultural touchstone in understanding feminism), Barbie has undeniably influenced generations of girls. In Forever Barbie, cultural critic, investigative journalist, and first-generation Barbie owner M. G. Lord uncovers the surprising story behind Barbie's smash success. Revealing her low origins as \"Bild Lilli,\" a risqu\u00e9 doll for adults sold as a gag gift in postwar Germany, Forever Barbie traces Barbie's development and transformation, through countless makeovers and career changes, into an international pop culture icon and now \"traditional toy.\" Though not every doll in the line has been a hit\u2014with pregnant Midge and Growing up Skipper among the more intriguing disasters\u2014Barbie's endurance, Lord writes, speaks as much to Mattel's successful marketing as it does to our society's overall ambivalence toward femininity. With new accessories, including a preface on the latest developments in the Barbieverse, Forever Barbie \"will make you think of America's most celebrated plastic doll in ways you never have before\" (Susan Faludi).

                "The world\u2014famous former con artist and bestselling author of  Catch Me if You Can    now reveals the mind\u2014boggling tricks of the scam trade\u2014with advice that has made him one of America's most sought\u2014after fraud\u2014prevention experts. \"I had as much knowledge as any man alive concerning the mechanics of forgery, check swindling, counterfeiting, and other similar crimes. Ever since I'd been released from prison, I'd often felt that if I directed this knowledge into the right channels, I could help people a great deal. Every time I went to the store and wrote a check, I would see two or three mistakes made on the part of the clerk or cashier, mistakes that a flimflam artist would take advantage of. . . . In a certain sense, I'm still a con artist. I'm just putting down a positive con these days, as opposed to the negative con I used in the past. I've merely redirected the talents I've always possessed. I've applied the same relentless attention to working on stopping fraud that I once applied to perpetuating fraud.\" In  Catch Me if You Can  ,  Frank W. Abagnale recounted his youthful career as a master imposter and forger. In  The Art of the Steal , Abagnale tells the remarkable story of how he parlayed his knowledge of cons and scams into a successful career as a consultant on preventing financial foul play\u2014while showing you how to identify and outsmart perpetrators of fraud. Technology may have made it easier to track down criminals, but cyberspace has spawned a skyrocketing number of ways to commit crime\u2014much of it untraceable. Businesses are estimated to lose an unprecedented $400 billion a year from fraud of one sort or another. If we were able to do away with fraud for just two years, we'd erase the national debt and pay Social Security for the next one hundred years. However, Abagnale has discovered that punishment for committing fraud, much less recovery of stolen funds, seldom happens: Once you're a victim, you won't get your money back. Prevention is the best form of protection.  Drawn from his twenty-five years of experience as an ingenious con artist (whose check scams alone mounted to more than $2 million in stolen funds), Abagnale's  The Art of the Steal    provides eye-opening stories of true scams, with tips on how they can be prevented. Abagnale takes you deep inside the world and mind of the con artist, showing you just how he pulled off his scams and what you can do to avoid becoming the next victim. You'll hear the stories of notorious swindles, like the mustard squirter trick and the \"rock in the box\" ploy, and meet the criminals like the famous Vickers Gang who perpetrated them. You'll find out why crooks wash checks and iron credit cards and why a thief brings glue with him to the ATM. And finally, you'll learn how to recognize a bogus check or a counterfeit bill, and why you shouldn't write your grocery list on a deposit slip. A revealing look inside the predatory criminal mind from a former master of the con,  The Art of the Steal  is the ultimate defense against even the craftiest crook. "

                "A psychiatrist puts leadership \"on the couch,\" with a provocative exploration of its crucial, often ignored, psychological and personal character foundations.     Elias Aboujaoude's distinctive exploration of leadership provides unusual insight into understanding who should and should not be striving for leadership positions.    Dr Aboujaoude takes on the culture at large, explaining how our cult-like obsession with leadership gives narcissists an edge and results in leadership failure everywhere we look\u2014and how resisting the imperative to rise at all costs can leave many with an inferiority complex.     His takedown of the \"leadership industrial complex,\" an unholy alliance of gurus, coaches, business school professors, and TED-talkers, from Harvard on down, pokes a very sharp elbow into an industry seemingly united in a modern form of alchemy to create leadership gold\u2014a waste of time, money, and effort, since leadership cannot be taught through books or coaching and cannot be bought.    Rather, Dr Aboujaoude vividly illustrates, leaders emerge from a unique combination of personal, psychological, and situational factors that may not be easily controlled. To a large degree, great leaders are born, or happen, with the help of innate temperament, talent, opportunity, circumstances, and timing.     Frank and unflinching, this refreshing take on a classic subject, with its focus on the art of knowing yourself, provides new insight into whether your psychology is aligned with the requirements of effective and happy leadership. The effect is to empower readers to understand themselves and step up if they have what it takes to lead\u2014or find equally rewarding, often superior, ways to achieve fulfillment and leave their mark if they don't.

FTX went bankrupt, and SBF was arrested, extradited from the Bahamas to the United States, and charged with multiple counts of fraud and other criminal offenses.

What does it mean when shareability supersedes innovation? How can we make a choice when the options have been so carefully arranged for us?  From coffee shops to city grids to TikTok feeds and Netflix homepages the world over, algorithmic recommendations prescribe our experiences. This network of mathematically determined choices - the 'Filterworld' - has taken over, almost unnoticed, as we've grown accustomed to an insipid new normal. But to have our tastes, behaviours, and emotions governed by computers calls the very notion of free will into question.   Internationally recognized journalist and  New Yorker  staff writer Kyle Chayka journeys through this ever-tightening web woven by algorithms. He explores how online and offline spaces alike have been engineered for seamless consumption. How the lowest common denominator is promoted at the expense of the complex, diverse or challenging. How users of technology contend with data-driven equations that promise to anticipate their desires but often get them wrong. How the FIlterworld is determining the very shape of culture itself.  Chayka skilfully and compellingly traces this creeping, machine-guided curation that influences not just what culture we consume, but what culture is produced. In doing so, he attempts to answer to the most urgent question currently facing us: is personal freedom ever again possible on the Internet?  Filterworld  is a fascinating history of the rise of the algorithm and an important investigation into where it could take us next - if we let it. "

In a world of hustle culture and burnout, women don't want to lean in, they want to lie down. Now more than ever, women are looking to leave the corporate grind to break out into their own entrepreneurial ventures in a way that feeds their life rather than consumes it. But they don't know exactly where to start. Kathleen Griffith has been in these exact shoes.

She realized, shockingly, that all the \"mindset\" work paid the highest dividends of all in her business, and that through this process she had developed a proven method for success. Blending foundational  mindset  tenets with the practical, actionable, business-building  skillsets ,  Build Like A Woman  is for aspiring and existing entrepreneurs who want to start and scale a business AND life they love. From corporate dropouts to side hustlers to recent college grads to full-fledged founders. This is not a regular business book, but an unconventional blueprint for creation.

                "This program features an introduction, afterword, and acknowledgements read by the author.  The go-to book on immigration: fact-based, comprehensive, and nonpartisan.   Immigration is one of the most controversial topics in the United States and everywhere else. Pundits, politicians, and the public usually depict immigrants as either villains or victims. The villain narrative is that immigrants pose a threat\u2014to our economy because they steal our jobs; our way of life because they change our culture; and to our safety and laws because of their criminality. The victim argument tells us that immigrants are needy outsiders\u2014the poor, huddled masses whom we must help at our own cost if necessary. But the data clearly debunks both narratives. From jobs, investment, and innovation to cultural vitality and national security, more immigration has an overwhelmingly positive impact on everything that makes a society successful. In  The Truth About Immigration , Wharton professor Zeke Hernandez draws from nearly 20 years of research to answer all the big questions about immigration. He combines moving personal stories with rigorous research to offer an accessible, apolitical, and evidence-based look at how newcomers affect our local communities and our nation. You'll learn about the overlooked impact of immigrants on investment and job creation; realize how much we take for granted the novel technologies, products, and businesses newcomers create; get the facts straight about perennial concerns like jobs, crime, and undocumented immigrants; and gain new perspectives on misunderstood issues such as the border, taxes, and assimilation. Most books making a case for immigration tell you that immigration is good for immigrants. This book is all about how newcomers benefit you, your community, and your country. Skeptics fear that newcomers compete economically with locals because of their similarities and fail to socially assimilate because of their differences. You'll see that it's exactly the opposite: newcomers bring enduring economic benefits because of their differences and contribute positively to society because of their similarities. Destined to become the go-to book on one of the most important issues of our time, this book turns fear into hope by proving a simple truth: immigrants are essential for economically prosperous and socially vibrant nations.

                "How do you maximize your success and impact as a leader while maintaining your stamina and sanity? The answer doesn't lie in simple \"efficiency.\" It's not about making better use of your time and resources. It's about understanding how energy works and how to tap into its power.   Many people live lives of intense, and false, emotional compartmentalization. For example, they strive to be one person in the corner office (invincible warrior) and another person at the dinner table (sensitive spouse), and they struggle to keep those two lives from bleeding into and contradicting each other. But as it turns out, this takes a tremendous amount of energy and is almost always impossible. One person can't be two different people.  So how do you live an integrated life of fulfillment, purpose, and success? How do you create an alignment between head, heart, and the creative power that is in coherence with your true self? The answer is both simple and complex: You need to move from managing your time to mastering your energy.  For more than a decade and a half, Ricardo Sunderland has worked with the leaders of some of the largest and most recognizable companies in the world. He has learned firsthand that for today's leaders\u2014at all levels in their organizations\u2014mental and physical energy are no longer all you need for success. Today's leaders must bring emotional and spiritual energy to their roles and create a space in which both they and their team members feel safe to challenge each other, grow together, and thrive.  Given this major leadership challenge, leaders must gain the energy advantage.  You will learn:  What gives you energy.  How to identify the energy blockers that are holding you back.  That every situation presents a choice for you to unlock the transformational source of energy within you.  The path to gaining the energy advantage on seven distinct levels. "

                "Bob DeKoch and Phil Clampitt draw on their years of innovative practice and research to describe how leading with care enriches people and transforms organizations in our challenging times. Gallup recently reported that only 15% of employees in the United States are truly engaged in their workplace. Yet nearly 70% of employees say they would work harder if they felt more appreciated. Over 90% of employees surveyed believed their leadership \"lacked communication skills to lead.\" Leaders can do better. That's why the authors sought to go beyond the laudable sentiments of the \"servant leadership\" movement by envisioning, creating, and testing a new leadership platform based on a set of guiding beliefs and actual day-to-day practices. In this book, the authors share how caring leaders adroitly blend visible and subtle practices to realize the aspirational benefits of coaching and collaboration. The authors also provide insights about less frequently discussed leadership issues such as how to build an empowering network of relationships and transform pushback into progress. Anyone who wishes to craft their own distinctive, compelling, and empowering leadership style that unleashes the latent energy of people and their organizations will discover a robust and enriching framework for doing so in Leading with Care in a Tough World.

Corporations enabled everything from the construction of ancient Rome's roads and aqueducts to the artistic flourishing of the Renaissance to the rise of the middle class in the twentieth century. By recapturing this original spirit of civic virtue, Magnuson argues, corporations can help craft a society in which all of us\u2014not just shareholders\u2014benefit from the profits of enterprise.

                "\"Would you recommend this company to your friends and colleagues?\" That's the ultimate question. Fred Reichheld's book of the same name created quite a stir in 2006. Reichheld is co-founder along with Owen and Brooks of the methodology behind answering the question. The original book challenged the conventional wisdom of customer satisfaction surveys and coined the terms \"bad profits\" and \"good profits.\" It pointed to a faster, much more accurate way of gauging customers real feelings about a company, and a quantitative measure (Net Promoter Score) for establishing a baseline and effectively tracking changes going forward. This book tells how based on a multitude of real cases to actually install and embed Net Promoter discipline in organizations of all stripes. As such, it is a natural follow-on to The Ultimate Question, and will appeal to those with strategic and tactical business responsibilities. Brooks has a treasure trove of examples and case-study findings from the more than 80 companies she has helped put CEM and Net Promoter disciplines in place. Several of these will be explored in the book, and the book's proscriptions are all informed by results extracted from those cases. "

They are able to talk about difficult topics without giving offence. They know how to make others feel at ease and share what they think. They're brilliant facilitators and decision-guiders. How do they do it? In this groundbreaking new book, Charles Duhigg unravels the secrets of the supercommunicators to reveal the art - and the science - of successful communication. He unpicks the different types of everyday conversation and pinpoints why some go smoothly while others swiftly fall apart. He reveals the conversational questions and gambits that bring people together. And he shows how even the most tricky of encounters can be turned around. In the process, he shows why a CIA operative was able to win over a reluctant spy, how a member of a jury got his fellow jurors to view an open-and-shut case differently, and what a doctor found they needed to do to engage with a vaccine sceptic. Above all, he reveals the techniques we can all master to successfully connect with others, however tricky the circumstances. Packed with fascinating case studies and drawing on cutting-edge research, this book will change the way you think about what you say, and how you say it.

                "\"One thing I've learned being around Gary for the last decade is that when he sees new consumer trends or new best practices in marketing, people should listen and act on them.\"  \u2014 Michael Rubin, CEO of Fanatics    In his seventh business book, bestselling author, entrepreneur, and investor Gary Vaynerchuk offers fresh, in-depth advice to enhance brand development, grow sales, and beat the competition using modern advertising strategies grounded in social media.   In his 2013 bestseller Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, Gary Vaynerchuk showed the world how to create winning content for underpriced attention channels. But since then, new platforms have emerged, others have become less relevant, and algorithms are incentivizing new styles of content. New skills are necessary to create advertising that builds brand and sales.  In his latest book, Vaynerchuk argues that today's fast-growing businesses, brands, content creators, and influencers have one thing in common: They mastered storytelling in areas of underpriced attention, which predominantly exists across a handful of social media platforms. Informed by 20+ years of business and marketing success, he contends that the biggest transformation and opportunity is the \"TikTokification of Social Media.\" Increasingly, platforms are distributing content based on what users are interested in, rather than who they follow.  Small businesses, large corporations, and creators can take advantage of this trend to develop brand and grow sales by producing relevant, strategic content, even if they don't have an audience. But how does one make relevant content? What should advertisements look like, in this new world?  In this book, Vaynerchuk provides detailed answers to these questions and more, revealing the tactics to master modern advertising with strategies you can apply to the moment you're currently living in.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Powerful Phrases for Dealing with Workplace Conflict is an essential resource for all employees (and their managers) who are looking for help on how to navigate frequent workplace conflicts, including with their boss and other difficult people, so they can rebuild trust, collaboration, and ultimately enjoy more influence at work.

                "Edmund Phelps is among the most important economists of his generation. He developed a new understanding of unemployment and inflation and went on to rethink the roots of innovation. In this book, Phelps tells the story of his role in reshaping economic theory, offering a powerful personal account of a creative and rewarding career. My Journeys in Economic Theory charts two major phases of Phelps's work, illuminating the breadth of his contributions to the field. First, introducing the expectations of wage setters and cofounding the \"equilibrium\" rate of unemployment, he built the microeconomic foundations for the employment theory pioneered by Keynes and Hicks. More recently, he conceived a theory of \"mass flourishing\" in which individuals' creativity and society's dynamism fuel grassroots innovation and generate job satisfaction in the process. Phelps recounts his vivid experiences in the world of economics as well as his relationships with luminaries such as John Rawls, Thomas Nagel, Paul Samuelson, and Paul Volcker. At its core, this book shares the joy of intellectual achievement: the excitement of coming up with a new idea that radically departs from prevailing views and the satisfaction of exercising one's own ingenuity instead of applying or developing others' models.

Bankers brought the global economic system to its knees in 2007 and nearly did the same in 2020. Both times, the US government bailed out the banks and left them in control. How can we end this cycle of trillion-dollar bailouts and make finance work for the rest of us? Busting the Bankers' Club confronts the powerful people and institutions that benefit from our broken financial system-and the struggle to create an alternative. Drawing from decades of research on the history, economics, and politics of banking, economist Gerald Epstein shows that any meaningful reform will require breaking up this club of politicians, economists, lawyers, and CEOs who sustain the status quo. Thankfully, there are thousands of activists, experts, and public officials who are working to do just that. Clear-eyed and hopeful, Busting the Bankers' Club centers the individuals and groups fighting for a financial system that will better serve the needs of the marginalized and support important transitions to a greener, fairer economy.

Most startups fail not because of a bad product, poor timing, or mismanaged cash, but because of people problems: conflicts over strategy, decision-making, and team culture. Even the smartest entrepreneurs have been derailed by these soft problems: How do you fire a loyal friend who's not up to par? How do you motivate your team to give their all? What happens when egos and emotions overpower facts and reason? The soft stuff can be shockingly hard.  Martin Gonzalez and Josh Yellin outline the common traps startup teams fall into, and share their powerful one-day workshop that helps teams escape those traps. The unique process of The Bonfire Moment brings colleagues together for a full day of facing hard truths, noticing hidden dynamics, and gearing up for the intense challenges of startup life. When the constant hustle feels overwhelming, a team's Bonfire Moment pulls them out of the day-to-day intensity to reflect and reboot.  The Bonfire Moment has proven effective with hundreds of teams of all sizes around the world\u2014from the smallest startups to large organizations\u2014significantly improving their cohesion, focus and effectiveness. Now this book will teach leaders the principles behind The Bonfire Moment and how to run the workshop on their own. It's ideal for anyone who needs to build an extraordinary team to achieve big goals.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Most business books provide a one-size-fits-all approach to career advice that overlooks the unique barriers that women of color face. In  The Memo , Minda Harts offers a much-needed career guide tailored specifically for women of color. Drawing on knowledge gained from her past career as a fundraising consultant to top colleges across the country, Harts now brings her powerhouse entrepreneurial experience as CEO of The Memo to the page. With wit and candor, she acknowledges \"ugly truths\" that keep women of color from having a seat at the table in corporate America. Providing straight talk on how to navigate networking, office politics, and money, while showing how to make real change to the system,  The Memo  offers support and long-overdue advice on how women of color can succeed in their careers.
