                "In this book perfect for emergent readers, Cat wants a fish. He ventures out in search of one and comes across a horn in the window of a music shop that he thinks his neighbor Elephant might like, so Cat buys it. Cat's search for a fish continues when he encounters a bookstore. Certainly bookworm Dog would enjoy a new book so Cat buys him one. Cat's sweep of generosity continues as he buys a paintbrush for Bird at an art store and a plant for Rabbit from the florist. In his surge of excitement to give his friends their new gifts, Cat almost forgets to get himself a fish! When Cat returns home and presents his friends with their new things, they are all very happy, which for Cat is the greatest happiness of all. An I Like to Read\u00ae book. Guided Reading Level C. "
