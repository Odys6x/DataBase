                "Tender Paws takes a deep dive into the practical benefits of applying therapeutic parenting best practices to dogs in our care.When Wendy Lyons Sunshine got her first puppy\u2014abandoned behind a gas station, struggling with worms and anemia\u2014she was in over her head. As puppy training guides failed to help her with the out-of-control, traumatized bundle of teeth and claws rescue pup, she turned to her work helping world-class child development experts. Could strategies for raising happy, well-adjusted kids transfer to a puppy?As it turns out, yes, they can! From the first try, parenting wisdom transformed Sunshine's relationship with her challenging little one. Soon enough, Sunshine's view of her puppy shifted from one of adversity to one of compassion and understanding, and she was able to bring patience and therapeutic concepts to meet her dog's needs. When Sunshine reached out to experts, they affirmed that science-based principles used with at-risk children align well with best practices of holistic, positive, and progressive dog handling. Exploring parallels between human and canine research, attachment styles, history of trauma, parenting styles, and her own \"inner child\" proved a mindful path for pet parenting.Far from a standard dog training manual, Tender Paws explicitly applies parenting wisdom and best practices used with special needs kids to a cross-section of scenarios, from recognizing developmental trauma and unmet core needs, to making decisions about appropriate equipment, to responding to difficult behavior, to understanding the parenting style from which we approach our dogs.Sunshine empowers you and your dog by offering:  A synthesis of the fields of child development, attachment, trauma, sensory integration, neurobiology, learning, animal behavior, and ethology.  A problem-solving framework that makes dog training decisions clearer and behavior frustrations easier to resolve.  Parenting wisdom to help your dog move beyond trauma and into wellness.Borrowing the principles of parenting for dogs feels obvious to some people: instinctive and ordinary and inevitable. But that's not true for everyone, especially those of us who had a less than ideal childhood and bear the scars of early harm, loss, trauma, or deprivation. Tender Paws provides an interdisciplinary, comprehensive, evidence-based guide for readers who want to honor the needs of\u2014and improve outcomes for\u2014puppies and dogs they care about. "

Let it.\" \u2014 Kirkus Reviews       From Pulitzer Prize finalist Tommy Tomlinson comes an inside account of the Westminster Dog Show that follows one dog on his quest to become a champion\u2014and explores the bond between dogs and their people.  Tommy Tomlinson was watching a dog show on television a few years ago when he had a sudden thought: Are those dogs happy? How about pet dogs\u2014are they happy? Those questions sparked a quest to venture inside the dog-show world, in search of a deeper understanding of the relationship between dogs and humans that has endured for thousands of years.  Dogland  shares his surprising, entertaining, and moving adventures.   Tomlinson spends three years on the road and goes behind the scenes at more than one hundred competitions across the country, from Midwestern fairgrounds to Madison Square Garden. Along the way he is licked, sniffed, and rubbed up against by dogs of nearly every size, shape, and breed. Like a real-life version of the classic mockumentary  Best in Show ,  Dogland  follows one champion show dog\u2014a Samoyed named Striker\u2014as well as his handler, Laura King, and his devoted entourage of breeders and owners as he competes in the 2022 Westminster Dog Show.   Striker's whole career has been leading up to this moment. As Tomlinson writes, picking a top show dog is like drafting an NFL quarterback when they're still in elementary school. Now Striker has made it to the Super Bowl. Tomlinson takes readers on the long road to glory, bringing the dog-show circuit to life as he witnesses teams scrambling from town to town in search of championship points and large, colorful ribbons. (Striker and his crew travel in a custom-built RV named after Betty White.)   Tomlinson's limitless curiosity about people and dogs reaches far beyond the show tents and into the ordinary lives of dogs. We hear from experts who have discovered new insights into how dogs and humans formed their bond\u2014and how that bond has changed over the centuries. We discover the fascinating origins of different dog breeds, learn about the elaborate breed standards that determine an ideal show dog, and consider the health issues that can arise in purebred dogs. We also meet dog lovers who applaud every dog, regardless of breed, simply for being themselves, such as WeRateDogs, the social media phenomenon with millions of followers, all for posts celebrating the day-to-day goofiness in most dog owners' lives.   Engaging, charming, and insightful,  Dogland  is an irresistibly appealing read that invites us on a rollicking backstage tour through the rituals, tricks, and wonders of the dog-show world\u2014and reveals what matters most for the happiness of dogs and dog lovers everywhere.

Caleb Carr has had special relationships with cats since he was a young boy in a turbulent household, famously peopled by the founding members of the Beat Generation, where his steadiest companions were the adopted cats that lived with him both in the city and the country. As an adult, he has had many close feline companions, with relationships that have outlasted most of his human ones. But only after building a three-story home in rural, upstate New York did he enter into the most extraordinary of all of his cat pairings: Masha, a Siberian Forest cat who had been abandoned as a kitten, and was languishing in a shelter when Caleb met her. She had hissed and fought off all previous carers and potential adopters, but somehow, she chose Caleb as her savior.    For the seventeen years that followed, Caleb and Masha were inseparable. Masha ruled the house and the extensive, dangerous surrounding fields and forests. When she was hurt, only Caleb could help her. When he suffered long-standing physical ailments, Masha knew what to do. Caleb's life-long study of the literature of cat behavior, and his years of experience with previous cats, helped him decode much of Masha's inner life. But their bond went far beyond academic studies and experience. The story of Caleb and Masha is an inspiring and life-affirming relationship for readers of all backgrounds and interests\u2014a love story like no other. "

                "A wildlife expert explores what science tells us about animals as unique individuals and why animal personality matters for the human-animal bond and for adaptation in nature.  Why are some cats cuddly and others standoffish? Why are some dogs adventuresome, others homebodies? As any pet owner can attest, we feel that the animals we\u2019ve formed bonds with are unique, as particular (and peculiar) as any human friend or loved one. Recent years have brought an increased understanding of animal intelligence and emotion. But is there a scientific basis for animal personality and individuality, or is this notion purely sentimental? It turns out that science has been reluctant to even broach the subject of individuality until recently. But now, a fundamental shift in scientific understanding is underway, as mainstream scientists begin to accept the idea that animals of all kinds\u2014from beloved beasts like apes and birds to decidedly less cuddly creatures like crabs and spiders\u2014do indeed have individual personalities. In  Mousy Cats and Sheepish Coyotes , veteran wildlife expert Dr. John A. Shivik brings us stories from the front lines of this exciting new discipline. Drawing on his scientific training, as well as his storytelling gifts, Shivik serves as an accessible, humorous guide to the emerging body of research on animal personalities. Shivik accompanies researchers who are discovering that each wolf, bear, and coyote has an inherent tendency to favor either its aggressive nature or to shyly avoid conflicts. Some bluebirds are lovers, others are fighters. And some spiders prefer to be loners, while others are sociable. Unique personalities can be discovered in every corner of the animal kingdom\u2014even among microscopic organisms. The array of personality types among all species is only beginning to be described and understood. As Shivik argues, animals\u2019 unique personalities are important not only because they determine which animals we bond with. Individual animal traits are also fundamental but still inadequately understood drivers of evolution, adaptation, and species diversity. Ultimately,  Mousy Cats and Sheepish Coyotes  offers insight into the similarities humans share with animals and presents evidence of an unbroken biological connection from the smallest organisms to Homo sapiens.

                "Who's a Good Dog? is an invitation to nurture more thoughtful and balanced relationships with our canine companions. By deepening our curiosity about what our dogs are experiencing, and by working together with them, we can become more effective and compassionate caregivers. With sympathy for the challenges met by both dogs and their humans, bioethicist Jessica Pierce explores common practices of caring for dogs, including how we provide exercise, what we feed, how and why we socialize and train, and how we employ tools such as collars and leashes. She helps us both to identify potential sources of fear and anxiety in our dogs' lives and to expand practices that provide physical and emotional nourishment. Who's a Good Dog? also encourages us to think more critically about what we expect of our dogs and how these expectations can set everyone up for success or failure. Pierce offers resources to help us cultivate attentiveness and kindness, inspiring us to practice the art of noticing, of astonishment, of looking with fresh eyes at these beings we think we know so well. And more than this, she makes her findings relatable by examining facets of her relationship with Bella, the dog in her life. As Bella shows throughout, all dogs are good dogs, and we, as humans and dog guardians, could be doing a little bit better to get along with them. "

How can dogs detect cancer with up to a 98 percent accuracy rate, and foresee epileptic or diabetic seizures in their owners? How do animals seem to know an earthquake is coming long before the world's best seismologists?  In  Animal Wisdom,  veterinarian and animal advocate Linda Bender offers a wealth of amazing stories and research-based evidence indicating animals have deeply perceptive\u2014even extrasensory\u2014abilities.

More than 90 percent of dog owners consider their pets to be members of their family. But often, despite our best intentions, we are letting our dogs down by not giving them the guidance and direction they need. Unwanted behavior is the number-one reason dogs are relinquished to shelters and rescue groups.    The key to training dogs effectively is first to understand why our dogs do what they do. And no one can address this more authoritatively than the diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists, whose expert and researched work analyze problem behaviors and correct common misconceptions.    With veterinary-approved positive training methods, expert advice on socialization, and remedies for behavior problems such as OCD and aggression, Decoding Your Dog is the must-have behavior guide that will challenge the way we think about man's best friend.

                "A powerful collection of quotations by writers, leaders, and legends on the pain of losing a pet and overcoming grief.  An animal's love is deep, uncomplicated, unconditional, and forgiving. \"Affection without ambivalence\" is how Sigmund Freud described the connection. \"No matter how awful the day, or how awful I am behaving at any given moment, George doesn't care,\" writes journalist John Dickerson. \"He finds me smoldering in my chair and dashes to my lap.\" Our lives are intricately intertwined with our pets, and together, over time, we establish rituals that are as steady as a metronome. It's no wonder the grief is crushing when they depart\u2014even those who've had time to prepare describe feeling stunned, devastated, and cracked in two.   \"We were a bit broken up over the death of our black Persian cat,\" crime novelist Raymond Chandler confessed. \"When I say a bit broken up, I am being conventional. For us it was a tragedy.\" Nobel Prize\u2013winning author V. S. Naipaul described the experience as \"calamitous,\" and writer May Sarton called it a \"volcanic eruption of woe.\" Poet Emily Dickinson was so bereft she asked for help: \"Carlo died,\" she announced in a letter to her friend Thomas Wentworth Higginson in 1866. \"Would you instruct me now?\"    The Book of Pet Love and Loss  is a collection of quotations\u2014poignant thoughts and memories discovered in letters, journals, diaries, memoirs, and other original sources\u2014from beloved cultural figures who understood this singular experience so deeply, they felt compelled to write about it. This book dignifies the profound connection we share with our animal companions, but it also provides solace as mourners document their heartache over the loss of their cats, dogs, rabbits, birds, and other animals\u2014even, in the case of Pablo Neruda, a mongoose. Their comforting and wise words are what every animal lover needs on this journey of heartbreak and healing. "

Montaigne There is no real evidence that humans ever 'domesticated' cats. Rather, it seems that at some point cats saw the potential value to themselves of humans. John Gray's wonderful new book is an attempt to get to grips with the philosophical and moral issues around the uniquely strange relationship between ourselves and these remarkable animals.  Feline Philosophy  draws on centuries of philosophy, from Montaigne to Schopenhauer, to explore the complex and intimate links that have defined how we react to and behave with this most unlikely 'pet'. At the heart of the book is a sense of gratitude towards cats as perhaps the species that more than any other - in the essential loneliness of our position in the world - gives us a sense of our own animal nature. \u00a9 John Gray 2020 (P) Penguin Audio 2020.

Within a few weeks, Bunny was using it all the time and Alexis, encouraged by Bunny's progress, continued to introduce more buttons and more words . . .  Three years later, Bunny can now communicate using over one hundred buttons, stringing together important, relatable, philosophical phrases such as \"Love you Mom,\" \"Dad went poop,\" and \"Ugh why?\" In I Am Bunny, a memoir in essays and beautiful, full-color photographs, Alexis chronicles not only how Bunny learned to \"talk,\" but also the profound impact their journey has had on her life. Caring for Bunny has revealed to Alexis a path to self-acceptance, if not complete self-love, and as their relationship developed and their ability to communicate deepened, Alexis was able to reflect on and reframe her past traumas in a newly vulnerable and healing way. Helping Bunny through her fear and reactivity allowed Alexis to examine these qualities in herself, and as she created a safe space for Bunny, she too found space for her own healing.  Through charming anecdotes about day-to-day life with Bunny, explorations into prior animal language studies, and plenty of irreverent humor, daring, and heart, Alexis tells the story of how she and Bunny have become so inspiringly close, and explores the ancient and unique bond between dog and guardian that so many of us know leads to a deeper, more meaningful life.

                "A collection of articles, based on modern science, using force free and fear free methods Solutions to common issues from pre-puppy to adulthood The book is a compilation of articles written by these professionals on various aspects of puppy and dog ownership, care, training, and managing and treating behavior problems. As such, you do not need to read the book cover to cover, but the articles are compiled in such a way that it will take you through in a sensible order if that's what you wish to do. Alternatively, you can skip to whichever issue you wish to look up and read articles about it. If previous knowledge of a preceding article is required, it is usually mentioned in the article you're reading. A Collaboration of Force-Free Professionals It is good to see some articles referring back to others written by a different author, proving that this is indeed a collaboration between like-minded professionals and the advice isn't coming from a singular source. All of the writers do well at maintaining an overall 'tone' but of course, they write as individuals so you do get different voices. You may find you prefer some to others. Despite a generally professional voice, the tone is friendly, and at (appropriate) times, humorous. From a grammar perspective, it is well written, so easy to read. Something for Everyone Some of the articles are brief and provide a quick and easy read; others are more lengthy, but the formatting and editing breaks them up well with subheadings making the text much easier to take in. The advice is well presented without complex jargon and easy for anyone to take in, from people brand new to dog training to seasoned professionals looking for another way of presenting their information or an alternative method. Easy to understand anecdotes and comparisons help people to understand their dogs' perceptions of situations. "

The truth is no one is perfect, so cut yourself a little slack; bringing up a puppy who's imperfectly perfect  for you  makes much more sense. Having worked with over 5,000 dogs, Graeme Hall has a unique understanding of the early developmental period. Now he is here to help with his stress-free guide to training and caring for your puppy, so that they grow into a happy, well-adjusted dog. From choosing the right puppy for your lifestyle (including the benefits of a rescue or disabled puppy) and preparing for them to come home, to the crucial socialisation period, early training and adolescence, Graeme covers everything you need to know. All whilst providing useful insight and research into puppy behaviour which will prevent problems later in life.  Perfectly Imperfect Puppy  gives expert advice on how you can give your puppy the best start, breaking down why techniques work, so you get the best results, leading to a happy home for everyone. \u00a9 Graeme Hall 2022 (P) Penguin Audio 2022.

This book \u2013 almost as adorable as its namesake \u2013 proves that sausage dogs are not just sweet, soft and a little bit silly to look at. They can be an example to us all. Despite having the odds stacked against it, this little pooch can turn any situation to its advantage. It's the underdog that always comes out on top, displaying remarkable resilience, tenacity and bravery at every turn. Sausage dogs may be only ankle high, but they will stop at nothing to live life to the fullest, teaching us humans some valuable life lessons along the way. They don't care that they look more like a wind-up toy than a fierce guard dog, or that their bark is much louder than their bite. Being more sausage is about breaking free from restraints, overcoming physical and emotional shortcomings, and chewing up the social conventions that conspire to hold us back. This is our chance to unleash that inner dachshund, live long and prosper!. "

As one of the few exotic animal experts in California, he was just as likely to be treating a lion as a house cat. The Vet at Noah's Ark follows Dr. Mader and his staff over the course of a year at Noah's Ark Veterinary Hospital, an inner-city LA area veterinary hospital where Dr. Mader treats not only dogs and cats, but also emus, skunks, snakes, foxes, monkeys, and a host of other exotic animals. This real life drama is set against the backdrop of the trial of four police officers in the Rodney King case, as well as the violent aftermath following their acquittal. This is a book about survival, both of the pets that Dr. Mader and his staff try to save on a daily basis, as well as the staff themselves. Living in the harsh reality of the city, surrounded by gangs, drugs, violence, traffic, smog, and deadly riots, they must overcome and rise above, for their own survival and that of the animals who need them. This awe-inspiring account is told through Dr. Mader's riveting storytelling-as Carl Hiaasen writes, \"Doug is fearless and dedicated,\" and \"a damn good storyteller.\" "

                "Mountains Beyond Mountains meets Tattoos On the Heart in this unforgettable, powerful, and stunningly-told memoir of a struggling veterinarian saving animals and humans on the streets of California - and how he discovered what bonds all living creatures.   Dr. Kwane Stewart was questioning his career as a veterinarian when he saw a homeless man with a flea-infested dog outside of a convenience store. In a moment of spontaneous generosity, he offered to examine the dog and treat him for free. It was the first step in a now nine-year journey that has taken Dr. Kwane from Skid Row to San Francisco and beyond to care for pets and their humans who are living on the streets.  In What It Takes to Save a Life, Dr. Kwane shows how our four-legged, feathered, scaled, and swimming family members\u2014these dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, and other animals that live side by side with us\u2014provide more than companionship. They offer essential love, hope, and a sense of security.  Written with striking honesty and rich detail, Dr. Kwane looks back on his childhood, how he discovered his appreciation for animals and his calling, and offers a frank assessment of the state of veterinary medicine today, where compassion fatigue, burnout, and suicide are facts of life. Full of warm and inspiring stories of human-animal relationships, this powerful and eye-opening book is a reminder that we are all members of a wider family. It is also a clarion call for each of us to help those in need\u2014especially our most vulnerable brothers and sisters\u2014and the animals who are their families. Wise and warm, Dr. Stewart's story is a reminder that one life can make an immeasurable difference. "

The domestic cat\u2014 your  cat\u2014has, from its evolutionary origins in Africa, been transformed in comparatively little time into one of the most successful and diverse species on the planet. Jonathan Losos, writing as both a scientist and a cat lover, explores how researchers today are unraveling the secrets of the cat, past and present, using all the tools of modern technology, from GPS tracking (you\u2019d be amazed where those backyard cats roam) and genomics (what is your so-called Siamese cat . . . really?) to forensic archaeology. In addition to solving the mysteries of your cat's past, it gives us a cat's-eye view of today's habitats, including meeting wild cousins around the world whose habits your sweet house cat sometimes eerily parallels. Do lions and tigers meow? If not, why not? Why does my cat leave a dead mouse at my feet (or on my pillow)? Is a pet ocelot a bad idea? When and why did the cat make its real leap off the African plain? What\u2019s with all those cats in Egyptian hieroglyphics? In a genial voice, casually deciphering complex science and history with many examples from his own research and multi-cat household, Losos explores how selection, both natural and artificial, over the last several millennia has shaped the contemporary cat, with new breeds vastly different in anatomy and behavior from their ancestral stock. Yet the cat, ever a predator, still seems only one paw out of the wild, and readily reverts to its feral ways as it occupies new lands around the world. Humans are transforming cats, and they in turn are transforming the world around them. This charming and intelligent book suggests what the future may hold for both  Felis catus  and  Homo sapiens .

What he discovered is that our greatest spiritual teachers are at our feet. Literally. They are the cats we love and treasure. Nearly 60 million cats live in US households today. These feline teachers have much to offer us about living in the present, loving unconditionally, approaching life with a sense of playfulness, and trusting others, all the while being independent spirits. Jon Sweeney, beloved scholar and author of The Pope's Cat and numerous books about Saint Francis, offers a playful, gentle, informed meditation on the many spiritual truths and practices our feline companions provide if we but pause and pay attention.

The Handbook for a Happy Cat  takes us inside the feline mind to decode what our cats really want in life and how they try to tell us. You'll learn: Why a bigger water bowl does away with \"whisker stress\"  How to move like a mouse for maximum fun at playtime  Skills to teach your kitten for a lifetime of easy vet visits, grooming, and more  Subtle signs of stress such as excessive scent-marking and lip-licking  How to tell frolic from fighting in the multi-cat household (and how to give frenemies a fresh start)  What makes a scratching post so tempting that your sofa will be spared  How to reassure a spooked cat with the \"slow blink\"  Why it's pointless to \"punish\" a cat\u2014but training  is  possible!

A heartwarming memoir about one woman's career as a vet and the unique role pets play in our lives\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u201cFilled with compassion and wisdom, Karen Fine is a healer whose own wounds have deepened her gifts for bringing animals and their people comfort and peace.\u201d\u00a0\u2014Sy Montgomery,  New York Times  bestselling author of  The Soul of an Octopus  and  How to Be a Good Creature   \u00a0  A\u00a0tribute to our furry, feathery, scaley, and wet family members,  All Creatures Great and Small  meets  Being Mortal  in this compelling memoir of one woman's dream to become a veterinarian.  Karen Fine always knew that she wanted to be a vet and wasn't going to let anything stop her: not her allergy to cats, and not the fact that in the '80s veterinary medicine was still a mostly male profession. Inspired by her grandfather, a compassionate doctor who paid house calls to all his (human) patients, Dr. Fine persevered, and brought her\u00a0Oupa's principles into her own practice, which\u00a0emphasizes the need to understand her patients\u2019 stories to provide the best possible care. \u00a0 And in  The Other Family Doctor , Dr. Fine shares all these touching, joyful, heartbreaking, and life-affirming tales that make up her career as a vet. There's: \u2022 The feral cat who becomes a creature out of a fable when he puts his trust in a young vet to heal his injured paw \u2022 The pot-bellied pig who grows too big to fit in the car but remains a cherished part of her family  \u2022 The surprising colony of perfectly behaved ferrets \u2022 The beloved aging pet who gives her people the gift of accompanying them on one final family vacation \u2022 The dog who saves his owner's life in a most unexpected way \u00a0 Woven into Dr. Fine's story are, of course, also the stories of her own pets: the birds, cats, and dogs who have taught her the most valuable lessons\u2014how caring for the animals in our lives can teach us to better care for ourselves, especially when life seems precarious.  *Includes a downloadable PDF of additional resources and guides from the book.

                "Brought to you by Penguin.    Have you ever wished you could get the dogs in your life to behave better?  Enter Graeme Hall: The Dogfather. Having worked with more than 5,000 dogs - from Great Danes to Chihuahuas, and everything in-between - he's seen pretty much every behavioural issue going and whether it's house-destruction, fear and anxiety, or aggression, he's fixed it.  Backed up by scientific research, Graeme has established a set of golden rules for dog training which he follows each and every time he works with dogs and their people. His simple, practical and effective rules will enable you to understand your dog and help you drive better behaviours. With chapters on communication, rewards, getting a puppy, kids and dogs, lead walking, and much more, Graeme has an answer for every dog-related worry imaginable. You will learn how to talk to dogs like he does - and understand what they're saying in return. You'll find out how to be a kind leader your dog will willingly follow and you'll get to see why excitement might be at the root of the problem.  A dog with behavioural issues is an unhappy dog. And likely has an unhappy owner. But the good news is, at heart, every dog wants to be a good dog. Through sharing entertaining and sometimes hilarious stories of some of the very special dogs Graeme has loved or helped,  All Dogs Great and Small  will give you the tools to help your beloved pooch practise perfect manners, and bring much-needed harmony to your home. \u00a9 Graeme Hall 2021 (P) Penguin Audio 2021.

Then, at age fifty-one, she was diagnosed with cancer herself.  Sit, Stay, Heal: What Dogs Can Teach Us About Living Well is Dr. Renee's unforgettable testament to the extraordinary healing nature of dogs. Every day in her veterinary practice, she bears witness to the undeniable bond between pets and their people. However, while we are busy teaching them to \"sit\" and \"stay,\" they have their own, more profound, lessons to impart. In Sit, Stay, Heal, we meet Cosmo, the golden retriever who arrives at Renee's office just before his fourteenth family vacation to the beach; Daisy, the cocker spaniel, an emotional support dog for a special needs child; and Franny, the bloodhound, a police dog who wasn't ready to retire from the force. Then there's Dr. Renee's own dog Newtie, who falls ill when she needs him most.  Our dogs are wise in ways humans are not. For Dr. Renee, it was her patients\u2014those furry, four-legged, slobbering animals\u2014who seemed to uniquely understand her difficult journey and who showed her the true power of positivity and unconditional love. Full of life lessons and healing metaphors, perfect dogs and their imperfect humans, Sit, Stay, Heal is a captivating, heartwarming story for dog lovers far and wide. "

Dr. Schott also pulls back the curtain on what it's really like to be a veterinarian. Do some vet students faint at the sight of blood? (Yes.) Is it easier for vets to bring their own pets in for procedures? (No.) Did the pandemic change veterinary practice? (Yes, and how.)  You will also learn how to bathe a dog, why some rats love cats, why Dr. Schott is afraid of parrots, and a surprising way for a dog to accidentally get drunk. And, of course, you will meet Supercat, the Siamese kitten with the mightiest lungs. "

Along the way, animal chaplain Sarah Bowen shares insights for sustaining their lives, honoring deaths, and managing the emotions that arise when we lose an animal we love. While many books focus exclusively on pet loss, animal welfare, or environmental issues, Bowen's ever curious and playful style takes on all three, revealing their unavoidable entanglement. Sacred Sendoffs helps animal lovers uncover practical actions and everyday opportunities for helping the more-than-human world thrive. "

                "What is it like to be a puppy? Author of the classic  Inside of a Dog , Alexandra Horowitz tries to find out, spending a year scrutinizing her puppy\u2019s daily existence and poring over the science of early dog development  Few of us meet our dogs at Day One. The dog who will, eventually, become an integral part of our family, our constant companion and best friend, is born without us into a family of her own. A puppy's critical early development into the dog we come to know is usually missed entirely. Dog researcher Alexandra Horowitz aimed to change that with her family's new pup, Quiddity (Quid). In this scientific memoir, she charts Quid's growth from wee grub to boisterous sprite, from her birth to her first birthday. \u00a0 Horowitz follows Quid's first weeks with her mother and ten roly-poly littermates, and then each week after the puppy joins her household of three humans, two large dogs, and a wary cat. She documents the social and cognitive milestones that so many of us miss in our puppies' lives, when caught up in the housetraining and behavioral training that easily overwhelms the first months of a dog's life with a new family. In focusing on training a dog to behave, we mostly miss the radical development of a puppy into  themselves \u2014through the equivalent of infancy, childhood, young adolescence, and teenager-hood. \u00a0 By slowing down to observe Quid from week to week,  The Year of the Puppy  makes new sense of a dog's behavior in a way that is missed when the focus is only on training. Horowitz keeps a lens on the puppy's point of view\u2014how they (begin to) see and smell the world, make meaning of it, and become an individual personality. She's there when the puppies first open their eyes, first start to recognize one another and learn about cats, sheep, and people; she sees them from their first play bows to puberty. Horowitz also draws from the ample research in the fields of dog and human development to draw analogies between a dog's first year and the growing child\u2014and to note where they diverge.  The Year of the Puppy  is indispensable for anyone navigating their way through the frustrating, amusing, and ultimately delightful first year of a puppy\u2019s life. "

                "From historian-in-residence at the Presidential Pet Museum, Andrew Hager, comes a fond, fascinating, and often surprising look at the dogs who were the best friends of the presidents, featuring unforgettable photographs.    President Biden's German shepherds, Major and the late Champ, are the latest in a long line of presidential dogs. Dating all the way back to George Washington, dogs have been constant companions to nearly all of America's presidents. Of the past 46 presidents, 31 have had at least one dog at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  Organized by historical eras, All-American Dogs will take readers through the captivating history of the White House's four-legged friends, the impact they had on their owner-in-chiefs, and, ultimately, American history. From the assassination of President's Lincoln's dog after Lincoln's own death to President's Hoover's Belgian shepherd, King Tut, who helped President Hoover win the election after appearing in a campaign photo, these furry members of the first family often had a lasting impact on the administrations that kept them.  As historian-in-residence at the Presidential Pet Museum, Andrew Hager will include original research and rare photographs from the National Archives to trace the history of America's first dogs. From post-Revolutionary dogs, to Civil War era dogs, to Cold War dogs, Hager will show the differences and similarities of how our nation viewed man's best friend.  Readers will learn not only past presidents' dogs in each historical era, but also the cultural history of dogs as pets, and the ways in which Americans' relationships with dogs has evolved over the past two centuries.

Lissa Bachner was born with a passion for horses and won her first blue ribbon at age five. Other awards would follow as a young rider, and for years Lissa trained with jumpers, tackling more difficult leaps, and working to perfect her ride. When blindness struck in her teens, it appeared her passion for riding would come to an end. How could she jump hurdles when she could barely navigate through her own home? But success, trust, and love came to Lissa when her trainer convinced her to buy a \"diamond in the rough\" from Germany. On New Year's Eve, Milo arrived at the barn, frightened and neglected. Taking one look at his shaking, filthy body, Lissa promised Milo that he would only know kindness. Through countless eye surgeries and the many months of training and work, Lissa and Milo formed a magic bond that made them inseparable. With effortless humor and penetrating compassion, Lissa weaves a story of unfaltering faith in Milo, and the unconditional love they shared. "

                "An unexpected, poignant, and personal account of loving and losing pets, exploring the singular bonds we have with our companion animals, and how to grieve them once they've passed.   E.B. Bartels has had a lot of pets\u2014dogs, birds, fish, tortoises. As varied a bunch as they are, they've taught her one universal truth: to own a pet is to love a pet, and to own a pet is also\u2014with rare exception\u2014to lose that pet in time.  But while we have codified traditions to mark the passing of our fellow humans, most cultures don't have the same for pets. Bartels takes us from Massachusetts to Japan, from ancient Egypt to the modern era, in search of the good pet death. We meet veterinarians, archaeologists, ministers, and more, offering an idiosyncratic, inspiring array of rituals\u2014from the traditional (scattering ashes, commissioning a portrait), to the grand (funereal processions, mausoleums), to the unexpected (taxidermy, cloning). The central lesson: there is no best practice when it comes to mourning your pet, except to care for them in death as you did in life, and find the space to participate in their end as fully as you can.  Punctuated by wry, bighearted accounts of Bartels's own pets and their deaths, Good Grief is a cathartic companion through loving and losing our animal family.

Each chapter offers a life lesson about trusting one's instincts, honestly addressing emotions, achieving clarity in communications, and releasing negative thoughts. Because survival depends on being highly tuned to the thoughts and feelings of others, horses sense human intentions rather than what a person offers in facial expressions, which creates a remarkable effect on the relationship between these two distinctly different species. Among the moving stories the author relates are a horse named Hope who teaches the difference between hope and faith; an abused horse's background bringing up old memories and helping the author to move on; a young Olympic equestrienne hopeful who discovers and reaffirms her self-esteem; and a corporate training session in which one participant achieves great success merely by being honest about her fears. As you see how these people grow deeper into themselves as they learn the horse's way, you, too, will be inspired to explore and apply the deep and everlasting connection and communication between horses and humans.

                "GET TO KNOW YOUR DOG. Renowned expert dog trainer and bestselling author of Lucky Dog Lessons Brandon McMillan unpacks the unique and often misunderstood 15,000-year evolutionary history governing a dog's every move.   Most dog owners know the truth\u2014their dogs are totally incompatible with the modern world. Instincts like herding, chasing, and protecting have no natural outlet and frequently result in chewing, barking, nipping, jumping, lunging, and worse. However, as McMillan argues in these pages, the solution isn't as simple as mastering \"sit\" and \"stay.\"   No matter what kind of dog you have, no matter how old or young or well trained or well-bred, your beloved companion is strongly influenced by his DNA. The result of these genetic distinctions shows up in every inch and action\u2014from the size and shape of a dog's head (and the brain inside it) to the length and curve of his tail, from the texture of her fur to the webbing (or lack of webbing) between her toes. It's in their lung capacity, their tolerance for heat and cold, their appetites for food and exercise, and whether and how they bark. It goes beyond their structure and deep into their psychological profiles. Perhaps you're lucky enough to have a dog with more than a few breeds mixed in, which makes this information all the more crucial to know and understand.   In The Story of Your Dog, McMillan breaks down why your dog acts the way it does, so you can train better and easier, with fewer missteps and miscommunications, and bond in ways you never thought possible. It is an invitation to get to know the sometimes frustrating but always incredible dog at the other end of the leash. "

A veterinarian and a journalist answer this question with a resounding \"yes,\" and offer real-life guidance for opening up your cat's world, even if they stay within the confines of your home.  There are many myths our culture perpetuates about domestic cats: they live longer indoors, sleep all day, are easy and low-maintenance pets, and can't be trained. Even the most well-meaning kitty caregiver will be surprised to learn that these long-held beliefs aren't necessarily based on facts, but instead reflect the many ways we have adapted our feline friends to our indoor, domesticated lifestyles. Indoor Cat , by Laura J. Moss, journalist and founder of  Adventure Cats , and Lynn Bahr, a feline-only veterinarian, explores how to help cat owners understand a cat's perspective of their indoor homes, with practical ways to enhance cats' lives to the fullest and combat countless health and behavioral problems that result from indoor living, as well as raising the question: should every cat live exclusively indoors?Together with scientific studies, expert opinions from vets and behaviorists, and firsthand accounts and interviews, this informative and engaging full-color guide strives to reach compassionate cat owners looking for new ways to care for and connect with their feline companions.

Would dogs be able to survive on their own without us? A Dog's World imagines a posthuman future for dogs, revealing how dogs would survive-and possibly even thrive-and explaining how this new and revolutionary perspective can guide how we interact with dogs now. Drawing on biology, ecology, and the latest findings on the lives and behavior of dogs and their wild relatives, Jessica Pierce and Marc Bekoff-two of today's most innovative thinkers about dogs-explore who dogs might become without direct human intervention into breeding, arranged playdates at the dog park, regular feedings, and veterinary care. Pierce and Bekoff show how dogs are quick learners who are highly adaptable and opportunistic, and they offer compelling evidence that dogs already do survive on their own-and could do so in a world without us. Challenging the notion that dogs would be helpless without their human counterparts, A Dog's World enables us to understand these independent and remarkably intelligent animals on their own terms. "

                "The rescue of the last diving horse in America and the moving, inspiring story of how horse and animal rescuer were each profoundly transformed by the other, from the award-winning animal rescuer of retired racing greyhounds and author of the best-selling  Adopting the Racing Greyhound     \u00a0  It was the signature of Atlantic City\u2019s Steel Pier in the golden age of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Favorite Playground\u201d: Doc Carver\u2019s High Diving Horses. Beginning in 1929, four times a day, seven days a week, a trained horse wearing only a harness ran up a ramp, a diving girl in a bathing suit and helmet jumped onto its mighty bare back, and together they sailed forty feet through the air, plung\u00ading, to thunderous applause, into a ten-foot-deep tank of water.   \u00a0  Decades later, after cries of animal abuse and chang\u00ading times, the act was shuttered, and in May 1980, the last Atlantic City Steel Pier diving horse was placed on the auction block in Indian Mills, New Jersey. The au\u00adthor, who had seen the act as a child and had been haunted by it, was now working with Cleveland Amory, the founding father of the modern animal protection movement, and she was, at the last minute, sent on a rescue mission: bidding for the horse everyone had come to buy, some for the slaughterhouse (they dropped out when the bidding exceeded his weight). The author\u2019s winning bid: $2,600\u2014and Gamal, gleaming-coated, majestic, commanding, was hers; she who knew almost nothing about horses was now the owner of the last div\u00ading horse in America.   \u00a0  Cynthia Branigan tells the magical, transformative story of how horse and new owner (who is trying to sort out her own life, feeling somewhat lost herself and in need of rescuing) come to know each other, educate each other, and teach each other important lessons of living and loving. She writes of providing a new home for Gamal, a farm with plentiful fields of rich, grazing pasture; of how Gamal, at age twenty-six, blossoms in his new circumstances; and of the special bond that slowly grows and deepens between them, as Gamal tests the author and grows to trust her, and as she grows to rely upon him as friend, confidant, teacher.   \u00a0  She writes of her search for Gamal\u2019s past: moved from barn to barn, from barrel racer to rodeo horse, and ending up on the Steel Pier; how his resilience and dig\u00adnity throughout those years give deep meaning to his life; and how in understanding this, the author is freed from her own past, which had been filled with doubts and fears and darkness. Branigan writes of the history of diving horses and of how rescuing and caring for Gamal led to her saving other animals\u2014burros, llamas, and goats\u2014first as company for Gamal and then finding homes for them all; and, finally, saving a ten-year-old retired greyhound called King\u2014despondent, nearly broken in spirit\u2014who, running free in the fields with Gamal, comes back to his happy self and opens up for the author a whole new surprising but purposeful world.   \u00a0  A captivating tale of the power of animals and the love that can heal the heart and restore the soul.

                "Unlock the secret code of cats for a deeper connection with the feline in your life. Why does my cat always sleep on my keyboard? How can I stop them bullying the dog? Why will they only drink from the bathroom tap? Do they even like me? If you've ever wondered, as they sit on your head at 4am, what's going on behind your cat's inscrutable gaze, this audiobook has the answers. Drawing on animal behaviour, psychology and the latest research, it reveals what's really behind the amusing, endearing, or downright weird things cats do. Cats may not telegraph their emotions (unlike the dogs they look down on!) but they do show their feelings, often quite subtly. This audiobook helps you to interpret your cat's body language and behaviours, so you'll know when they're confident and contented, and when they're telling you that something's not right. Advanced Catwatching features put the spotlight on key behaviours such as sofa-scratching, while Survival Guides offer top tips for managing challenges such as moving house, or introducing a new cat into the family. What's My Cat Thinking? will deepen your understanding of your cat and strengthen the unique connection between you. So when they give you that 4am wake-up call, at least you'll know why. Dr Jo Lewis is an award-winning Veterinary Surgeon and director of The Cat Vet. With a lifelong love of cats, Jo has more than 20 years experience and is an active member of the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM). She set up The Cat Vet to promote the health and wellbeing of cats by taking routine veterinary care to the place where cats feel most at ease - their own home. "

Speck is not a good boy. He is a terrible boy, a defiant, self-destructive, often malodorous boy, a grave robber and screen door moocher who spends his days playing chicken with the Fed Ex man, picking fights with thousand-pound livestock, and rolling in donkey manure, and his nights howling at the moon. He has been that way since the moment he appeared on the ridgeline behind Rick Bragg's house, a starved and half-dead creature, seventy-six pounds of wet hair and poor decisions.  Speck arrived in Rick's life at a moment of looming uncertainty.  A cancer diagnosis, chemo, kidney failure, and recurring pneumonia had left Rick lethargic and melancholy. Speck helped, and he is helping, still, when he is not peeing on the rose of Sharon. Written with Bragg's inimitable blend of tenderness and sorrow, humor and grit,  The Speckled Beauty  captures the extraordinary, sustaining devotion between two damaged creatures who need each other to heal.

When Connecticut veterinarian Melissa Shapiro gets a call about a tiny deaf blind puppy rescued from a hoarding situation in need of fostering, she doesn't hesitate to say, \"yes.\" Little does she know how that decision will transform her, her family, and legions of admirers destined to embrace the saga of the indomitable pink pup.    One of the most anxious dogs Melissa had ever encountered, the traumatized Piglet weighed under two pounds upon his welcome into the Shapiro household\u2014which included Melissa's husband Warren and their three college-aged kids, plus six other rescued dogs. After weeks of reassurance, and lots of love, Piglet connected, gained confidence, and his extraordinary spirit emerged. Melissa soon forged a powerful bond with Piglet, allowing the two to communicate without sound or visual cues.    Two months later, when the day arrived to say good-bye to the now dashing, six-pound pink boy dog with the larger than life spirit, Melissa faced a heart-wrenching decision. Could she hand him over to someone willing to give Piglet the full-time attention he required or could she adapt her schedule and her household to make a permanent place for him in her life and work? Of course, the answer was simple: love would find a way.    Curious, engaged, and incredibly eager to learn, Piglet quickly became part of the family. What started out as a few simple Facebook posts of Piglet and his pack rapidly evolved into a global celebration of Piglet's infectiously positive mindset.  Piglet  : The Unexpected Story of a Deaf, Blind, Pink Puppy and His Family  fully illustrates this heartwarming story of one special little puppy with a purpose to teach the power of empathy, love, and kindness.

Drawing on stories of animals both wild and domestic, the two authors, also best friends, created this book to put humans back into the animal world. The more we learn about what other animals think and do, they explain, the more we understand ourselves as animals, too. Writes Montgomery, \"The list of attributes once thought to be unique to our species\u2015from using tools to waging war\u2015is not only rapidly shrinking, but starting to sound less and less impressive when we compare them with other animals' powers.\"   With humor, empathy, and introspection, Montgomery and Thomas look into the lives of all kinds of creatures\u2015from man's best friend to the great white shark\u2015and examine the ways we connect with our fellow species. Both authors have devoted their lives to sharing the animal kingdom's magic with others, and their combined wisdom is an indispensable contribution to the field of animal literature.   The book contains a foreword by Vicki Constantine Croke, author of the bestseller\u00a0Elephant Company. "

                "On the heels of her family's beloved dog's death, one woman returns to the canines of her past in order to imagine the human she hopes to become in the future in her memoir,  What Is a Dog?   Chloe Shaw is in a dog house of her own choosing. A married mother with kids, the death of Booker, her children's eldest family pet, has left her reeling and reckoning with her lifelong relationship with dogs. Unable to shake the feeling a year later, she asks her family for some time alone to be with nothing but her thoughts and remaining canines, Safari and Otter\u2014only to find the dogs of her past pawing at her every memory and running, sticks in mouths, back into her life. What follows is a meditation on one woman's life through the dogs she's loved and lost. Since she was a child, Shaw had learned to escape the hardest parts of being human by immersing herself in the lives of her canine companions, an adaptive attachment that carried her to adulthood. Yet, in marriage and motherhood, Shaw finds herself facing her most human struggles yet. Her old ways of \"being the dog\" in the face of hardship prove destructive, and it's not until she's able to love herself and learn from the dogs of her past and present that can she truly thrive as a person, and show up for the family who needs her to be their person. With artful prose and a philosophical touch, Shaw takes us on an emotional journey anyone who has ever loved and lost a dog will connect with\u2014and discovers dogs do more than just make our lives better\u2014they quietly (and sometimes loudly) pull us boldly toward the person we were always meant to be.

                "\" Sparkles with humor, joy and wit. London's Number One Dog-Walking Agency bounds along with the energy of a rambunctious pup and exudes the wisdom of a beloved canine with an old soul (you know the type).\" \u2014 BookPage    The irresistibly charming memoir of a young woman who started her own business as a dog walker for London's busy, well-heeled dog lovers. A true love letter to London, dogs, and growing up.    Aside from the odd biter or growler, the occasional bolter and the one dog who didn't want to walk, the canines were the easy part. They were a muddy, messy joy in all shapes, sizes and breeds, from greedy Labradors to pampered pugs and everything in between. It was the owners who were the real challenge, a giddy mix of the over-protective, the clueless, the eccentrics and the perfectionists. There is no rule book on how to navigate the obsessions of the London dog owner. A degree in human psychology would have been far preferable to any sort of animal qualification. Not that I had either...  In 2006, Kate MacDougall was working a safe but dull job at the venerable auction house Sotheby's in London. After a clumsy accident nearly destroyed a precious piece of art, she quit Sotheby's and set up her own dog-walking company. Kate knew little about dogs and nothing about business, and no one thought being a professional dog walker was a good use of her university degree. Nevertheless, Kate embarked upon an entirely new and very much improvised career walking some of the city's many pampered pooches, branding her company \"London's Number One Dog Walking Agency.\"   With sharp wit, delightful observations, and plenty of canine affection, Kate reveals her unique and unconventional coming-of-age story, as told through the dogs, and the London homes and neighborhoods they inhabit. One walk at a time, she journeys from a haphazard twentysomething to a happily\u2014and surprisingly\u2014settled adult, with love, relationships, drama, and home ownership along the way. But, as Kate says, \"It's all down to the dogs\" and what they taught her about London\u2014and life. "

                "The author of the heartwarming Craig and Fred tells the deeply emotional and inspiring story of the next phase of their lives together: working closely with prison inmates in Maine who raise and train puppies to become service dogs.  Former US Marine Craig Grossi and his dog Fred appeared on the \"Today Show' and 'Rachael Ray', and in schools, bookstores, and military bases across America as they told the uplifting story of how Craig found Fred, a stray, while serving in Afghanistan\u2014and brought him home. During their travels, Craig was invited to speak at Maine State Prison\u2014the penitentiary that inspired Stephen King's famous \"Shawshank.\" While there, he met a group of very special inmates, participants in a program run by the non-profit America's Vet Dogs.  Craig discovered that many of the prisoners are veterans\u2014former soldiers serving their country in an entirely different way: by transforming purebred Labrador Retrievers from floppy puppies into indispensable companions for disabled vets. These service dogs literally and figuratively open doors for men and women, offering hope and a renewed sense of freedom.   Yet these disabled vets are not the only lives changed by these dogs. The inmates who train them \"are given a purpose, they're given experience, and most importantly they're given a sense of self-worth,\" Craig explains. \"The men at Maine State are given a second chance\u2014something that I believe everyone deserves.\" For Craig, the visit had a profound impact. \"There was something special going on inside its walls and it was calling out to me. I quickly realized that the program and its men had something to show the world.\"  In this emotionally powerful book, he introduces these men and challenges us to look deeper, to see them as human beings deserving of a new shot at life. \"We're quick to give second chances to celebrities, politicians and famous athletes when they screw up,\" Craig reminds us, \"but when it comes to those who've been convicted for their mistakes, we too often dismiss them as forever lost.\" Second Chances poignantly shows that no life is irredeemable and that each of us can make a difference if given the opportunity.

                "An incredible, revolutionary true story and surprisingly simple guide to teaching your dog to talk from speech-language pathologist Christina Hunger, who has taught her dog, Stella, to communicate using simple paw-sized buttons associated with different words.    When speech-language pathologist Christina Hunger first came home with her puppy, Stella, it didn't take long for her to start drawing connections between her job and her new pet. During the day, she worked with toddlers with significant delays in language development and used Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices to help them communicate. At night, she wondered: If dogs can understand words we say to them, shouldn't they be able to say words to us? Can dogs use AAC to communicate with humans?  Christina decided to put her theory to the test with Stella and started using a paw-sized button programmed with her voice to say the word \"outside\" when clicked, whenever she took Stella out of the house. A few years later, Stella now has a bank of more than thirty word buttons, and uses them daily either individually or together to create near-complete sentences.  How Stella Learned to Talk is part memoir and part how-to guide. It chronicles the journey Christina and Stella have taken together, from the day they met, to the day Stella \"spoke\" her first word, and the other breakthroughs they've had since. It also reveals the techniques Christina used to teach Stella, broken down into simple stages and actionable steps any dog owner can use to start communicating with their pets.  Filled with conversations that Stella and Christina have had, as well as the attention to developmental detail that only a speech-language pathologist could know, How Stella Learned to Talk will be the indispensable dog book for the new decade.

                "This program is read by the author. A memoir of love and loss, of being in the right place at the right time, and of the mysterious ways a beloved pet can bring people together, from CBS Sunday Morning News correspondent and multi-Emmy-Award-winning Martha Teichner.  There  are  true fairy tales. Stories that exist because impossible-to-explain coincidences change everything. Except in real life, not all of them have conventional, happily-ever-after endings.  When Harry Met Minnie  is that kind of fairy tale, with the vibrant, romantic New York City backdrop of its namesake, the movie  When Harry Met Sally , and the bittersweet wisdom of  Tuesdays with Morrie . There's a special camaraderie among early-morning dog walkers. Gathering at dog runs in the park, or strolling through the farmer's market at Union Square before the bustling crowd appears, fellow pet owners become familiar\u2013as do the personalities of their beloved animals. In this special space and time, a chance encounter with an old acquaintance changed Martha Teichner's world. As fate would have it, her friend knew someone who was dying of cancer, from exposure to toxins after 9/11, and desperate to find a home for her dog, Harry.

                "From one of the Internet's most original voices, a hilarious journey through the odd corners of obsessive dog ownership and the author's own infatuation with her perfect dog Peter.    The author met Peter in the spring of 2017. He\u2014calm, puppy-eyed, with the heart of a poet and the soul of, also, a poet\u2014came to her first as a foster. He was unable to stay with his previously assigned foster for reasons that are none of your business, but which we will tell you were related to frequent urination. The rescue needed someone free of the sort of responsibilities that would force her to regularly leave the house for either work or socializing, and a writer was the natural choice. Thus began a love story for the ages.   THE PARTICULARS OF PETER is a funny exploration of the joy found in loving a dog so much it makes you feel like you're going to combust, and the author's potentially codependent relationship with her own sweet dog, Peter. Readers will follow Peter and his owner to Woofstock, \"the largest outdoor festival for dogs in North America,\" and accompany them to lessons in Canine Freestyle, a sport where dogs perform a routine set to music, creating the illusion that they're dancing with their owners. From learning about Peter's DNA, to seeing if dogs can sense the presence of ghosts, THE PARTICULARS OF PETER will give readers a smart, entertaining respite from the harsh world of humans into the funny little world of dogs.  Readers will accompany this lovable duo through exciting trips, lessons, quiet moments of connection, and probably a failure or two. By fusing memoir and infotainment, THE PARTICULARS OF PETER promises to refresh the perennially popular dog lit category in a scrumptiously bighearted barnstormer of a book. "

And today, cats are peddled on social media as silly creatures here to amuse humans with their antics. But this is an absurd, self-centered fantasy. The true history of felines is one of heroism, love, tragedy, sacrifice, and gravitas. Not entirely convinced? Well, get ready, because Baba the Cat is here to set the record straight. Spanning almost every continent and thousands\u2014yes, thousands\u2014of years, Baba's complex story of feline survival presents listeners with a diverse cast of cats long forgotten: from her prehistoric feline ancestors and the ancient Egyptian cat goddess Bastet to the daring mariners at the height of oceanic discovery, key intellectuals in the Enlightenment period, revered heroes from World Wars I and II, and the infamous American tabbies. Baba, a talented model in addition to a scholar, goes beyond surface-level scratches, pairing her freshly unearthed research with a series of stunning costume portraits to bring history to life. A paws-on journey through the feline hall of fame, with in-depth research and four-legged testaments that will make you rethink who defines history,  A Cat's Tale: A Journey Through Feline History \u2014as revealed to Paul Koudounaris\u2014is a one-of-a-kind chronicle that introduces listeners to the illustrious ancestors of their closest companions and shows, once and for all, that cats know  exactly  what they're doing.

We schedule our days around his needs\u2014his mealtimes, his walks, the delivery of his life-saving medication (he has epilepsy, poor love). We spend a bizarrely large amount of our disposable income on him, and he never sends a card of thanks. When he's not with us for a few days, the house feels extraordinarily empty. I feel so fortunate to know him.\"  Ludo is a dog\u2014Simon Garfield's beloved black Labrador retriever, one of millions of canines who have become integral parts of our lives. But how did the dog become top dog? How did these faithful animals come to assist us not only in hunting, but in bomb disposal and cancer detection\u2014and ultimately become our closest companions? Dog's Best Friend examines how this bond developed over the centuries, and how it has transformed countless lives, both human and canine.  Garfield begins with the earliest visual representations\u2014dogs depicted in ancient rock art\u2014and ends at the laboratory that first sequenced the canine genome. Along the way, we meet the legendary Corgis of Buckingham Palace, the dogs of the Soviet space program, the world's first labradoodle, and a border collie that can identify more than a thousand different plush toys. Garfield reveals the secrets of the world's best dog trainers, takes us inside the wild world of dog breeding and dog shows, and unearths the deep psychological roots of the human-dog link. And Ludo pops his snout in from time to time as well.   A celebration of this deep interspecies connection, delivered with Simon Garfield's inimitable wit, Dog's Best Friend offers delights and insights for anyone who has ever loved a dog. "

When 30-year-old Dean Nicholson set off from Scotland to cycle around the world, his aim was to learn as much as he could about our troubled planet. But he hadn't bargained on the lessons he'd learn from his unlikely companion. Three months after leaving home, on a remote road in the mountains between Montenegro and Bosnia, he came across an abandoned kitten. Something about the piercing eyes and plaintive meowing of the bedraggled little cat proved irresistible. He couldn't leave her to her fate, so he put her on his bike and then, with the help of local vets, nursed her back to health. Soon on his travels with the cat he named Nala, they forged an unbreakable bond - both curious, independent, resilient and adventurous. The video of how they met has had 20 million views and their Instagram has grown to almost 750k followers \u2014 and still counting! Experiencing the kindness of strangers, visiting refugee camps, rescuing animals through Europe and Asia, Dean and Nala have already learned that the unexpected can be pretty amazing. Together with Garry Jenkins, writer with James Bowen of the bestselling  A Street Cat Named Bob , Dean shares the extraordinary tale of his and Nala's inspiring and heart-warming adventure together.

                "An inside look at the forces behind how our pets become treasured members of the family.   In the last 20 years pets have gone from the backyard to sleeping on our beds, then showing up in every corner of America. Pet Nation tells the story of this seismic shift and the economic, media, legal, political, and social dramas springing from this cultural transformation. Since 1998 the pet population in the U.S. has almost doubled \u2014 about two-thirds of the country now owns a pet. No longer left to wander the neighborhood, dogs and cats eat special food, get individualized medical attention, and even fly in the cabin. As founder of the Animal Policy Group, Mark Cushing provides an inside look at the rise of Pet Nation, tracking the myriad ways pets are acquired (a \"Canine Freedom Train\" runs south to north), reporting on pet rights legislation (and the unseen problems that come with elevating their status), pet healthcare (revealing the truth and myths about large scale breeders), and discovering that despite what many organizations would have us believe, there is a shortage of dogs. Insightful, surprising, and full of great stories, Pet Nation opens our eyes to the big changes happening in front of us right now. It shows us not only what our love of animals says about pets, it shows us what it says about ourselves. "

                "The Nature of Animal Healing  is a groundbreaking, inspirational contribution to animal care. Dr. Martin Goldstein, one of the most successful and best-known holistic veterinarians in the country, offers here, for the first time, invaluable insights into how to give our pets a healthy, happy, and long life. Dr. Goldstein\u2014a graduate of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine who runs a renowned clinic in South Salem, New York\u2014begins by explaining his approach to alternative treatment: what it is, how it works, and why it's especially important that animals be treated holistically. Holistic pet care essentially revolves around the notion that the best way to cure an animal who is ill is to help the animal cure itself. We are not the true healers of our pets\u2014they are. By treating the root of the problem instead of its symptoms, holistic medicine enables our pets to regain and maintain their own health. In this comprehensive and accessible book, Dr. Goldstein not only shares his philosophy of how animals should\u2014must\u2014be treated, but also shows us exactly what to do. With moving and often entertaining examples from his years of practice, he offers prescriptive advice for the pet lover of every stripe: why we shouldn't feed our animals commercial pet food; why vaccines can actually do more harm than good; how acupuncture and homeopathic medicine can be used to help our pets; why pets need to experience a \"healing crisis\" in order to get well; and much, much more. In his practice, Dr. Goldstein has had extraordinary success treating cancer and leukemia. Here, he begins to decipher the riddle of those killer diseases and shows us how best to treat them, as well as how to prevent them from occurring. Included is the exhaustive \"Alphabet of Ailments,\" a list that tackles common afflictions one by one\u2014the most useful guide ever published in a book on animal care. Dr. Goldstein also turns to the spiritual realm, addressing how the emotional bonds we form with our animals have the power to provoke and cure disease. In his smart, helpful, and comforting style, he tells us how to deal with the inevitable death of a pet\u2014both physically and psychologically. Finally, there is an indispensable source guide: a complete listing of pet health-care centers, doctors, and products. So wherever you live, you will be able to act on the advice and recommendations you are sure to take to heart.  The Nature of Animal Healing  is a revolutionary guide that no pet owner should be without. "

Witty, poignant and nostalgic, this bestselling memoir continues to find new fans and delight young and old alike. Now available for the first time in audiobook. When Jonathan Franklin takes two baby tawny owls back to Eton, he has no idea how chaotic the following months will be. The birds show no respect for Etonian routine and tradition. They trash his room and rule his daily life, and are known throughout the school as 'Dum' and 'Dee'. Although a keen naturalist, Jonathan struggles to understand his charges and to find the right food for them; at first meat and feathers, soon mice and rats. Even so, they nearly die of malnutrition on two occasions. Frantic, he searches for natural food. How to keep them alive is a constant worry. He watches them grow from ugly balls of fluff into beautiful adults, every change of plumage and behaviour noted. They play truant, they shock others, and lead Jonathan into hilarious adventures. They charm his housemaster and everybody who meets them. Best of all is seeing them flying about over those famous playing fields. All the time, Jonathan works to train them for eventual return to the wild. Will that be possible? He is never sure whether he will succeed. "
