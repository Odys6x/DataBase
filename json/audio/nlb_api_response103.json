                "A picture book edition of the board book about body liberation, offering adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young children in an informed, safe, and supported way\u2014adapted for audio!  Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven audiobook offers clear, concrete language to introduce the concept of BODY LIBERATION. This audiobook serves to celebrate the uniqueness of your body and all bodies, and addresses the unfair rules and ideas that currently exist about bodies. It ends with motivational action points for making the world more fair for all! While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. "

Busy Betty has always been busy . . . even when she was just a baby! When Betty gives Frank a big hug, she realizes he needs a bath, PRONTO! Her best friend, Mae, is coming over, and Betty can\u2019t have the smelliest dog in the whole world! But giving Frank a bath is harder than she thought and just when everything seems impossible, with Mae\u2019s help, Betty learns she can accomplish anything with perseverance, teamwork, and one great idea. From Reese Witherspoon comes a smart and larger-than-life character who encourages young readers to celebrate what makes them unique and realize that anything is possible!  Praise for  Busy Betty:   \"A fun and high-spirited story for the fans of  Fancy Nancy ,  Pinkalicious , or  Freckleface Strawberry .\"\u2014  School Library Journal   \"An earnest and unabashed celebration of youthful entrepreneurial zeal that feels very of the moment.\" \u2014  Publishers Weekly    \"Extreme angles effectively convey a sense of perpetual motion. . . .

Now, she turns her talents inward, mining the benchmarks of her nineties childhood and beyond to analyze the tropes that are shaping all of us, and our ability to shape them right back.  In the opening essay, an interaction with Chance the Rapper prompts an investigation into the origin myth of her name. Elsewhere, Aisha traces the evolution of the \"Black Friend\" trope from its Twainian origins through to the heyday of the Spice Girls, teen comedies like Clueless, and sitcoms of the New Girl variety. And she examines the overlap of taste and identity in this era, rejecting the patriarchal ethos that you are what you like .  Whatever the subject, sitting down with her book feels like hanging out with your smart, hilarious, pop culture\u2013obsessed friend\u2014and it's a delight. "

                "A sharp-witted and deeply insightful look into the storied world of elite prep schools from the first African-American legacy student to graduate from The Taft School  Early on in Kendra James's professional life, she began to feel like she was selling a lie. As an admissions officer specializing in diversity recruitment for independent prep schools, she persuaded students and families to embark on the same perilous journey she herself had made\u2014to attend cutthroat and largely white schools similar to The Taft School, where she had been the first African-American legacy student only a few years earlier. Her new job forced her to reflect on her own elite education experience and to realize how disillusioned she had become with America's inequitable system.  In Admissions, James looks back at the three years she spent at Taft, chronicling clashes with her white roommate, how she had to unlearn the respectability politics she had been raised with, and the fall-out from a horrifying article in the student newspaper that accused Black and Latinx students of being responsible for segregation of campus. Through these stories, some troubling, others hilarious, she deconstructs the lies and half-truths she herself would later tell as an admissions professional, in addition to the myths about boarding schools perpetuated by popular culture.  With its combination of incisive social critique and uproarious depictions of elite nonsense, Admissions will resonate with anyone who has ever been \"the only one\" in a room, dealt with racial microaggressions, or even just suffered from an extreme case of homesickness.

                "As a 6'2\" dreadlocked black man, Tyler Merritt knows what it feels like to be stereotyped as threatening, which can have dangerous consequences. But he also knows that proximity to people who are different from ourselves can be a cure for racism.  Tyler Merritt's video \"Before You Call the Cops\" has been viewed millions of times. He's appeared on  Jimmy Kimmel  and  Sports Illustrated  and has been profiled in the  New York Times . The viral video's main point\u2014the more you know someone, the more empathy, understanding, and compassion you have for that person\u2014is the springboard for this book. By sharing his highs and exposing his lows, Tyler welcomes us into his world in order to help bridge the divides that seem to grow wider every day.In  I Take My Coffee Black,  Tyler tells hilarious stories from his own life as a black man in America. He talks about growing up in a multi-cultural community and realizing that he wasn't always welcome, how he quit sports for musical theater (that's where the girls were) to how Jesus barged in uninvited and changed his life forever (it all started with a Triple F.A.T. Goose jacket) to how he ended up at a small Bible college in Santa Cruz because he thought they had a great theater program (they didn't). Throughout his stories, he also seamlessly weaves in lessons about privilege, the legacy of lynching and sharecropping and why you don't cross black mamas. He teaches readers about the history of encoded racism that still undergirds our society today.By turns witty, insightful, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny,  I Take My Coffee Black  paints a portrait of black manhood in America and enlightens, illuminates, and entertains\u2014ultimately building the kind of empathy that might just be the antidote against the racial injustice in our society.

                "For fans of books like Waiter Rant, and all those who have always wondered how the other half lives, comes this heartfelt, laugh-out-loud memoir from a New York City doorman with astute ears and a penchant for storytelling   As an academically gifted Latino kid growing up in the Bronx, Stephen Bruno's family had high aspirations for his future. He attended magnet schools and selective academic programs and was on track to realize his potential. But those dreams were derailed when, much to his Mami's dismay, he followed a girlfriend to Minnesota and a dead-end job. Languishing and unable to get it together, Stephen eventually moved back home. Broke and eager to make a way for himself\u2014and away from the oppressively religious father wreaking havoc on his love life\u2014the affable, easy going, and quick-witted Stephen lands a much-coveted job as a doorman at a high-end building on Park Avenue.  Hilarity and drama soon abound as Stephen learns the dos and don'ts of being a doorman for the rich and famous and witnesses the antics going on behind the front entrance of this swanky building. In Building Material, he shares those entertaining tales and introduces an unforgettable cast of characters\u2014from Puerto Rican and Albanian doormen battling it out for turf to quirky one percenters to slimy sugar daddies to his peers, both friends and frenemies. Throughout, Stephen offers a glimpse into the unfathomable lives of the residents and a sharp portrait of an everyday man wanting more for himself.  Both poignant and laugh-out-loud funny, Building Material is a captivating true tale of class, failure, and redemption\u2014and how to come back swinging\u2014from a gifted young talent. "

'Part memoir and part masterclass in finding hope and joy in the face of unthinkable challenges. This isn't a book about cancer, it's a book about living'  \u2013 Jaquie Brown   Dai Henwood wanted to be a comedian even before he knew what a comedian was. He always knew there was something special in being able to make people laugh.  Over a 25-year career, the much-loved Kiwi entertainer and TV host has won every major comedy award in New Zealand. But in January 2023, Dai shared publicly that three years earlier he had been diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer.   Perhaps the ultimate teacher for what really matters, Dai's incurable cancer has shown him a new way of living that embraces small moments of perfection and cherishes things we often overlook.   As well as showing us how laughter can be a wonderful medicine \u2013 and there are many laughs in his book \u2013 Dai teaches us that often the gifts we've been searching for are right in front of us, if only we could see them.

I loved this and you will, too.\u201d\u2014Mindy Kaling, author of  Why Not Me?  and  Nothing Like I Imagined   What to do when you\u2019re the perpetual new kid, only child, and military brat hustling school to school each year and everyone\u2019s looking to you for answers? Make some shit up, of course!\u00a0And a young Jay Ellis does just that, with help from his imaginary friend, Mikey. A testament to the importance of invention, trusting oneself, and making space for creativity,  Did Everyone Have an Imaginary Friend (or Just Me)?  is a memoir of a kid who confided in his imaginary sidekick to navigate parallel pop culture universes (like watching  Fresh Prince  alongside John Hughes movies or listening to Ja Rule and Dave Matthews) to a lifetime of birthday disappointment (being a Christmas-season Capricorn will do that to you) and hoop dreams gone bad. Mikey also guides Ellis through tragedies, like losing his teenage cousin in a mistaken-target drive-by and the shame and fear of being pulled over by cops almost a dozen times the year he got his driver\u2019s license. As his imaginary friend morphs into adult consciousness,\u00a0Ellis charts an unforgettable story of looking inward to solve to some of life\u2019s biggest (and smallest) challenges, told in the roast-you-with-love voice of your closest homey.

Is she talking fondly of dictators? Has she suddenly started quietly muttering in the Aldi queue about the \"Jewish Space Lasers\" she's heard are setting wildfires around the world to make sure everyone believes in climate change? When was the moment the world began to believe anything?  Danny Wallace, million-copy bestselling author of  Yes Man  and  Join Me , has fallen down the modern rabbit hole of lies, conspiracies and disinformation. Along the way, he encounters families torn apart by accusations and fake news, journalists putting themselves on the frontline of the disinformation war, reformed conspiracy theorists, influencers who see profit in stoking paranoia, and the shadowy nameless, faceless trolls on the other side of our screens. He discovers how disinformation and well-told lies can ruin a year or a whole life, how they can affect our family, our street, our community. How they can spread across a country, a continent, even the world. How they take hold of our imaginations and make us feel both helpless and powerful. And Danny asks: can you do anything to stop it \u2013 even with the truth on your side? \u00a92024 Danny Wallace (P)2024 Penguin Audio. "

Subjects include \"Why is New York the greatest city in the world?,\" \"Where should I live?,\" \"Where do you find peace and quiet when you feel overwhelmed?,\" and \"Who do I have to give up my subway seat to?\" Part philosophy, part anecdote collection, and part no-nonsense guide,  Ask a Native New Yorker  will become the default gift for transplants to New York, whether they're here for internships, college, or starting a new job.

                "Twenty years ago, Joel Salatin wrote  You Can Farm , which has launched thousands of farm entrepreneurs around the world. With another 20 years of experience under his belt, bringing him to the half-century mark as a full-time farmer, he decided to build on that foundation with a sequel, a graduate level curriculum.   Everyone who reads (or listens to), and enjoys that previous work, will benefit from this additional information. In those 20 years, Polyface Farm progressed from a small family operation to a 20-person, 6,000-customer, 50-restaurant business, all without sales targets, government grants, or an off-farm nest egg.   As a germination tray for new farmers ready to take over the 50 percent of America's agricultural equity that will become available over the next two decades, Polyface Farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley stands as a beacon of hope in a food and farming system floundering in dysfunction: toxicity, pathogenicity, nutrient deficiency, bankruptcy, geezers, and erosion. Speaking into that fear and confusion, Salatin offers a pathway to success, with production, profit, and pleasure thrown in for good measure. This audio edition is wonderfully narrated by the author. Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont.  \u00a92017 Joel Salatin (P) "

But the systems were never truly dismantled in our country, leaving artifacts of injustice that continue to affect every aspect of life for Black and Brown Americans. \u00a0 Many of us feel overwhelmed by the problem, unsure how we can make a difference. Yet God calls the church to stand firmly committed to racial reconciliation\u2014and for each one of us to make choices that lead to healing. \u00a0 In  Brown Faces, White Spaces,  Latasha Morrison\u2014a speaker, bridge builder, and champion for unity\u2014explores nine aspects of American life where systemic racism still flourishes, including education, healthcare, the justice system, entertainment, and the church. Through story, historical context, and present realities, Morrison looks at what it means to recognize and confess the truth about inequities in the system (preparation), commit ourselves to changing the system (dedication), and move into true freedom as a society (liberation).\u00a0 \u00a0 Drawing on rich sociological insights, as well as experiences of family and friends and from her own life, Morrison asks:  How does knowing our country\u2019s history make a difference in how we live today? How does Jesus\u2019s divine act of reconciliation on the cross lead to human liberation from oppression? How might we create systems for all to flourish?  \u00a0 This honest, hope-filled book shows us how we can reform historically white spaces and create systems that work for the good of all. Join the bridge-building movement that is listening, learning, and working together for equity in every aspect of our lives.  Includes questions for personal reflection and group discussion. "

Challenging. Brave. Devastating. Hopeful.\" \u2014Rabbi Sharon Brous, IKAR, author of  The Amen Effect     A deeply insightful exploration of how to live with wisdom, resilience and love in our turbulent times  For the last quarter-century, author and activist Brian D. McLaren has been writing at the intersection of religious faith and contemporary culture. In  Life After Doom,  he engages with the catastrophic failure of both our religious and political leaders to address the dominant realities of our time: ecological overshoot, economic injustice, and the increasing likelihood of civilizational collapse. McLaren defines doom as the \"un-peaceful, uneasy, unwanted feeling\" that \"we humans have made a mess of our civilization and our planet, and not enough of us seem to care enough to change deeply enough or quickly enough to save ourselves.\" Blending insights from philosophers, poets, scientists, and theologians,  Life After Doom  explores the complexity of hope, the necessity of grief, and the need for new ways of thinking, becoming, and belonging in turbulent times. If you want to help yourself, your family, and the communities to which you belong to find courage and resilience for the deeply challenging times that are upon us \u2014 this is the book you need right now.

[a] bracing memoir.\u201d \u2014Kirkus Review    \u201cImportant. Riveting. Unforgettable . . . a profoundly captivating story that can profoundly change your own story.\u201d\u2014Ann Voskamp,  New York Times  bestselling author of  WayMaker   Born White in the heart of Zululand during the racial apartheid, Lisa-Jo Baker longed to write a new future for her children\u2014a longing that set her on a journey to understand where she fit into a story of violence and faith, history and race. Before marriage and motherhood, she came to the United States to study to become a human rights advocate. When she na\u00efvely walked right into America\u2019s own turbulent racial landscape, Baker experienced the kind of painful awakening that is both individual and universal, personal and social. Yet years would go by before she traced this American trauma back to her own South African past. Baker was a teenager when her mother died of cancer, leaving her with her father. Though they shared a language of faith and justice, she often feared him, unaware that his fierce temper had deep roots in a family\u2019s and a nation\u2019s pain. Decades later, old wounds reopened when she found herself spiraling into a terrifying version of her father, screaming herself hoarse at her son. Only then did Baker realize that to go forward\u2014to refuse to repeat the sins of our fathers\u2014we must first go back. With a story that stretches from South Africa\u2019s outback to Washington, D.C.,  It Wasn\u2019t Roaring, It Was Weeping  is a courageous look at inherited hurts and prejudices, and a hope-filled example for all who feel lost in life or worried that they\u2019re too off course to make the necessary corrections. Baker\u2019s story shows that it\u2019s never too late to be free. "

Waiting in the emergency room at Temple University Hospital in North Philadelphia where his eighteen-year-old nephew, Nasir, lay unconscious after being shot nine times, MK Asante began pouring his heart and soul into a series of letters to a beautiful, dying Black boy so full of life.  As Nasir fought for survival, MK realized there was so much\u2014too much\u2014that he had kept from his nephew, starting with the truth about his father, MK's brother, Uzi, whom Nasir had never met. MK could no longer remain silent because in many ways, his nephew was repeating the mistakes of the past. MK began his confessional to repair family bonds\u2014to save Nasir from the same streets that stole his father and to introduce him to the man and family history the young man had never known. The result is this beautiful, poignant, and honest family memoir.  Nephew introduces us to two men, strangers to each other, whose similarities are astonishing. Both have red hot tempers, both struggle with opioid addiction, and most profoundly, both are lyrical geniuses whose raps are raw, powerful, and autobiographical. Yet neither had ever heard the other's lyrics. As he tells his family's story, MK draws vivid portraits of both Nasir and Uzi through their songs\u2014lyrics that become the touchstone of their relationship. When father and son eventually meet, they confront each other and share a dialogue through their lyrics.  An explosive, innovative memoir of family, faith, poetry, secrets, love, race, poverty, redemption, addiction, Philadelphia, hip-hop, jail, purpose, mental health, and violence. Nephew is fast-paced, intimate, lyrical, educational, and inspirational. It is the epic, painful, poetic, and miraculous redemptive story of a new generation\u2014a new style of memoir for a new decade, the rhythmic story of a family in love, struggle, and verse. "

Paul Scheer has entertained countless fans and podcast listeners with stories about the odd, wild, and absurd details of his life. Yet these tales have pointed to deeper, more difficult truths that the actor and comedian has kept to himself. Now, he is finally ready to share those truths for the first time\u2014but, of course, with a healthy dose of humor.  Blending the confident, affable voice that has won him a dedicated following with a refreshing level of candor, Joyful Recollections of Trauma chronicles Paul's often shocking, admittedly tumultuous childhood and how the experiences of his youth have reverberated throughout his life. In his comedy, Paul has always been unafraid to \"go there,\" to play na\u00efve, cringeworthy characters, imbuing them with disarming charm and humanity. That daring openness is on display in the pages of this memoir, but in true Paul fashion, it is also surprising, eye-opening, and side-splitting.  In this madcap journey through the inner working of his mind and creative process, Paul Scheer demonstrates once again that the truth is often stranger\u2014and funnier\u2014than fiction. Joyful Recollections of Trauma offers a unique perspective on universal themes: growing up, working through a challenging childhood, staying true to yourself, and finding success, fulfillment, and happiness in often strange and difficult circumstances. Throughout, Paul shares both the hard-fought lessons and the laughter that can be found in the darkest parts of life, and reminds us that what matters is not what you've been through but who you are becoming. If you loved recent memoirs by Molly Shannon, Maria Bamford, RuPaul, and Jennette McCurdy\u2014or any book that moves you to both laughter and tears\u2014Joyful Recollections of Trauma is the perfect read for you.

No one has, not in many, many years. They used to be everywhere. You couldn't walk out of your front door in New York City in the 1930s without seeing dozens of those little guys scurrying around. Today, there are millions of grown up pigeons in New York, but not a baby pigeon to be seen. That's because they come out of the factory as adults. This is one of the many smoking guns of the bird drone surveillance crisis. Since 1959, the Deep State has mercilessly slaughtered over 12 billion birds and replaced them with identical drones that are designed to spy on private citizens and report their every action directly to the government. From pet canaries to  Sesame Street , the shadowy figures that pull the strings have infiltrated every aspect of our society, making a mockery of civil liberties while the American people live in blissful ignorance. Until now. In  Birds Aren't Real , whistleblowers Peter McIndoe and Connor Gaydos trace the roots of a political conspiracy so vast and well-hidden that it almost seems like an elaborate hoax. These hero Bird Truthers have risked life and limb to compile and disseminate a treasure trove of information about the origins of the surveillance crisis, its spread, and the patriots who are on the front lines today, raising awareness and working to reclaim America as the land of the free. This urgent manifesto features a host of useful illustrations, activities, and leaked classified documents that will convince even the most outspoken skeptic that birds aren't real. The truth is out there: will you stand and fight before it's too late?  A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press. "

We all want to live godly lives and navigate through the issues that arise with confidence, but so often we find ourselves wrestling with conflicting thoughts and feelings. I want to be a good daughter, but I can't trust my parent. I should pray more, but I'm frustrated with God. Instead of naming these thoughts and working through them, we try to force ourselves to act based on what we've been told. But this inevitably ends with us feeling stuck, trapped between the people we think we should be and the way we really feel.  What if this sidelining of our own thoughts and feelings is what's keeping us stuck? Building on psychological and spiritual insight, Dr. Alison Cook guides us through a practical strategy for acknowledging the tension and seeing the fuller truth. She shows us how to . . .  uncover the mixed emotions that keep us confused;  distinguish fact from fiction in our relationships;  make decisions that account for the entirety of a situation; and  start getting honest with ourselves, God, and other people.     As we learn to take a step back from our mixed emotions and see the fuller picture of the challenges we face, we stop feeling paralyzed and start seeing our way through the haze, moving forward with clarity and confidence.

Drawing on Scripture, story, and cutting-edge research into human behavior, pastor Craig Groeschel reveals the key to making the choices we want to make and experiencing the joy and freedom God has for us.   We all want to make great decisions. So what happens between our good intentions and the choices we actually make in the moment? If only we could make decisions ahead of time rather than when we're under stress, overwhelmed, or swayed by fear or emotion. In Think Ahead, we learn how to do just that.  Pastor Craig Groeschel knows from personal experience and as a counselor to others what being trapped in a cycle of poor decision-making is like. In Think Ahead, he shares what he has discovered about the power of \"pre-deciding.\"  With thought-provoking exercises and questions for reflection, this interactive book teaches us that the quality of our decisions determines the quality of our lives. Think Ahead will help you:  Understand the science behind your decision-making habits  Overcome decision fatigue and debilitating fears  Diminish the role of emotions in decision-making  See how your small choices shape the kind of person you become  Define and put into action the seven life-defining pre-decisions you can make today     Becoming the person you want to be starts before you even make a decision. In Think Ahead, you'll discover the power of making decisions today to help you live the life you want to have tomorrow. "

                "Scientist, physician, and pastor Stephen Ko explains how to live and worship incarnationally and glorify God with our bodies.   Many of us don't see much connection between spiritual and physical health. We say grace before digging into greasy, fatty meals we know are bad for us. We read Scripture on our phones before switching to social media feeds that hijack the neural circuitry in our brains. Or we take our physical health too seriously, distancing ourselves from the sick and the needy whom Jesus embraced.  On his journey from pediatrician to public health officer for the CDC to senior pastor of the largest New York Chinese Alliance Church, Stephen Ko has seen that these divisions between physical and spiritual health are artificial. In Faith Embodied, he reminds us that our \"bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit\" (1 Corinthians 6:19). Christ incarnate is deity in flesh, and His spirit is incarnate in us. Living and worshiping incarnationally is consciously embracing what the Creator has designed in His image, from the finest, microscopic details to vital organs within our body, enabling the Holy Spirit to work in us.  Faith Embodied will teach you to:  Understand subconscious ways that thwart the design of the Creator.  Embrace choices that invite incarnational health, living, and worship.  Experience God in every aspect of your life, from flesh and bone to heart and soul.  View the five senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste) in a different light  Reflect the image of God in the way you breathe, move, create, love, and rest.  Weaving together insights from faith, science, and medicine, Ko reveals the marvelous ways in which our physical and spiritual health can prepare us to become instruments of God's healing in the world.

Through focused alone time and question-driven journaling, Terri Savelle Foy will guide readers to discover how God has equipped them for purpose, hope, and success.   \"It's not one two-hour workout that shapes your body, it's twenty minutes of exercise daily.\" In The Alone Advantage, Terri Savelle Foy will show readers how a simple twenty-minute habit of listening to God can shape an entire life. Through practical steps and biblical truths, Terri will guide readers into action and help them learn the habits of successful people and how to do everything from cleaning up to waking up and writing their goals to becoming their own cheerleader in life.  Terri knows what it's like to live in a rut with no vision or goals for her life. For eleven years she existed on autopilot, repeating the same routine with no significant progress. Then she started carving out alone time, picked up a journal, and saw her life transform by applying the ten things successful people do behind closed doors. Now, Terri will prove how the greatest ideas can come in seclusion, strength will be found in solitude, and purpose will be discovered in privacy when nobody is around. Readers will  learn how to achieve success by starting with alone time, writing big questions to God;  discover why and how seclusion, even for just twenty minutes, yields great insight; and  understand the power of imagination to visualize and record dreams for the future.     The Alone Advantage reveals the five reasons successful people journal and how to mold a big dream into a daily to-do list that will inspire action. The key is a blank sheet of paper, time alone with God, and seeking his plan for your life. Through recording God's revelations and learning to listen, readers will see their doubts and anxiety about the future turn into hope and confidence! God has equipped each person with a unique passion, talent, and vision\u2014all it takes to put those in motion is twenty minutes of daily alone time with him. "

Let Katherine Wolf lead you in finding the hope God has for you in your most painful places.   In our lowest, most difficult moments, it's often impossible to see any good thing around us. We suffer, we struggle, we grow weary. We wonder, Is God at work in my life? Is he near me? Is there any point to my suffering and any hope for change?  Though it's easy for our overwhelming pain to cloud our view of reality, the truth is that, even though we can't see it or feel it, God is at work in the darkness. Our Creator is in the business of bringing dead\u2014and nearly dead\u2014things to life.  Even now, no matter how fresh your wounds might be, he invites you to unearth his hidden treasures in your hurting, to reframe your darkness as a sacred space in which the light of hope can shine most brilliantly. Come join Katherine Wolf as she vulnerably shares her own places of wounding and the life-changing insights she has found there. Treasures in the Dark will guide you as you  find grace for the heartbreak of unmet expectations;  explore the surprising intersection of pain and purpose;  wholeheartedly embrace the life you never imagined living with perseverance and joy; and  recognize how your healing can be a part of the world's healing.     With her vibrant faith and unique perspective on life as a stroke survivor and person living with significant disabilities, Katherine will inspire, encourage, and strengthen tender and hurting hearts.

                "Brought to you by Penguin.   Hello there, come on in.   Firstly, I know what you're thinking, 'I'm not religious so I'm not sure if this is for me' but, the truth is, we can all benefit from having a little faith and it will look different to each of us. Granted, some of the stories   about a man who can walk on water and come back from the dead are anything but normal, but the point isn't about what we believe in, it's about believing in something. It's what humans have always done, it's in our DNA, because having faith in something makes us feel connected. It makes us feel like we matter. Faith means we are in it together, that we believe we will be OK.   So, yes, this book is about faith, but it's also about being human, because believing in things is just part of our existence. So, wherever you sit on the faith spectrum, I'm here to tell you it's okay. You don't have to sign up to all of something to get something out of some of it. You don't have to like every song on the album.   My belief has guided me through life's ups and downs, and I hope that sharing what I've learned will help you face your own challenges armed with hope, and plenty of lasagne.

This book is a call to manhood as designed by God. Masculinity is not only needed but necessary for a healthy home and society. James W. Bradford reflects upon the lessons he has learned from his life as he intricately weaves God's word into the messages. Through his unique storytelling, he calls men to rise up and assume their role as leaders in their families. "

                "Donna Freitas wants to believe.   Raised Catholic, she sang songs about Jesus as a child and lived in a house where nuns and priests were regular guests, yet she found herself questioning the faith of her family, examining the reasons none of it added up, and distancing herself from the God of Christianity.    Despite her questions\u2014or perhaps because of them\u2014she made a career out of trying to understand God, pursuing a PhD in religion. But even as she taught college students about mystics, theologians, and others who wrestled with God, she was never able to embrace a faith of her own.    In this searingly honest and deeply personal book, Freitas retraces her roundabout path up and out of the wilderness toward hope, and her dogged\u2014and ongoing\u2014search for faith. She talks about her experience with the Catholic abuse scandal, about being embraced as a speaker at evangelical colleges, about how the death of her mother and the loss of her marriage made her question everything she thought she knew about love, how she cannot reconcile the ways the concept of God makes absolutely no sense, and how she cannot stop trying to believe, despite it all.    Real, raw, and beautifully written,  Wishful Thinking  is a powerful story about the author's search for belief in God and about finding God in the most unexpected places. "

                "\"\"Very good writers have an ability to make you understand what they're feeling. But the very best writers have an ability to make you understand what you're feeling. And that's where Michael Arceneaux sits, and that's what he does in this new book. It's like he's crawling around inside your head opening file cabinets and telling you what the gibberish you've scribbled on each page in each file means. What a great, fun read.\"\"\u2014  Shea Serrano, #1 New York Times bestselling author    New York Times bestselling author Michael Arceneaux returns with a hilarious collection of essays about making your voice heard in an increasingly noisy and chaotic world.   In his books I Can't Date Jesus and I Don't Want to Die Poor, Michael Arceneaux established himself as one of the most beloved and entertaining writers of his generation, touching upon such hot-button topics as race, class, sexuality, labor, debt, and, of course, paying homage to the power and wisdom of Beyonc\u00e9. In this collection, Arceneaux takes stock of how far he has traveled\u2014and how much ground he still has to cover in this patriarchal, heteronormative society. He explores the opportunities afforded to Black creatives but also the doors that remain shut or ever-so-slightly ajar; the confounding challenges of dating in a time when social media has made everything both more accessible and more unreliable; and the allure of returning home while still pushing yourself to seek opportunity elsewhere.  I Finally Bought Some Jordans is both a corrective to, and a balm for, these troubling times, revealing a sharply funny and keen-eyed storyteller working at the height of his craft. "
