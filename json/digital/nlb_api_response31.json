British pantomime draws audiences into the story, an engagement with the hero, and an empathetic attachment to the success of the quest. Attention is held by the familiarity of the event, and the comedians draw the audience into a relationship of complicity as they unite to create the unique experience of the live interactive performance. At other times the audience is diverted by the artif. "

                "A  NEW YORK TIMES ,  LOS ANGELES TIMES ,  USA TODAY  BESTSELLER     The life and legacy of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, wife of John F. Kennedy Jr., are reexamined in this captivating and effervescent biography that is perfect for fans of  My Travels with Mrs. Kennedy ,  What Remains , and  Fairy Tale Interrupted .  A quarter of a century after the plane crash that claimed the lives of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn, and her sister Lauren, the magnitude of this tragedy remains fresh. Yet, Carolyn is still an enigmatic figure, a woman whose short life in the spotlight was besieged with misogyny and cruelty.    Amidst today's cultural reckoning about the way our media treats women, Elizabeth Beller explores the real person behind the tabloid headlines and media frenzy. When she began dating America's prince, Carolyn was increasingly thrust into an overwhelming spotlight filled with relentless paparazzi who reacted to her reserve with a campaign of harassment and vilification.    To this day, she is still depicted as a privileged princess\u2014icy, vapid, and drug-addicted. She has even been accused of being responsible for their untimely death, allegedly delaying take-off until she finished her pedicure. But now, she is revealed as never before.    A fiercely independent woman devoted to her adopted city and career, Carolyn relied on her impeccable eye and drive to fly up the ranks at Calvin Klein in the glossy, high-stakes fashion world of the 1990s. When Carolyn met her future husband, John was immediately drawn to her strong-willed personality, effortless charm, and high intelligence. Their relationship would change her life and catapult her to dizzying fame, but it was her vibrant life before their marriage and then hidden afterwards, that is truly fascinating.    Based on in-depth research and exclusive interviews with friends, family members, teachers, roommates, and colleagues, and featuring never-before-seen family photos, this comprehensive biography reveals a multi-faceted woman worthy of our attention regardless of her husband and untimely death.

At Doubleday's Paris office in 1949, twenty-five-year-old Judith Jones spent most of her time wading through manuscripts in the slush pile and passing on projects\u2014until one day, a book caught her eye. She read it in one sitting, then begged her boss to consider publishing it. A year later,  Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl  became a bestseller. It was the start of a culture-defining career in publishing.    During her more than fifty years as an editor at Alfred A. Knopf, Jones nurtured the careers of literary icons such as Sylvia Plath, Anne Tyler, and John Updike, and helped launched new genres and trends in literature. At the forefront of the cookbook revolution, she published the who's who of food writing: Edna Lewis, M.F.K. Fisher, Claudia Roden, Madhur Jaffrey, James Beard, and, most famously, Julia Child. Through her tenacious work behind the scenes, Jones helped turn these authors into household names, changing cultural mores and expectations along the way.    Judith's work spanned decades of America's most dramatic cultural change\u2014from the end of World War II through the civil rights movement and the fight for women's equality\u2014and the books she published acted as tools of quiet resistance. Now, based on exclusive interviews, never-before-seen personal papers, and years of research, her astonishing career is explored for the first time in this \"thorough and humanizing portrait\" ( Kirkus Reviews ).

Barbara Walters was a force from the time TV was exploding on the American scene in the 1960s to its waning dominance in a new world of competition from streaming services and social media half a century later. She was not just a groundbreaker for women (Oprah announced when she was seventeen that she wanted to be Barbara Walters), but also expanded the big TV interview and then dominated the genre. By the end of her career, she had interviewed more of the famous and infamous, from presidents to movie stars to criminals to despots, than any other journalist in history. Then at sixty-seven, past the age many female broadcasters found themselves involuntarily retired, she pioneered a new form of talk TV called  The View.  She is on the short list of those who have left the biggest imprints on television news and on our culture, male or female. So, who was the woman behind the legacy?   In  The Rulebreaker , Susan Page conducts 150 interviews and extensive archival research to discover that Walters was driven to keep herself and her family afloat after her mercurial and famous impresario father attempted suicide. But she never lost the fear of an impending catastrophe, which is what led her to ask for things no woman had ever asked for before, to ignore the rules of misogynistic culture, to outcompete her most ferocious competitors, and to protect her complicated marriages and love life from scrutiny.   Page breaks news on every front\u2014from the daring things Walters did to become the woman who reinvented the TV interview to the secrets she kept until her death. This is the eye-opening account of the woman who knew she had to break all the rules so she could break all the rules about what viewers deserved to know. "

An old fisherman, James 'Duggie' Carter, performed 'The Captain's Apprentice', a brutal tale of torture sung to the most beautiful tune the young composer had ever heard. With this transformational moment at its heart, the book traces the contrasting lives of the well-to-do composer and a forgotten cabin boy who died at sea, and brings fresh perspectives on folk-song collectors, the singers and their songs.  ***AS READ ON BBC RADIO 4***   'A quirky, fascinating read.

                "An artful and contemplative tribute to the late actor famed for his role as Dylan McKay in  Beverly Hills, 90210 .     Best known for playing loner rebel Dylan McKay in  Beverly Hills 90210 , Luke Perry was fifty-two years old when he died of a stroke in 2019. There have been other deaths of 90's stars, but this one hit different. Gen X was reminded of their own inescapable mortality, and robbed of an exciting career resurgence for one of their most cherished icons\u2014with recent roles in the hit series  Riverdale  and Quentin Tarantino's  Once Upon a Time In Hollywood  bringing him renewed attention and acclaim. Only upon his death, as stories poured out online about his authenticity and kindness, did it become clear how little was known about the exceedingly humble actor and how deeply he impacted popular culture.   In  A Good Bad Boy , Margaret Wappler attempts to understand who Perry was and why he was unique among his Hollywood peers. To do so, she uses an inventive hybrid narrative. She speaks with dozens who knew Perry personally and professionally. They share insightful anecdotes: how he kept connected to his Ohio upbringing; nearly blew his  90210  audition; tried to shed his heartthrob image by joining the HBO prison drama  Oz ; and in the last year of his life, sought to set up two of his newly divorced friends. (After his death, the pair bonded in their grief and eventually married.) Amid these original interviews and exhaustive archival research, Wappler weaves poignant vignettes of memoir in which she serves as an avatar to show how Perry shaped a generation's views on masculinity, privilege, and the ideal of \"cool.\"   Timed to the fifth anniversary of Perry's death,  A Good Bad Boy  is a profound and entertaining examination of what it means to be an artist and an adult.

The industry was firing on all cylinders and growing exponentially; CD was king and bringing in phenomenal sums of money. The good times, culturally and financially, were rolling. Yet by December 1999, at the dawn of the new millennium, a bomb had been set squarely under the core business \u2013 the arrival of digital as we know it today. The story of 1999 is one of control: who had it, who lost it and who wanted more. It was a year of chaos for an industry that had shaped the 20th century, had grown complacent and was quickly having to adapt to a very different and an infinitely less certain future. It was one of the most pivotal, lucrative, exciting and turbulent years the record business has ever experienced. And this is how it happened. "

Told through the lives of the two men who helped shape it: Sir David Barclay and Sir Frederick Barclay.   You May Never See Us Again  is the only definitive story of David and Frederick Barclay - commonly known as the Barclay brothers. Born poor, these enigmatic twins built one of the biggest fortunes in Britain together from scratch and spent six decades at the epicentre of British business, media and politics. Their empire, said to be worth \u00a37bn at its height, included Littlewoods, the Ritz Hotel, The Daily Telegraph and the channel island of Brecqhou. They were major advocates for Brexit and well-connected with influential politicians including Margaret Thatcher, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. And yet despite their fortune and influence, their fiercely guarded desire for privacy has meant that their story remained largely unknown - until a very public family dispute pitched Barclay against Barclay in the High Court. Journalist Jane Martinson unravels the fascinating story of these once inseparable billionaire brothers. Through their lives she offers compelling insights into post-war Britain, from the conditions that enabled their way of doing business to thrive through to the tightly enmeshed webs of influence between capitalism, politics and the media that shape Britain today.

Here she reveals her behind the scenes secrets; inviting us to share in her triumphs, disasters, and backstage shenanigans, all brightened by her mischievous sense of humour and striking honesty.

What went wrong?  Australian magazines once boasted the highest circulation per capita in the world. Former magazine editor Phil Barker follows the story from this golden age to today, showing how mismanagement, unchecked spending and the challenge presented by the rise of the internet all combined to undermine the previously unassailable position magazines held in the Australian consciousness. Prominent magazine executives and editors who witnessed the industry's decline and failure to capitalise on digital opportunities have gone on the record for the first time. Featuring in-depth analysis of archival reporting and brand-new interviews with key players,  Axed  lifts the lid on the scandals behind the industry's swan dive. But Phil also talks to the people who have managed to pivot in a fast-moving media landscape and believe magazines are a part of Australia's future. Are magazines really dead, or is there still some hope for survival?. "

Long periods of writer's block are followed by sudden bursts of creativity that produce some of the best work of his career, including perhaps his most celebrated album, 1975's  Blood On The Tracks . There is the unpredictable recording process, with Dylan often including on his albums the worst takes and leaving off the best songs altogether. On the Neverending Tour he reinvents his songbook on a nightly basis, at times without recognition. Then there are the albums and songs that reveal the genius of an artist whose lyrics draw on centuries of American culture but who refuses to be shackled to his own past. Today his voice is almost unrecognisable from his 1960s peak, and the man whose songs had been devoted to dissecting his romantic relationships has become focused on mortality, solitude and getting old. Yet his albums continue to top the charts, 2020's  Rough And Rowdy Ways  being his fourth No. 1 album of the twenty-first century. There is no other living artist whose creative output has remained constantly intriguing, often baffling, sometimes infuriating but always fascinating for over sixty years. Clinton Heylin's definitive, scrupulously researched and revelatory life, based on unprecedented access to the official Tulsa archive and other new sources, paints the fullest and brightest portrait yet of an iconic figure that has defined contemporary culture.

                "'Gratitude is your soul's superfood, but cheaper than goji berries, and twice as good for you. I like to think of it as mindfulness for cynics or the \"gateway drug\" to spirituality. It's a very tangible thing you can do everyday that will shift your focus to what you have rather than pining and obsessing over what you don't have. Away from a state of lack into limitless abundance...'  So what happens when we stop taking things for granted and start putting some gr\u00e1* into our gratitude? When we consciously turn our heads and hearts to what we have and focus on the good? In Joy Rider, television presenter and host of the podcast  Thanks A Million , Angela Scanlon, presents her guide to tapping into your own natural super resource - joy.  This book is an invitation to embrace the kind of gratitude that cuts through the bulls**t of life to its truth, connecting us with the present and grounding us in self. When there is so much to feel anxious about, Angela shares with readers how focusing our attention on the small, incremental positives in life can completely change it for the better.  * It means love in Irish.

                "A fresh portrait of the man behind James Bond, and his enduring impact, by an award-winning biographer with unprecedented access to the Fleming family papers.  Ian Fleming's greatest creation, James Bond, has had an enormous and ongoing impact on our culture. What Bond represents about ideas of masculinity, the British national psyche and global politics has shifted over time, as has the interpretation of the life of his author. But Fleming himself was more mysterious and subtle than anything he wrote. Ian's childhood with his gifted brother Peter and his extraordinary mother set the pattern for his ambition to be 'the complete man', and he would strive for the means to achieve this 'completeness' all his life. Only a thriller writer for his last twelve years, his dramatic personal life and impressive career in Naval Intelligence put him at the heart of critical moments in world history, while also providing rich inspiration for his fiction. Nicholas Shakespeare is one of the most gifted biographers working today. His talent for uncovering new material that casts fresh light on his subjects is fully evident in this masterful, definitive biography.  'This is a marvellous book about Ian Fleming, but it's also one of the most engaging portraits of a particular period of British history that I have read in a long time.' Antonia Fraser   'A book so buoyant and delicious that you feel it will be a friend for life.'  Telegraph    *A  The Times ,  Financial Times ,  Economist ,  Spectator  and  BBC History Magazine  Book of the Year*. "

Completing fifty years as a professional singer in 2020 was just another milestone in her fabled career. In this vivid biography, which was originally written in Hindi, Vikas Kumar Jha captures the entire arc of Uthup's career in music. From her childhood days in Mumbai and her first gigs singing with jazz bands in Chennai's glitzy nightclubs to her meteoric rise as India's musical sensation and her philanthropic work, Jha covers it all and manages to weave a narrative that is colourful, inspiring and bound to keep any reader engrossed till the end. Uthup is known for such evergreen hits as 'Hari Om Hari', 'Rambha Ho' and 'Jeete Hain Shaan Se', and her voice transcends genres. When she takes the stage, in her elaborately designed sarees and trademark bindis, she embodies a unique liveliness, unparalleled in the realm of Indian music. Jha meticulously explores Uthup's sense of freedom, her struggles, and her constructive and creative attitude towards work and life. This pitch-perfect English translation, by Srishti Jha, offers the reader a front-row seat to the life and times of the inimitable Usha Uthup. "

Full of humour and endless blunders' \u2013  The Times  'What a man, what a life, what a story, and what a great read' \u2013 Paddy   McGuinness   Presenter, commentator, (sometimes masked) singer, footballer, manager and campaigner, Kammy has done it all. His irrepressible enthusiasm \u2013 and a couple of legendary gaffes on Sky Sports \u2013 have seen him become broadcasting royalty.  Now Kammy reveals all in this funny and moving autobiography. What happens when you double cross Jos\u00e9 Mourinho? What it's like to play with Vinnie Jones? Who comes off better: Kammy or a rampaging gorilla? How did Kammy end up releasing his own top-ten record? What's the real story behind his infamous line, 'I don't know, Jeff!'? But despite the crazy tales, it hasn't all been plain sailing. Kammy had a tough upbringing, faced racism during his playing career and has, in recent years, dealt with a rare brain condition \u2013 apraxia \u2013 that has affected his speech and seen him say goodbye to Sky Sports. Relating his battle against the condition, Kammy shows how he's met every challenge with courage, determination and his infectious smile. Packed with hilarious stories and featuring a cast of famous names, from Elton John to Channing Tatum, this is a book about friendship, courage and why it's always important to have a good laugh.  'A talented (and daft) lad from the Boro who has entertained the nation for decades, on and off the pitch. So get the tissues ready \u2013 this book will make you laugh and cry in equal measure' \u2013   Steph McGovern. "

By day he studies; by night he attends parties with Picasso and Cocteau before paying too high a price for success. Richard Hilary, a confident if unprincipled Spitfire pilot, is suffering from terrible burns after being shot down. But the operations to restore him haven't deterred him from returning to action. And Jeremy Wolfenden, the cleverest of his set at All Souls College, leaves it all behind to report on the Cold War. But his louche private life makes him a plaything for the intelligent services, taking him on a fateful journey between East and West.  The Fatal Englishman  is a stunning tale of three short lives that burned brightly from a master storyteller. "

                "The remarkable, must-read story of Charlie Chaplin's years of exile from the United States during the postwar Red Scare, and how it ruined his film career, from bestselling biographer Scott Eyman.  Bestselling Hollywood biographer and film historian Scott Eyman tells the story of Charlie Chaplin's fall from grace. In the aftermath of World War Two, Chaplin was criticized for being politically liberal and internationalist in outlook. He had never become a US citizen, something that would be held against him as xenophobia set in when the postwar Red Scare took hold.   Politics aside, Chaplin had another problem: his sexual interest in young women. He had been married three times and had had numerous affairs. In the 1940s, he was the subject of a paternity suit, which he lost, despite blood tests that proved he was not the father. His sexuality became a convenient way for those who opposed his politics to condemn him. Refused permission to return to the US from a trip abroad, he settled in Switzerland, and made his last two films in London   In  Charlie Chaplin vs. America , bestselling author Scott Eyman explores the life and times of the movie genius who brought us such masterpieces as  City Lights  and  Modern Times . This is a perceptive, insightful portrait of Chaplin and of an America consumed by political turmoil. "

                "Henry Winkler, launched into prominence by his role as 'The Fonz' in the beloved  Happy Days , has transcended the role that made him who he is.  Brilliant, funny, and widely-regarded as the nicest man in Hollywood (though he would be the first to tell you that it's simply not the case, he's really just grateful to be here), Henry shares in this achingly vulnerable memoir the disheartening truth of his childhood, the difficulties of a life with severe dyslexia, the pressures of a role that takes on a life of its own, and the path forward once your wildest dream seems behind you. Since the glorious era of  Happy Days  fame, Henry has endeared himself to a new generation with roles in such adored shows as  Arrested Development ,  Parks and Recreation , and  Barry , where he's revealed himself as an actor with immense depth and pathos, a departure from the period of his life when he was so distinctly typecast as 'The Fonz', he could hardly find work.  Filled with profound heart, charm, and self-deprecating humor,  Being Henry  is a memoir about so much more than a life in Hollywood and the curse of stardom. It is a meaningful testament to the power of sharing truth and kindness and of finding fulfillment within yourself. "

                "Named a Best Book of 2022 by  The New Yorker ,  Publishers Weekly , and NPR      In this genre-defying work of cultural history, the chief film critic of  Slate  places comedy legend and acclaimed filmmaker Buster Keaton's unique creative genius in the context of his time.    Born the same year as the film industry in 1895, Buster Keaton began his career as the child star of a family slapstick act reputed to be the most violent in vaudeville. Beginning in his early twenties, he enjoyed a decade-long stretch as the director, star, stuntman, editor, and all-around mastermind of some of the greatest silent comedies ever made, including  Sherlock Jr .,  The General , and  The Cameraman .   Even through his dark middle years as a severely depressed alcoholic finding work on the margins of show business, Keaton's life had a way of reflecting the changes going on in the world around him. He found success in three different mediums at their creative peak: first vaudeville, then silent film, and finally the experimental early years of television. Over the course of his action-packed seventy years on earth, his life trajectory intersected with those of such influential figures as the escape artist Harry Houdini, the pioneering Black stage comedian Bert Williams, the television legend Lucille Ball, and literary innovators like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Samuel Beckett.   In  Camera Man , film critic Dana Stevens pulls the lens out from Keaton's life and work to look at concurrent developments in entertainment, journalism, law, technology, the political and social status of women, and the popular understanding of addiction. With erudition and sparkling humor, Stevens hopscotches among disciplines to bring us up to the present day, when Keaton's breathtaking (and sometimes life-threatening) stunts remain more popular than ever as they circulate on the internet in the form of viral gifs. Far more than a biography or a work of film history,  Camera Man  is a wide-ranging meditation on modernity that paints a complex portrait of a one-of-a-kind artist. "

As the boxes started to arrive, the Foundation asked Clinton Heylin - author of the acclaimed  Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades  and 'perhaps the world's authority on all things Dylan' ( Rolling Stone ) - to assess the material they had been given. What he found in Tulsa - as well as what he gleaned from other papers he had recently been given access to by Sony and the Dylan office - so changed his understanding of the artist, especially of his creative process, that he became convinced that a whole new biography was needed. It turns out that much of what previous biographers - Dylan himself included - have said is wrong; often as not, a case of, Print the Legend. With fresh and revealing information on every page  A Restless, Hungry Feeling  tells the story of Dylan's meteoric rise to fame: his arrival in early 1961 in New York, where he is embraced by the folk scene; his elevation to spokesman of a generation whose protest songs provide the soundtrack for the burgeoning Civil Rights movement; his alleged betrayal when he 'goes electric' at Newport in 1965; his subsequent controversial world tour with a rock 'n' roll band; and the recording of his three undisputed electric masterpieces:  Bringing it All Back Home ,  Highway 61 Revisited  and  Blonde on Blonde . At the peak of his fame in July 1966 he reportedly crashes his motorbike in Woodstock, upstate New York, and disappears from public view. When he re-emerges, he looks different, his voice sounds different, his songs are different. That other story will be told in Volume 2, to be published in autumn 2022. Clinton Heylin's meticulously researched, all-encompassing and consistently revelatory account of these fascinating early years is the closest we will ever get to a definitive life of an artist who has been the lodestar of popular culture for six decades.

REVEALING. REFLECTIVE. The candid autobiography. Danny Cipriani has always been searching for something. On the pitch, it was a line-break or space. A chink of light to dart through. An angle that no one else could see. Off the pitch, it was seeking a path through the pressure, fame and chaos that came with being anointed the 'Saviour of English Rugby'. Who Am I? is the raw and powerful memoir of a man of mercurial talent who, with the world at his feet, made his England rugby debut aged 20. A man who, just a year later, contemplated suicide. A man whose safe space was on the field, away from the drink, the women and the drugs he turned to in an attempt to escape his thoughts. Now, for the first time, one of the most compelling personalities in the sport reflects on who he was, where he's come from and the man he's become. Alongside his astute insight into playing under Martin Johnson, Stuart Lancaster and Eddie Jones, Danny also talks about chasing his dreams, his desire and passion to represent England, and his drive to become the best player he could be. This is the story of a once complicated man. A man searching for answers. A man trying to understand who he is. "

                "At thirteen years old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a child prodigy who had captured the hearts of northern Europe, but his father Leopold was now determined to conquer Italy. Together, they made three visits there the last when Mozart was seventeen, all vividly recounted here by acclaimed conductor Jane Glover. Father and son travelled from the theatres and concert salons of Milan to the church-filled streets of Rome to Naples, poorer and more dangerous than the prosperous north, and to Venice, the carnivalesque birthplace of public opera. All the while Mozart was absorbing Italian culture, language, style and art, and honed his craft. He met the challenge of writing Italian opera for Italian singers and audiences and provoked a variety of responses, from triumph and admiration to intrigue and hostility: in a way, these Italian years can be seen as a microcosm of his whole life.  Evocative, beautifully written and with a profound understanding of eighteenth-century classical music,  Mozart in Italy  reveals how what he experienced during these Italian journeys changed Mozart \u2013 and his music \u2013 for ever.

In 2000, millions of Australians tuned in to watch  Popstars , one of the world's first reality television competitions, in which five girls were selected from thousands to become members of a new band: Bardot. And Belinda Chapple signed a contract that would turn her life upside down.    Bardot shot straight to fame and Belinda spent the following three years relentlessly rehearsing, recording and touring. The band released two very successful albums, a slew of hit singles, and performed on world stages to thousands of adoring fans.    But Belinda discovered that the life of a popstar could be lonely, and it came with consequences she never saw coming. The impact on her body image was disastrous, and it was impossible to maintain romantic relationships, but at least she had her fellow band members to turn to for support ... or so she thought.   The Girl in the Band  is a behind-the-curtains look at the ruthlessness of the entertainment industry. Belinda Chapple's story will resonate with anyone who's given up everything for a dream, only to have it shatter around them. "

                "In September 1998, Michael J. Fox stunned the world by announcing that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease - in fact, he had been secretly fighting it for seven years. In this candid book, with his trademark ironic sensibility and sense of the absurd, he tells his life story - from his childhood in western Canada to his meteoric rise in film and television and, most importantly, the years in which - with the unswerving support of his wife, family and friends - he has dealt with his illness. He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure and spread public awareness of the disease. He feels as if he is a very lucky man indeed. "

This rapid convergence has been key to the sports business industry's continued growth and financial success.  Money Games  not only analyzes how industry stakeholders have monetized this convergence, but also answers this core question: how can the sports business continue to profit from the blurring of sports and entertainment? Author David M. Carter considers a wide array of implications for television content, video gaming, athlete branding, the Internet, mobile technology, gambling, sports-anchored real estate development, venue technology, and corporate marketing\u2014in short, those areas where business opportunities exist now that sports and entertainment have become one.  \"Fans, sports and media executives, and even investors will find that Carter's examination\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. of the changing landscape of sports and entertainment helps them understand their own experiences.\" \u2014Stephen A.

Milne, one of the most successful English writers ever, and the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh, and of Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore and Christopher Robin.  But the fictional Christopher Robin was based on Milne's own son. This heart-warming and touching book recounts the true story that inspired the film  Goodbye Christopher Robin , directed by Simon Curtis and starring Domhnall Gleeson, Margot Robbie and Kelly Macdonald, and offers the reader a glimpse into the relationship between Milne and the real-life Christopher Robin, whose toys inspired the magical world of the Hundred Acre Wood.  Along with his mother Daphne and his nanny Olive, Christopher Robin and his family were swept up in the international success of the books; the enchanting tales brought hope and comfort to an England ravaged by the First World War. But with the eyes of the world on Christopher Robin, what will the cost be to the family? With a preface by Frank Cottrell-Boyce, co-writer of the screenplay. "

                "An insider's view on blockbuster deal-making and part cultural tour de force,  An Improbable Journey  is a one-of-a-kind, deeply textured account of how some of the greatest artists of all time pushed to realize their greatest ambitions\u2014with the help of Charles Lubar.  The year was 1971. Thirty-year-old Charles Lubar, a Washington, D.C.\u2013born Harvard Law School graduate with a two-and-a-half-year deep dive in the Chief Counsel's Office of the Internal Revenue Service recently behind him, was floundering in Nairobi, Kenya where he had come to seek the kind of high-stakes adventures one could never find at a major law firm in the U.S. But with his entrepreneurial hopes quashed in Nairobi by an environment that hardly wrapped its arms around outsiders, Indians being expelled from Kenya, and Idi Amin\u2014the ruthless despot\u2014on the brink of taking over in neighboring Uganda and soon to wreak havoc throughout the region, Lubar decided to pick up his stakes. With a sense of timing that would come to his aid again and again throughout his life, the young lawyer opted to make his next home in the UK. Little did he know that he would soon be swimming hard and fast in 1970s London during a cultural surge of film, television, music, and the stage.    \"Hired off the street\" by two American lawyers in London\u2014the brassy entertainment lawyer Irwin Margulies and the corporate transactional lawyer Barry Sterling\u2014Lubar could never have predicted that his work would soon put him front and center at some of the biggest moments with some of the biggest names in showbiz. From the James Bond franchise to Linda Lovelace and \"Deep Throat\"; from Jim Henson and The Muppets to Michael Jackson and the Beatles; from behind the Iron Curtain to the islands of the Netherlands Antilles, Lubar's rare knowledge of the tax codes spanning Europe and the U.S. made him an indispensable figure to creatives trying to make their financial lives work on both sides of the Atlantic.    His list of clients goes on and on: Bill Graham, John Cleese, Santana, Diana Ross, Frank Oz, Chuck Traynor, Marilyn Chambers, Barbara Bach, Jane Seymour, Shakira, and Enrique Iglesias. Many turned to Lubar in real need of his assistance at the very prime (and sometimes, nadir) of their careers. Lubar's bona fides would even land him a spot on the US-UK Fulbright Commission, as President of the Yale Club of London, and a Managing Partner in London of one of the major international law firms.  An Improbable Journey  shows a risk-taker with his finger living right on the cultural pulse of a moment. "

                "I n  1940 Sergei Rachmaninoff, living in exile in America, broke his creative silence and composed a swan song to his Russian homeland. What happened in those final haunted years and how did he come to write his farewell masterpiece, the Symphonic Dances? Rachmaninoff left Petrograd in 1917 in the throes of the Russian Revolution. He was 44 years old, at the peak of his powers as composer-conductor-performer, moving in elite Tsarist circles, as well as running the family estate, his refuge and solace. He had already written the music which, today, has made him one of the most popular composers of all time: the second and third Piano Concertos and two symphonies. The story of his years in exile in America and Switzerland, has only been told in passing. Reeling from the trauma of a life in upheaval, he wrote almost no music and quickly had to reinvent himself as a f\u00eated virtuoso pianist, building up untold wealth and meeting the stars- from Walt Disney and Charlie Chaplin to his Russian contemporaries and polar opposites, Prokofiev and Stravinsky. Yet the melancholy of leaving his homeland never lifted. Using a wide range of sources, including important newly translated texts, Maddocks' immensely readable book conjures impressions of this enigmatic figure, his friends and the world he encountered. It explores his life as an emigr\u00e9 artist and how he clung to an Old Russia which no longer existed. That forging of past and present meets in his Symphonic Dances (1940), his last composition, written on Long Island shortly before his death in Beverly Hills, surrounded by a close-knit circle of Russian exiles.

Daughter of the unparalleled Allauddin Khan of Maitra and the first wife of Pandit Ravi Shankar, she conquered the summit of Indian classical music, only to later renounce public life to spend her entire life as a recluse in the confinement of her house. Until the age of sixteen, Annapurna Devi was confined to her family home at Maihar, where her father was a court musician and guru to the maharaja. During this period, she devoted herself exclusively to the deepest study and practice of Indian classical music under the strict tutelage of her father. After her estrangement from her husband Pandit Ravi Shankar, Annapurna Devi went ever deeper into self-imposed seclusion. The only people whom she met and communicated with were her disciples who used to visit her for music lessons, which included some of the greatest musicians our era has seen, including Pandit Nikhil Banerjee, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Ustad Bahadur Khan, Aashish Khan, Dhyanesh Khan, Nityanand Haldipur and Basant Kabra, to name a few. Full of anecdotes and untold stories, this is her life story as told by her to her disciples over a period of time, giving valuable insights into their Guru Ma's personality, music and teachings. "

                "The autobiography of an American icon 'I never think that people die. They just go to department stores'  Andy Warhol - American painter, filmmaker, publisher, actor and major figure in the Pop Art movement - was in many ways a reluctant celebrity. Here, in his autobiography, he spills his secrets and muses about love, sex, food, beauty, fame, work, money, success, New York and America and its place in the world. But it is his reflections on himself, his childhood in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, the explosion of his career in the Sixties and his life among celebrities - from working with Elizabeth Taylor to partying with the Rolling Stones - that give a true insight into the mind of one of the most iconic figures in twentieth-century culture. Andy Warhol (1928-1987), was an American painter, filmmaker, publisher, actor, and a major figure in the Pop Art movement. He also produced a significant body of film work, including the famous  Chelsea Girls ; characterised the epoch with the now-famous expression 'fifteen minutes of fame'; produced the first album by The Velvet Underground; and was nearly killed just two days before the assassination of JFK.

In  Time Come , he selects some of his most powerful prose \u2013 book and record reviews published in newspapers and magazines, lectures, obituaries and speeches \u2013 for the first time. Written over many decades, it is a body of work that draws creatively and critically on Johnson's own Jamaican roots and on Caribbean history to explore the politics of race that continue to inform the Black British experience. Ranging from reflections on the place of music in Caribbean and Black British culture as a creative, defiant response to oppression, to his penetrating appraisals of music and literature, and including warm tributes paid to the activists and artists who inspired him to find his own voice as a poet and compelled him to contribute to the struggle for racial equality and social justice,  Time Come  is a panorama of an exceptional life. A collection that ventures into memoir, it underscores Johnson's enduring importance in Britain's cultural history and reminds us of his brilliant, unparalleled legacy.  With an introduction by Paul Gilroy   'A book to be savoured and re-read'  - Derek Owusu  'An outstanding collection'  - Caryl Phillips  'A necessary book from a writer who continues to inspire'  - Yomi Sode  'Incisive, engaging, fearless'  - Gary Younge.

                "A thrillingly provocative   investigation into the Shakespeare authorship question, exploring how doubting that William Shakespeare wrote his plays became an act of blasphemy...and who the Bard might really be.  The theory that Shakespeare may not have written the works that bear his name is the most horrible, vexed, unspeakable subject in the history of English literature. Scholars admit that the Bard's biography is a \"black hole,\" yet to publicly question the identity of the god of English literature is unacceptable, even (some say) \"immoral.\"   In  Shakespeare Was a Woman and Other Heresies , journalist and literary critic Elizabeth Winkler sets out to probe the origins of this literary taboo. Whisking readers from London to Stratford-upon-Avon to Washington, DC, she pulls back the curtain to show how the forces of nationalism and empire, religion and mythmaking, gender and class have shaped our admiration for Shakespeare across the centuries. As she considers the writers and thinkers\u2014from Walt Whitman to Sigmund Freud to Supreme Court justices\u2014who have grappled with the riddle of the plays' origins, she explores who may perhaps have been hiding behind his name. A forgotten woman? A disgraced aristocrat? A government spy? Hovering over the mystery are Shakespeare's plays themselves, with their love for mistaken identities, disguises, and things never quite being what they seem.   As she interviews scholars and skeptics, Winkler's interest turns to the larger problem of historical truth\u2014and of how human imperfections (bias, blindness, subjectivity) shape our construction of the past. History is a story, and the story we find may depend on the story we're looking for.   An irresistible work of literary detection , Shakespeare Was a Woman and Other Heresies  will forever change how you think of Shakespeare... and of how we as a society decide what's up for debate and what's just nonsense, just heresy.

Following a surge of fake news, clickbait and conspiracy theories, the 2020s have ushered in a welter of existential threats for public service broadcasting. So, where do we go from here? Former Today editor and head of BBC television news Roger Mosey thinks public service broadcasters must buck the trends and in this incisive book he offers twenty core ways in which the news can save itself by getting smarter, sharper, more diverse, more nuanced and less exposed to pummelling by politicians. Mosey sees two possible futures: one in which the incitements of populist demagogues and the passions of social media are ever dominant \u2013 or one where we fight hard to retain media that has an interest in the public good and preserves truth, fairness and evidence-based judgements. From one of British broadcasting's most experienced voices comes the definitive exploration of Britain's news output and what must change if we are to avoid a future of uninspiring news, uninformed decision-making and accountability-dodging politicians.

Uncle Albert\u2019s famous catchphrase \u2018 During The War...\u2019 is relevant to Buster\u2019s own life, as he served as an officer in Africa during the second world war. His reminiscences are amusing, touching and tell of a life quite distant from that as bank manager, director of amateur dramatic productions, father and husband.    Buster broke into the notoriously difficult world of professional acting at a relatively late stage in his life. He offers us his advice on how to succeed in show business and tells us how he made it. A heady mix of luck opportunity, talent, experience, experiment, fearlessness, originality, faith and belief created this much loved figure of British television comedy. "

                "Who is Ridley Scott? The director of Blade Runner, Gladiator, Hannibal and the controversial forthcoming Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley Scott is one of cinema's most accomplished visual stylists.    His films have included the phenomenally successful Blade Runner, a film which flopped in 1982 but has since become a cinematic touchstone for visions of the future, and the fatally flawed Legend, his attempt to create a dark fairy tale, compromised by production problems and studio interference. His cult movies (visceral creature feature Alien, Blade Runner and Legend) are his most talked about films, but Scott branched out to tackle a series of thrillers, before hitting Oscar gold with the controversial feminist road movie, Thelma & Louise.    Acclaimed for the visual depth of his films, Scott has often been criticised for not giving enough attention to his characters or his stories. Attempts to chart history in 1492: Conquest of Paradise and tell a true story in White Squall were not successful, but Scott triumphantly returned to form with Gladiator, his blood-soaked, blockbusting retelling of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire.    So what's in this Pocket Essential? As well as an introductory essay, the making of each of Ridley Scott's visually sumptuous films is chronicled, complete with information on the inspiration for each film and the reaction of critics and audiences. There are also detailed accounts of the Ridley Scott projects which did not make it to the big screen. Not only that, but there's a handy reference section listing other books about Ridley Scott, interesting web sites and availability of his films.    Greatly expanded and fully updated, this new edition of the Pocket Essential Ridley Scott covers everything you need to know about this remarkable filmmaker. "

Fiona Maddocks  'Pioneering.'  Andrew Motion ' Brilliant'  Helen Pankhurst  Ethel Smyth (b.1858):  Famed for her operas, this trailblazing queer Victorian composer was a larger-than-life socialite, intrepid traveller and committed Suffragette.  Rebecca Clarke (b.1886):  This talented violist and Pre-Raphaelite beauty was one of the first women ever hired by a professional orchestra, later celebrated for her modernist experimentation.   Dorothy Howell (b.1898):  A prodigy who shot to fame at the 1919 Proms, her reputation as the 'English Strauss' never dented her modesty; on retirement, she tended Elgar's grave alone.  Doreen Carwithen (b.1922):  One of Britain's first woman film composers who scored Elizabeth II's coronation film, her success hid a 20-year affair with her married composition tutor .  In their time, these women were celebrities. They composed some of the century's most popular music and pioneered creative careers; but today, they are ghostly presences, surviving only as muses and footnotes to male contemporaries like Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten - until now. Leah Broad's magnificent group biography resurrects these forgotten voices, recounting lives of rebellion, heartbreak and ambition, and celebrating their musical masterpieces. Lighting up a panoramic sweep of British history over two World Wars,  Quartet  revolutionises the canon forever. "

                "THE  SUNDAY TIMES  BESTSELLER 'From the heart. It feels so authentic . . . Encompassing and inclusive . . . Reads beautifully and fluidly and feels like having a chat with your best friend' - Elizabeth Day on HOW TO FAIL   'The book is a triumph...an accessible insight into the woman behind the brand'  Grazia  ________________________   Have you ever found yourself in that moment where you just wonder - what's next? I could carry on as I am but there's a yearning for something else. That's where this book started for me...   Presenter. Fashion icon. Wife. Mother. Holly Willoughby lights up the nation's TV screens every day but, like all of us, she has struggled with moments of self-doubt, feelings of guilt, anger and detachment. Here she shares how she has learned to reconnect with herself in order to face her fears head on.  With her trademark warmth, Holly shows how listening to her inner voice and celebrating life's little moments of beauty and joy - like looking up at the moon or finding the perfect red lipstick - helped her feel whole again.    Reflections  is an empathetic, encouraging book that will inspire you to live your most beautiful, authentic life.  WHAT READERS ARE SAYING:  -'I rarely read and read this book in two days! Much of what Holly wrote about resonated with me and I've taken so much practical advice away with me.'  -'Like little snippets of therapy'  -'This book is brilliant. Holly addresses many things that we all face in life and gives her best advice on how to overcome them. Fantastic for anyone but mostly anyone who suffers any kind of anxieties or self consciousness.   -'Amazing . . . Holly is just fabulous and I can't put it down, so nice to know we aren't in this journey alone'    -'So beautifully written and relatable in lots of ways. It will be a book that I am sure I will keep taking off of my book shelf to keep going back to read for a long time' "

                "Have you been dissed by dust? Does the thought of cooking dinner turn your stomach instead of turn you on? Are you uncertain as to which is the functional end of a broom? Have you been told that you're short on housekeeping skills? Well, don't just stand there - get TALL!   Mopping Tall! - The Hubby's Guide to Housework and Other Dangerous Jobs  is just what you need to transform yourself from a domestic doormat into a He-man of Home Management.

'This is a brilliant book by a brilliant man. A magician with perfect taste. Thank God I met him. He is gold dust!'  ELTON JOHN  Leaving school at the age of sixteen to start his career in the music industry at Decca Records, Tony King would soon find himself becoming a close friend and confidante to some of the world's biggest artists - a far cry from his childhood days in Eastbourne.  Living in an era of seismic social, technological and cultural transformation, King experienced these defining moments as an influential figure in London and New York's gay scenes. Despite his heady life in showbusiness, however, he would soon learn that a glittering career couldn't shield him from heartbreak - witness to the AIDS crisis and the devastating consequences, his personal life was intermittently marked by tumult and turmoil. This included spending time with with his friend Freddie Mercury in the Queen frontman's final days. Suffused with Tony King's disarming warmth and unparalleled charisma - and at times profoundly moving -  The Tastemaker  paints an intimate portrait of a music legend and captures the unpredictable world he stamped his indelible mark upon.

Most memoirs give me far more than I want to know - this is the rare sort that left me urgently demanding a second volume, a third, a fourth. I loved it.'  Philip Pullman   Stephen Hough is indisputably one of the world's leading pianists, winning global acclaim and numerous awards. This memoir recounts his unconventional coming-of-age story, from his beginnings in an unmusical home in Cheshireto the main stage of Carnegie Hall in New York aged 21. We read of his early love-affair with the piano which curdled, after a teenage nervous breakdown, into failure at school and six-hours a day watching television, engulfed in dreams, seesawing between sexual and religious obsessions.We meet his supportive, if eccentric parents - his artistically frustrated father, his housework-hating mother. We read of the teachers who encouraged and inspired, and others who hit him on the head screaming, \"you'll do nothing with your life\". Then finding his way back to the piano, having abandoned plans for an alternative life as a Catholic priest, he flourished at the Royal Northern College of Music and the Juilliard School, beginning his career as an international soloist as this book ends.

                "'Swan Dive  is to ballet what Anthony Bourdain's  Kitchen Confidential  was to restaurants, a chance to go behind the serene front of house to the sweaty, foul-mouthed, psychofrenzy backstage.' \u2013 Daisy Goodwin,  Sunday Times   In this love letter to the art of dance, Georgina Pazcoguin, New York City Ballet's first Asian American female soloist, lays bare the backstage world of elite ballet. With an unapologetic sense of humour about the cut-throat mentality required, Pazcoguin takes us from her small home town in Pennsylvania to training for one of the most revered ballet companies in the world \u2013 a company that was rocked by scandal in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Pazcoguin continues to be one of the few dancers openly speaking up against harassment, abuse and racism \u2013 all of which she has painfully experienced firsthand. Tying together Pazcoguin's fight for equality with an infectious passion for her craft,  Swan Dive  is a page-turning, one-of-a-kind memoir that guarantees you'll never view a ballerina or a ballet the same way again.  'Always arresting onstage, Georgina Pazcoguin gives us a take on the ballet world that is witty and from the heart. An eye-opening read.' \u2013 Mikhail Baryshnikov   'A funny, poignant and shocking read . . . [Pazcoguin] punctures, with enormous glee, the stereotype of the ballet dancer as an elegant, ethereal being.' \u2013 Fiona Sturges,  Guardian. "

When Natasha Leggero got pregnant at forty-two after embarking on the grueling IVF process, she was over the moon. But once her feelings of bliss dissipated, she couldn't help but shake the lingering question:  Am I doing this right?  And then,  Should I be doing this if the world is about to end?    In  The World Deserves My Children , Natasha explores themes like \"geriatric\" motherhood, parenting in an environmental panic, fear and love, discipline (and conflicting schools of thought on how not to raise a brat), and more. Ultimately, Natasha determines that motherhood is worth it.  After all,   where do you think the next five generations of humans will be if the only people who are having kids don't believe in science? The world deserves my children. "

Graham grew up as an Army kid, moving frequently in his early years from West Germany to Derbyshire and Winchester before settling in Colchester, Essex. A shy child, he had a thing for eating soil and drawing intense visions; his anxiety was tempered by painting and a growing love of music. These twin passions grew into obsessions, and as he honed his artistic skill at school, Goldsmiths and beyond, his band with school friend Damon Albarn, fellow student Alex James, and a drummer called Dave Rowntree began to get noticed. But there are things they don't tell you before you get famous. There are monsters out there. And some may even be lurking inside yourself.  Verse, Chorus, Monster!  is an intimate, honest reflection on music, fame, addiction and art by one of Britain's most iconic musicians. "

'David Harewood writes with rare honesty and fearless self-analysis about his experiences of racism and what ultimately led to his descent into psychosis . . . This book is, in itself, a physical manifestation of that hopeful journey.' - David Olusoga, author of  Black and British   This powerful and provocative memoir charts critically acclaimed actor David Harewood's life from working class Birmingham to the bright lights of Hollywood. He shares insights from his recovery after an experience of psychosis and uncovers devastating family history.  Maybe I Don't Belong Here  is a groundbreaking account of the impact of everyday racism on Black mental health and a rallying cry to examine the biases that shape our society. As a young actor, David had a psychotic breakdown and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He was physically restrained by six police officers, sedated, then hospitalized and transferred to a locked ward. Only now, thirty years later, has he been able to process what he went through. What caused this breakdown and how did David recover to become a successful actor? How did his experiences growing up contribute to a rupture in his sense of his place in the world? David's compelling story poses the question: Is it possible to be Black and British and feel welcome and whole?. "
