Hasan, Asmahan, Evans, Mursal and Calvin each tell their story, tracing the trajectory of their lives from homes and families in Syria, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Cameroon to the brutal refugee camps, where they are trapped in a strange and hostile world.  These are compelling, first-person stories of resilience, suffering and hope, told in a depth rarely seen in non-fiction, partly because one of the authors is a refugee himself, and partly because both authors spent years getting to know the interviewees and winning their trust. The women and men in this book tell their stories in their own words, retaining control and dignity, while revealing intimate and heartfelt scenes from their lives.  'Simple, powerful stories told in refugees' own voices. I couldn't stop reading, hand to mouth, my chest tightening.'  - Dina Nayari, author of  The Ungrateful Refugee   'A treasure-trove of story, of heart, of humanity's failures and achievements.'  - Kao Kalia Yang, author of  The Latehomecomer   ' Map of Hope and Sorrow  is not only urgent, it is riveting.'  - Jessica Goudeau, author of  After the Last Border.

I want every woman to be able to move forward, to feel empowered at every stage of their lives. This manual includes all the advice you might expect. Whether you need help with how to dress, defining your style, finding out the colours that suit you or understanding the right beauty routine for the skin you have now, FEARLESS contains it all. But the most important thing that I have come to know is that life is not just about how we look \u2013 it's about gaining the knowledge we need to navigate whatever life throws at us. So, I've included a life section to share what I've learned along the way, the everyday barriers that impact my confidence and how I feel. In each chapter I set you a practical challenge, because there is a big difference between reading and action \u2013 it is action that propels us and allows us to make positive change in your own life. To represent the different ages, shapes, styles and attitudes I cover, the inspiring Trinny Tribers from around the world have all come together to share too. I very much hope this book will help and inspire you. I look forward to sharing this new journey with you. We can all thrive and live fearlessly.

                "'A delightful odyssey through the history, nostalgia, fascination and British love of cake. Quirky, charming, and fun.' PRUE LEITH The British take cakes seriously. We hold strong opinions about how to bake a brownie with the perfect squidge, the correct proportions of icing to sponge, and whether it's jam or cream first on our scones. Now \u2013 thanks to the success of a certain TV baking show \u2013 our flirtation with flour, fruit and frosting has become a full-blown love affair. But how did the humble cake evolve from a simple combination of starch and fat to the show-stopping bakes of today, taking pride of place at every meaningful life celebration? Travelling the country from Dundee to the Isle of Wight, writer Andrew Baker (by name, not occupation) serves up the story of our national obsession with cake, one slice at a time. On this greediest of quests, Andrew seeks to discover the 'True Slice' of each iconic cake. This enviable task sees him eat sponge sandwiched with jam and cream at Queen Victoria's holiday home Osborne House, discover the illustrious yet scandal-filled history of the Battenberg's saccharine squares and learn how a caterpillar enrobed in chocolate became a party-starting birthday centerpiece. From King Alfred's oatcakes to The River Caf\u00e9's revered Chocolate Nemesis, this is the crumb-spattered, buttercream-smeared story of the cakes that have claimed a place on British tables \u2013 and in our hearts.

                "Forced displacement affects millions annually, as they search for safety, yet how many of us take the time to truly understand the asylum seeker experience? Not only confronted with the risks of irregular migration, asylum seekers must navigate border politics imposed by countries seeking to deter and punish those in need. Nameless bodies who wash up on the shores globally have become a contemporary norm. As humans are all deeply connected, a moral responsibility exists to comprehend why asylum seekers seek refuge even if the stakes of death are high. When understanding prevails, compassion and welcome often follow. However, policies of deterrence, signalling to refugees that they are \"not welcome\" have overshadowed an appreciation to understand. Despite asylum seeker deaths being well-publicised, government policies that focus on preventing \"illegal immigration\" often resonate with the populous. The question arises as to why a lack of understanding and hospitality is the dominant discourse. Possible clues are found on faraway Christmas Island, an Australian outpost located in the Indian Ocean, situated much closer to Indonesia than Australia. This book, the result of extensive research, reveals how Australia's asylum seeker policy plays out at the Australian border. It examines how Christmas Islanders responded to asylum seekers and provides insights into why humans respond to strangers in need or turn them away. It opens the aperture for future discussions around the global complexities of welcoming asylum seekers, host communities and immigration border policies, and encourages replacing asylum seeker border deaths with hope and solidarity.

                "They don't make comedy like they used to . . . From the slapstick comedy of Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel, the surrealism of Spike Milligan and Monty Python, and the golden age of political incorrectness helmed by Benny Hill, to the alternative scene that burst forth following the punk movement, the hedonistic joy of Absolutely Fabulous, the lacerating scorn of Jimmy Carr, Ricky Gervais, and Jo Brand and the meteoric rise of socially conscious stand up today: comedy can be many things, and it is a cultural phenomenon has come to define Britain like few others. In Different Times, David Stubbs charts the superstars that were in on the gags, the unsung heroes hiding in the wings and the people who ended up being the butt of the joke. Comedians and their work speak to and of their time, drawing upon and moulding Britons' relationship with their national history, reflecting us as a people, and, simply, providing raucous laughs for millions of people around the world. Different Times is a joyous, witty and insightful paean to British comedy. "

One in seven Americans live below the poverty line, a line which hasn't shifted over the last fifty years, despite the efforts of successive governments and extensive relief programs. Why is there so much scarcity in this land of dollars? In  Poverty, by America , acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond examines the nature of American poverty today and the stories we tell ourselves about it. Spanning racism, social isolation, mass incarceration, the housing crisis, domestic violence, crack and opioid epidemics, welfare cuts and more, Desmond argues that poverty does not result from a lack of resources or good policy ideas. We already know how to eliminate it. The hard part is getting more of us to care. To do so, we need a new story. As things stand, liberals explain poverty through insurmountable structural issues, whereas conservatives highlight personal failings and poor life choices. Both analyses abdicate responsibility, and ignore the reality that the advantages of the rich only come at the expense of the poor. It is time better-paid citizens put themselves back in the narrative, recognizing that the depth and expanse of poverty in any nation reflects our failure to look out for one another. Poverty must ultimately be met by community: all this suffering and want is our doing, and we can undo it. "

                "____________________________________   Liz Murray never really had a chance in life. Born to a drug-addicted father who was in and out of prison, and an equally dependent mother who was in and out of mental institutions, she seemed destined to become just another tragic statistic; another life wasted on the brutal streets of New York.   By the age of 15, Liz found herself homeless with nowhere to turn but the tough streets, riding subways all night for a warm place to sleep and foraging through dumpsters for food. But when her mother died of AIDS a year later, Liz's life changed for ever. With no education, with no chance at a job or a home, she realised that only the most astonishing of turnarounds could stop her heading all the way down the same path her parents took. And so she set her mind to overcoming what seemed like impossible odds - and in the process, achieved something extraordinary. Told with astounding sincerity,  Breaking Night  is the breathtaking and inspirational story of how a young women, born into a world without hope, used every ounce of strength and determination to steer herself towards a brighter future. Beautifully written, it is a poignant, evocative and stirring portrait of struggle, desperation, forgiveness and survival. "

But journalist Kieran Yates has had more than most: by the age of twenty-five she'd lived in twenty different houses across the country, from council estates in London to car showrooms in rural Wales.    In prose that sparkles with humour and warmth, Yates charts the heartbreaks and joys of a life spent navigating the chaos of the housing system.  Drawing on interviews with marginalised tenants across the country and the stories behind our interiors, she explores the unexpected ways we can fight back \u2013 finding beauty in the wreckage of a broken system, friendships in cramped housing conditions, and home even in the most fragile circumstances.  All the Houses I've Ever Lived In   is at once   a rallying cry for change, a gorgeous coming-of-age story and a love letter to home in all its forms.   ____________________________________________  'I read this in two sittings . . . so incisive it's hard to put down'  PANDORA SYKES  'A beautiful exposition of home and what it means.

Part behavioural study, part entertainment, at its heart,  Fans  is a story of collectives, of what happens to us when we interact with people who share our passions. The human brain is wired to reach out, and while our groupish tendencies can bring much strife (religious intolerance, racism, war, etc.), they are also the source of some of our greatest satisfactions. Fandoms offer much of the pleasure of tribalism with little of the harm: a feeling of belonging and of shared culture, a sense of meaning and purpose, improved mental well-being, reassurance that our most outlandish convictions will be taken seriously, and the freedom to try to emulate (and dress like) our hero. In  Fans , Michael Bond explores the subject through the lens of social identity theory, a set of ideas used by social psychologists and anthropologists to understand how people behave in groups and why groups have such a profound effect on human culture.

                "At the threshold of the third millennium, we are more vulnerable to mass epidemics than at any time in our history. Some infectious agents - MRSA, acinetobacter baumanii, Tuberculosis, HIV - are becoming resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Differences in travel and social behaviour spread infections more widely; and, with changes in climate, diseases are either being described for the first time, or appearing in previously unaffected areas. In this fascinating book, infectious disease expert Robert Baker looks at the science, the history and the future of epidemics. He shows what epidemics really are, how they begin and transmit, the various types they are and what they can cause. Following some of the greatest plagues and epidemics of the past - bubonic plague, the great pox, the small pox - he shows the changing world of infectious disease and the possible infections lurking around the corner.

                "Worried that the world is run by a sinister cabal operating at the very highest level of government? You could be right. Bringing together evidence on topics ranging from the Sphinx to JFK, Chernobyl to men in black and life on Mars to Roswell, this book has a cover-up for every occasion.    Laid out in a handy A-Z format, Conspiracy Theories makes it easy to find out about all the major conspiracy theories in the world today.    The archetypal conspiracy theory might go something like this: there is a clandestine secret society in our midst \u2026 they are alien to all we believe in and are about to seize control of the world \u2026 they are everywhere \u2026 they are ruthless and powerful \u2026 they are sexually corrupt \u2026 they perform the most heinous crimes known to mankind.    Belief in conspiracy theories is more than just the belief in an occasional underhand plot. It is a belief system that asserts that world events are being governed in secret by a group of ultra-powerful puppeteers behind the scenes. While little may be done about this sorry state of affairs, at least we can have the satisfaction of having worked out what is going on.    Of course, one can argue that obsession with conspiracy theories serves only to demonstrate the lunatic paranoia running rife in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Much talk about conspiracies is dismissed as paranoia and much of it is paranoia. But in reality, history has proved all too well that politicians lie, presidents lie and bureaucrats lie. If we continue to be gullible and believe everything that is presented to us, the truth will never come out. It becomes not only interesting and revealing but an absolute priority to question authority and, more specifically, the authoritarians.   Why is it that we can accept that Tony Blair\u2019s smile is as broad as it appears? Or that the American CIA assassinated the president of Chile, but we cannot believe that they would assassinate their own? Why is that we can accept that governments would experiment on their citizens with plutonium, syphilis and nerve gas, but don\u2019t consider that they would use the AIDS virus? Why did the German populace accept in the first place that Hitler was trustworthy?    Conspiracy theories are not new. It is believed that Nero concocted an elaborate tale to shift the blame to the Christians for the burning of Rome. Hitler was a master of such deceipt. And, undoubtedly, when conspiracies fail to accurately predict world events, this only serves to prove their credibility. Double bluff is refined to an art form.    It cannot be denied that controversy has often accompanied many of the pivotal turning points of Western civilization. Many major events, for better or for worse, have occurred as the result of people behind the scenes who have held the keys to the actions of the world. Startling discoveries, often stretching far back into history, can affect the very way our Western thought processes and behaviour patterns are conducted. And that is not to mention such terrifying revelations as the Elvis Killed Kennedy conspiracy or the real reason for Santa\u2019s oversized hat. Read on \u2026. "

                "According to most experts, bird flu is coming. It's not a question of if, but when. In 1918 up to 50 million died in the Spanish Influenza outbreak; with increased global travel, this next pandemic could be even worse. The avian flu virus, H5N1, could kill millions upon millions if it mixes with a human strain of influenza. It poses more of a threat to global society than terrorism, natural disasters or economic collapse. Our governments are aware of the threat, but are radically unprepared to protect us. Beat the Flu shows you how to protect yourself and your loved ones from bird flu, as well as regular flu. Full of life-saving tips, from the best way to clean your home and where to purchase effective air filters, to how to get hold of antiviral medication before it runs out, Beat the Flu also explores what to do if society breaks down following a major pandemic. By the time H5N1 mutates into its final 'breakout' form there is a 95% probability it will be too late to develop a vaccine. This book is packed with advice to keep you healthy. "

                "This harrowing account from the front lines of the Afghan civil war can stand comparison with such masterpieces as Michael Herr\u2019s Dispatches or George Orwell\u2019s Homage to Catalonia. Sometimes lyrical, sometimes harrowing, sometimes absurdly comic, NIGHT LETTERS gives an indelible human face to a conflict that few Americans have followed or understood.   Rob Schultheis fell in love with Afghanistan in the 1970s, when it was a wild, unspoiled country that had barely changed in the past five hundred years. When this ancient land suddenly plunged into civil war between a Soviet-backed Communist government and implacable Muslim rebels, Schultheis found himself drawn to telling its heartbreaking story. Throughout the 1980s, he reported on the war from the front lines, risking his lifetime after time as he penetrated into the mountains of Afghanistan with the mujahedin insurgents.    NIGHT LETTERS is an impressionistic first-person chronicle that conveys, with frightening immediacy, the nature of a war where men armed with bolt-action rifles squared off against tanks and helicopter gunships \u2013weapons that could, and routinely did, reduce an ancient village to rubble in minutes. Yet the outgunned and outnumbered mujahedin never considered giving up the fight. Ultimately, they exhausted the Soviet occupiers. Not without reason was Afghanistan called \u201cthe Soviets\u2019 Vietnam.\u201d     A cautionary tale for superpowers, a stark reminder of the barbarity of war, and most of all, a striking tale of the resilient human spirit, NIGHT LETTERS now includes a brand new introduction written in the wake of the terrorist attacks on America from the author, offering a glimpse into what the future of Afghanistan holds for our country.     ROB SCHULTHEIS lives in Telluride, Colorado. He has covered Afghanistan for several publications, including Time, the Washington Post, the San Francisco Examiner, and The New York Times Magazine. His previous books are Bone Games, The Hidden West, and Fool\u2019s Gold. "

Despite twelve months' tireless hard work Jane was unable to stop the extradition, and as John reached Morocco they both feared the worst ...An extraordinary tale of horror and endurance, \"Extradited\" is also a remarkable love story and a gripping adventure.

                "From the bestselling author of American Tragedy and Perfect Murder, Perfect Town comes an even more stunning portrayal of America's dark side. Into the Mirror is the shocking story of FBI Special Agent Robert P. Hanssen, the master spy who singlehandedly created the greatest breach of security in the history of the United States.     Written in novelistic prose, Lawrence Schiller re-creates a gripping portrait of Hanssen, who for twenty-two years was a loving husband, a devoted father of six, a deeply devout Catholic and member of Opus Dei, a passionate anticommunist, a dedicated FBI agent -- and a traitor the likes of which the United States has never before seen.     On February 18, 2001, the FBI finally arrested Hanssen and charged him with selling to the Russians -- over a period of more than twenty years -- top-secret, classified information. Nothing that has been reported to date about this ordinary-looking but tormented man has revealed the astonishing facts that Lawrence Schiller and Norman Mailer -- collaborators on the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Executioner's Song and Oswald's Tale -- uncovered during their nine-month investigation into the life of this complex man. In seeking to solve this almost impenetrable mystery, Schiller and Mailer spent hundreds of hours interviewing members of Hanssen's family as well as his closest friends, colleagues, and fellow church members. They traveled to Moscow to interview a key member of the KGB who had handled the spy they knew only as \"Ramon Garcia.\"    Into the Mirror gets inside the mind of a devious and dangerously brilliant man and creates an unforgettable portrait of someone so caught up in the struggle with his own personal demons that he would betray everything he holds sacred -- his wife, his family, his religion, and his country.

                "'Beautifully written, sumptuously illustrated, constantly fascinating'  The Times   On 26 November 1922 Howard Carter first peered into the newly opened tomb of an ancient Egyptian boy-king. When asked if he could see anything, he replied: 'Yes, yes, wonderful things.' In Tutankhamun's Trumpet, acclaimed Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson takes a unique approach to that tomb and its contents. Instead of concentrating on the oft-told story of the discovery, or speculating on the brief life and politically fractious reign of the boy king, Wilkinson takes the objects buried with him as the source material for a wide-ranging, detailed portrait of ancient Egypt \u2013 its geography, history, culture and legacy. One hundred artefacts from the tomb, arranged in ten thematic groups, are allowed to speak again \u2013 not only for themselves, but as witnesses of the civilization that created them. Never before have the treasures of Tutankhamun been analysed and presented for what they can tell us about ancient Egyptian culture, its development, its remarkable flourishing, and its lasting impact. Filled with surprising insights, unusual details, vivid descriptions and, above all, remarkable objects,  Tutankhamun's Trumpet  will appeal to all lovers of history, archaeology, art and culture, as well as all those fascinated by the Egypt of the pharaohs.

The Arthurian story, based on fact and fiction, is central to Britain's 'creation myth' and the concept of Britain's heroic past. This is a deeply researched and scholarly but essentially accessible history and analysis for general readers and specialists and based on an impressive array of sources including Romano-British, Anglo-Saxon, rare medieval English, French and German sources, and archaeology - essential for modern historical research in early history. Modern and contemporary historiography is covered including 'debunking' treatments. The study surveys King Arthur in fact and fiction, his family, knights, and the legends that have grown up around them and developed to the enduring interest from history, literature to TV and film.

From barrister Harriet Johnson, Enough lays bare the appalling status quo of abuse against women in our society, offering an irrefutable case for why change is needed in policing and justice. Most vitally, it also gives a manifesto for how to get there. With expertise, clear-sightedness and appropriate fury, this book helps us see where women are suffering \u2013 from homicide to domestic abuse to street harassment. It exposes the ways the criminal justice system lets women down \u2013 from officers failing to properly investigate to a lack of consequences when police behaviour is unacceptable, to backlogged courts and the realities of convincing a jury. Addressing misogyny is to everyone's benefit and the answers aren't simple. Enough is the call to arms we can \u2013 and must \u2013 all get behind. "

To have sailed on \u2018the voyage of the century\u2019 aboard White Star Line\u2019s RMS  Titanic  \u2013 described at the time as \u2018a floating palace\u2019 \u2013 was like being one of the first passengers to fly on Concorde. On 10 April 1912, people from all walks of life began embarking on  Titanic , then the largest ship afloat, for what was to be the trip of a lifetime on the ship\u2019s maiden voyage across the north Atlantic. Many were looking forward to starting new lives in the United States. However, just before midnight on Sunday, 14 April 1912,  Titanic \u2019s crew began to send out distress signals stating, \u2018We have struck an iceberg.' The liner had been steaming at speed when it collided with an enormous iceberg which stripped off her bilge under the waterline for more than 100 yards, opened up five of the front compartments and flooded the coal bunker servicing one of the boilers. The damage was fatal, and some three hours after the disaster began to unfold the last visible part of  Titanic  slipped beneath the waves. There were only sixteen lifeboats and four collapsible dinghies \u2013 which was completely insufficient for the number of passengers making the crossing. As a consequence, more than 1,500 passengers and crew died: two out of every three people onboard perished. Much has been written about the  Titanic  disaster, and it has been the subject matter for several films. The author is well-known for his depth of research and his attention to detail, and in a new style of format, he has selected fifty people involved in the disaster, and by using their specific eyewitness accounts he has managed to make the confusing situation much clearer, making it possible for the reader to experience the dreadful events as they unfolded. The book also includes biographical tributes to the fifty people, who came from all walks of life and geographical regions, telling who they were, their experiences during the disaster, and what happened to those who were fortunate enough to survive.

                "A riveting journey into the psyche of Britain through its golden age of television and film; a cross-genre feast of moving pictures, from classics to occult hidden gems,  The Magic Box  is the nation's visual self-portrait in technicolour detail.   'The definition of gripping. Truly, a trove of wyrd treasures.'  BENJAMIN MYERS   'A lovingly researched history of British TV [that] recalls the brilliant, the bizarre and the unworldly.'   GUARDIAN    'A reclamation, not just of a visual 'golden age', but of Britain as a darkly magical place.'   THE SPECTATOR    'A feat of argument, description and affection.'   FINANCIAL TIMES   'Young unearths the ghosts of TV past - and Britain's dark psyche.'   HERALD   'Highly entertaining . . . [A] fabulous treasure trove.'   SCOTSMAN   'Young is a phenomonal scholar.'   OBSERVER   'Impassioned.'   THE CRITIC   Growing up in the 1970s, Rob Young's main storyteller was the wooden box with the glass window in the corner of the family living room, otherwise known as the TV set. Before the age of DVDs and Blu-ray discs, YouTube and commercial streaming services, watching television was a vastly different experience. You switched on, you sat back and you watched. There was no pause or fast-forward button. The cross-genre feast of moving pictures produced in Britain between the late 1950s and late 1980s - from  Quatermass  and  Tom Jones  to  The Wicker Man  and  Brideshead Revisited , from  A Canterbury Tale  and  The Go-Between  to  Bagpuss  and  Children of the Stones , and from John Betjeman's travelogues to ghost stories at Christmas - contributed to a national conversation and collective memory. British-made sci-fi, folk horror, period drama and televisual grand tours played out tensions between the past and the present, dramatised the fractures and injustices in society and acted as a portal for magical and ghostly visions. In  The Magic Box , Rob Young takes us on a fascinating journey into this influential golden age of screen and discovers what it reveals about the nature and character of Britain, its uncategorisable people and buried histories - and how its presence can still be felt on screen in the twenty-first century. '[A] forensic dissection . . . this tightly packed treatise takes pains to illustrate how what we view affects how we view ourselves.'   TOTAL FILM. "

Starting with underwear \u2013 did you know Elizabeth I owned just one pair of drawers, worn only after her death? \u2013 she moves garment by garment through Western attire, exploring both the items we still wear every day and those that have gone the way of the dodo (sugared petticoats, farthingales and spatterdashers to name but a few).  Beautifully illustrated throughout, and crammed with fascinating and eminently quotable facts,  Stitches in Time  shows how the way we dress is inextricably bound up with considerations of aesthetics, sex, gender, class and lifestyle \u2013 and offers us the chance to truly appreciate the extraordinary qualities of these, our most ordinary possessions.

                "Studying dress history teaches us much about the past. In this skillfully illustrated, accessible and authoritative book, Jayne Shrimpton demonstrates how fashion and clothes represent the everyday experiences of earlier generations, illuminating the world in which they lived. As Britain evolved during the 1800s from a slow-paced agrarian society into an urban-industrial nation, dress was transformed. Traditional rural styles declined and modern city modes, new workwear and holiday gear developed. Women sewed at home, while shopping advanced, novel textiles and mass-produced goods bringing affordable fashion to ordinary people. Many of our predecessors worked as professional garment-makers, laundresses or in other related trades: close to fashion production, as consumers they looked after their clothes. The author explains how, understanding the social significance of dress, the Victorians observed strict etiquette through special costumes for Sundays, marriage and mourning. Poorer families struggled to maintain standards, but young single workers spent their wages on clothes, the older generation cultivating their own discreet style. Twentieth-century dress grew more relaxed and democratic as popular culture influenced fashion for recent generations who enjoyed sport, cinema, music and dancing. "

Have you ever fantasized about being ridiculously wealthy? Probably. Striking it rich is among the most resilient of American fantasies, surviving war and peace, expansions and recessions, economic meltdowns and global pandemics. We dream of the jackpot, the big exit, the life-altering payday, in whatever form that takes. (Americans spent $81  billion  on lottery tickets in 2019, more than the GDPs of most nations.) We would escape \"essential\" day jobs and cramped living spaces, bury our debts, buy that sweet spread, and bail out struggling friends and relations. But rarely do we follow the fantasy to its conclusion\u2014to ponder the social, psychological, and societal downsides of great affluence and the fact that so few possess it.   What is it  actually  like to be blessed with riches in an era of plagues, political rancor, and near-Dickensian economic differences? How mind-boggling are the opportunities and access, how problematic the downsides? Does the experience differ depending on whether the money is earned or unearned, where it comes from, and whether you are male or female, white or black? Finally, how does our collective lust for affluence, and our stubborn belief in social mobility, explain how we got to the point where forty percent of Americans have literally no wealth at all?   These are all questions that  Jackpot  sets out to explore. The result of deep reporting and dozens of interviews with fortunate citizens\u2014company founders and executives, superstar coders, investors, inheritors, lottery winners, lobbyists, lawmakers, academics, sports agents, wealth and philanthropy professionals, concierges, luxury realtors, Bentley dealers, and even a woman who trains billionaires' nannies in physical combat,  Jackpot  is a compassionate, character-rich, perversely humorous, and ultimately troubling journey into the American wealth fantasy and where it has taken us.

High inside a cast cave in Borneo, men perched on rickety ladders collect swiftlets' nests, a delicacy believed to be a cure for almost anything.    These luxury products are two of the seven natural wonders whose stories  Harvest  tells: eiderdown, vicu\u00f1a wool, sea silk, vegetable ivory, civet coffee, guano and edible birds' nests. It follows their journey from the wildest parts of the planet, traversing Iceland, Indonesia, and Peru, to its urban centres, drawing on the voices of the gatherers, shearers and entrepreneurs who harvest, process and trade them.   Blending interviews, history and travel writing,  Harvest  sets these human stories against our changing economic and ecological landscape, and makes us see the world with wonder, curiosity and new concern.

                "For centuries, there have been children who have not lived with their birth parents for a range of reasons and have been taken into the care of the state, voluntary societies, other families or employers, temporarily or permanently. The origins of this book lie in Rosemary Steer\u2019s study of the lives of over 300 children who came into the care of a charity in the village of Dickleburgh in Norfolk started in the 1870s by the Rector\u2019s wife, Mrs Louisa Brandreth. This book extends the study of children in care across the country to cover the main period of the Poor Law Amendment Act (the \u2018new poor law\u2019) from 1834 to 1929. Using a wide range of sources including contemporary social commentaries and inquiries, poor law records, charity case files, court records, newspapers, parliamentary inquiries, census returns, parish records and personal accounts, Rosemary Steer details the range of provision and explores the lives of some of these children, before, during and after their time in care. Research into the care of pauper children has usually been anonymized, but  Children in Care  includes examples of named children, and through numerous case studies, we hear these children\u2019s stories, sometimes in their own words or those of the adults who had charge of them. It is unlikely that many of these pauper children would feature in any other study, other than individually within the context of family history, so this book also has the benefit of highlighting the lives of some of the least regarded of society.

Darren McGarvey has experienced poverty and its devastating effects first-hand. He knows why people from deprived communities all around Britain feel angry and unheard. And he wants to explain . . .   So he invites you to come on a safari of sorts. But not the kind where the wildlife is surveyed from a safe distance. This book takes you inside the experience of poverty to show how the pressures really feel and how hard their legacy is to overcome.   Arguing that both the political left and right misunderstand poverty as it is actually lived, McGarvey sets out what everybody \u2013 including himself \u2013 could do to change things. Razor-sharp, fearless and brutally honest,  Poverty Safari  is an unforgettable insight into modern Britain. "

It will tell the highly personal, human and sometimes surprisingly uplifting stories of real people struggling in a crumbling system. By telling their stories, we will come to know these people; to know their hopes and fears, their complexities and their contradictions. We will learn a little more about human relationships, in all their messiness. And we'll learn how, with just a little too much misfortune, any of us could find ourselves homeless, even become one of the hundreds of people dying on Britain's streets.  As the number of rough sleepers skyrockets across the UK,  No Fixed Abode  by Maeve McClenaghan will also bring to light many of the ad-hoc projects attempting to address the problem. You will meet some of the courageous people who dedicate their lives to saving the forgotten of our society and see that the smallest act of kindness or affection can save a life. This is a timely and important book encompassing wider themes of inequality and austerity measures; through the prism of homelessness, it offers a true picture of Britain today \u2013 and shows how terrifyingly close to breaking point we really are.

                "**THE  FINANCIAL TIMES  BUSINESS BOOK OF THE MONTH** THE GRIPPING TALE OF THE EARLY FRONTIER DAYS OF SILICON VALLEY FROM ACCLAIMED HISTORIAN LESLIE BERLIN.    'The book is compelling  as it maps out the building of the Valley, the challenges its early tech pioneers faced, as well as highlighting those who reached dizzying success only to suffer as the dot com bubble burst .'  Financial Times    ' Kaleidoscopic, ambitious, and brilliant , the book  draws on a dazzling cast of characters  to chart the rise of the five industries that have come to define technology today and, collectively, to remake the world.'  Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google and Executive Chairman of Alphabet, Inc.   Leslie Berlin's  previous work has been acclaimed by  the  New York Times  :  'so engagingly narrated that you don't realize how much business and technology you are learning along the way.'   Between 1968 and 1976, five landmark industries that shaped the modern world were launched within 30 miles of each other: personal computing, video games, biotechnology, modern venture capital and advanced semi-conductor logic.   The dominant players in many of those industries - firms like  Apple  and  Intel    - had also been launched at the same time. During those early days of Silicon Valley, the first ARPANET transmission (now known as the Internet) came into a Stanford lab, universities began licensing innovations to businesses, and the Silicon Valley tech community began to develop their lobbying clout.   Now, for the first time, the stories of the men and women who changed the world during these pivotal years are brought to life in rich detail by respected Silicon Valley historian  Leslie Berlin.  Berlin  shines a light on the wild frontier days of Silicon Valley where the old rules were broken,  revealing how the modern tech world was built and empires were forged.     Troublemakers  is a compelling story of the upstarts of Silicon Valley that will appeal to fans of HBO's  Silicon Valley  and Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs.    Further praise for  Troublemakers:    'Leslie Berlin combines the keen observations of an historian with  gorgeous writing and riveting storytelling to write the landmark book on the Valley.  The interwoven lives of wonderfully iconoclastic characters bring the formative years of the Valley to life with sheer brilliance.   Troublemakers  is a must-read  for anyone hoping to understand America's tech capital.'  Julia Flynn Siler,    New York Times    bestselling author of    The House of Mondavi    'Leslie Berlin has done it again. Following on her richly informative biography of Intel co-founder Robert Noyce,  The Man Behind the Microchip , Berlin now brings us a definitive account of Silicon Valley's \"breakthrough years\" in the 1970s.  Troublemakers  recounts the fascinating careers of seven little-known but enormously impactful players who shaped the Valley's unique high-tech ecosystem. As entertaining as it is authoritative,  T roublemakers    is required reading for anyone seeking to understand how the tech revolution took root in the San Francisco Bay Area and eventually transformed the entire planet's way of life .'  David M. Kennedy, Donald J. McLachlan Professor of History Emeritus at Stanford University, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. "

Alexandra Shulman reveals the emotional and logistical minefield of producing the 100th anniversary issue ( that  Duchess of Cambridge cover surprise), organizing the star-studded Vogue 100 Gala, working with designers from Victoria Beckham to Karl Lagerfeld and contributors from David Bailey to Alexa Chung. All under the continual scrutiny of a television documentary crew. But narrowly-contained domestic chaos hovers - spontaneous combustion in the kitchen, a temperamental boiler and having to send bin day reminders all the way from Milan fashion week. For anyone who wants to know what the life of a fashion magazine editor is  really  like, or for any woman who loves her job, this is a rich, honest and sharply observed account of a year lived at the centre of British fashion and culture.

She has interviewed emigration officials and members of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Geneva while investigating the fates of the 17 million people currently displaced from their homes.How can society cope with this diaspora of the twenty-first century? Is there a difference between 'good' asylum seekers and 'bad' economic migrants? What happens to those whose applications are turned down? The difficult questions are asked, the horrible issues faced. But, above all, Human Cargo celebrates the courage and will to survive shown by ordinary human beings. "

A truly universal product, it has even been served in space.  From Istanbul to Mexico City, Mark travels the globe investigating the stories and people Coca-Cola's iconic advertising campaigns don't mention. Child labourers in the sugar cane fields of El Salvador. Indian workers exposed to toxic chemicals. Colombian union leaders falsely accused of terrorism and jailed alongside the paramilitaries who want to kill them. And many more...  Provocative, funny and stirring, Belching Out the Devil investigates the truth behind one of the planet's biggest brands. "

The kind of technological revolution that they led in Silicon Valley is now sweeping through China, but with much more dramatic implications. The dynamic entrepreneurs who are using technology to radically transform business and cultural life in China are fighting not only outdated business models and a tumultuous economy but also an unpredictable government that has a love-hate relationship with the Net, at once pushing its expansion at a feverish pace and censoring it. As Duncan Clark, cofounder of BDA, an Internet consulting company in Beijing, told author David Sheff, \"This environment \u2014 the regulations, the competition, the political uncertainties \u2014 makes these the fastest, most courageous, nimblest-thinking people globally. To deal with this level of risk and still sleep is no small accomplishment. But they're hooked on it like some Chinese are becoming hooked on Starbucks cappuccino.\"  In this irresistible, groundbreaking book, Sheff takes us into the trenches of the Chinese technology revolution, introducing the major and minor players who are leading China into the twenty-first century. Players like Bo Feng, the charismatic former sushi chef who is now one of the leading venture capitalists in China. And Edward Tian, a national hero who has been described as China's Steve Jobs and Bill Gates combined, who left his own start-up on the eve of its IPO in order to lead the government's attempt to bring broadband to the entire nation, in the process leapfrogging the United States, Europe, and the rest of Asia with the longest and fastest network in the world.   As the U.S. technological revolution wanes, business leaders will be looking to the billion-plus potential customers in China for new growth. In addition, the world's newest member of the World Trade Organization will no longer be a bystander in the global economy; it will be a fierce competitor. And when hundreds of million Chinese have access to unprecedented information and communication, China itself will be profoundly altered. Jay Chang, an analyst who covers China for Credit Suisse First Boston, sums the seismic nature of the changes: \"What happens when China successfully transforms from a mainly agrarian/industrial nation into one that has significant input from the information technology industry? What happens when eighty percent of the state-owned enterprises in China are able to link economically to the global Internet on fast pipes? What happens when China's engineering talent pool is able to gain access to high-end computing resources and exchange ideas and information easily with their global peers? What happens when fifty percent of the Chinese population gets wired in ten years \u2014 six hundred million people, the largest number of Internet users in the world?\" With its compelling, character-driven story, researched over the course of three years, China Dawn will be the definitive book on the subject.

This remarkable book offers a firsthand account of what it is to be a police officer, an FBI agent or a reporter obsessed with a case few people will take seriously. It contains a first-person account of Miller's face-to-face meeting with bin Laden and provides the first full-length treatment to piece together what led up to the events of 9/11, ultimately delivering the disturbing answer to the question: Why, with all the information the intelligence community had, was no one able to stop the 9/11 attacks?.

                "Lim Chin Siong was the most prominent left-wing leader in Singapore for a decade until he was eliminated from the political scene by the infamous Operation Coldstore on February 2, 1963. This book is an account of Lim's significance in Singapore's political developments in the decade preceding. It also contains tributes by his friends and colleagues in Singapore and Malaysia. This new edition features an essay by Dr Poh Soo Kai and an extract from Lim's posthumous manuscripts. It will redefine the debate on the post-war history of both countries and the legacy of continuing political repression in them. \"The entire Singapore Special Branch file of evidence against Lim, including the transcription of Lim's 'Pah Mata' speech, has been unearthed from files recently declassified by the National Archives of the UK. The Special Branch files show they had no evidence on which they could convict Lim of any crime. In order to justify his detention without trial in 1956, the government deliberately misrepresented Lim Chin Siong's speech. After the PAP came into power, it did not provide the opportunity for Lim to clear his name either. It remains an open question if any of the detentions over the last sixty years were justified. The Internal Security Act remains in operation today. To ensure that this Act has been used appropriately and responsibly, an open Commission of Enquiry into the detentions of Singapore's political detainees is needed to set the facts straight once and for all. Only by learning the truth of our own collective past can we learn and grow as a nation.\" \u2013 Dr Thum Ping Tjin (2014) "

But not anymore... This book chronicles the forgotten queens from across the globe \u2013 those who ruled in their own right, and those who were wives or mothers of reigning kings. All of whom wielded significant power. A smattering of queens, such as Queen Elizabeth I and Catherine the Great of Russia, are known and celebrated, but many more have been glossed over, maligned by historians or dismissed as mere bit-players on the world stage. We are all familiar with the great Roman emperors but what of Queen Zenobia, a rebel queen of the Middle East who took on the Roman Empire? William the Conqueror, the Norman invader of England in 1066, is an iconic figure in history, but how much do you know about his powerful ally and wife Matilda of Flanders? Long Live the Queens rescues these phenomenal women from obscurity, exploring their achievements and deeds, and shedding light on the sacrifices female rulers throughout history have had to make in a patriarchal world. Learn about the trailblazers, game-changers and mighty monarchs who have no business in being forgotten. "

'A timely reminder of what truly great journalists can achieve .'  David Olusoga    'It is impossible to overstate the importance of this heartbreaking book.' James O'Brien   Amelia Gentleman's expos\u00e9 of the Windrush scandal shocked the nation, and led to the resignation of Amber Rudd as Home Secretary. Her tenacious reporting revealed how the government's 'hostile environment' immigration policy had led to thousands of law-abiding people being wrongly classified as illegal immigrants, with many being removed from the country, and many more losing their homes and their jobs.  In  The Windrush Betrayal , Gentleman tells the full story of her investigation for the first time. Her writing shines a light on the people directly affected by the scandal and illustrates the devastating effect of politicians becoming so disconnected from the world outside Westminster that they become oblivious to the impact of their policy decisions. This is a vitally important account that exposes deeply disturbing truths about modern Britain.

                "The Award-winning International Bestselling Story of One Man's Six Year Detention in Australia In 2013, Kurdish journalist Behrouz Boochani sought asylum in Australia but was instead illegally imprisoned in the country's most notorious detention centre on Manus Island. He has been there ever since. This book is the result.Behrouz Boochani spent nearly five years typing passages of this book one text at a time from a secret mobile phone in prison. Compiled and translated from Farsi, they form an incredible story of how escaping political persecution in Iran, he ended up trapped as a stateless person. This vivid, gripping portrait of his years of incarceration and exile shines devastating light on the fates of so many people as borders close around the world.No Friend but the Mountains is both a brave act of witness and a moving testament to the humanity of all people, in the most extreme of circumstances.'A brilliant book. No Friend but the Mountains can rightly take its place on the shelf of world prison literature . . . It is a profound victory for a young poet who showed us all how much words can still matter.' - Richard Flanagan, Booker Prize winning author of The Narrow Road to the Deep North. "

                "Dealer banks&#8212;that is, large banks that deal in securities and derivatives, such as J. P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs&#8212;are of a size and complexity that sharply distinguish them from typical commercial banks. When they fail, as we saw in the global financial crisis, they pose significant risks to our financial system and the world economy. How Big Banks Fail and What to Do about It examines how these banks collapse and how we can prevent the need to bail them out.In sharp, clinical detail, Darrell Duffie walks readers step-by-step through the mechanics of large-bank failures. He identifies where the cracks first appear when a dealer bank is weakened by severe trading losses, and demonstrates how the bank's relationships with its customers and business partners abruptly change when its solvency is threatened. As others seek to reduce their exposure to the dealer bank, the bank is forced to signal its strength by using up its slim stock of remaining liquid capital. Duffie shows how the key mechanisms in a dealer bank's collapse&#8212;such as Lehman Brothers' failure in 2008&#8212;derive from special institutional frameworks and regulations that influence the flight of short-term secured creditors, hedge-fund clients, derivatives counterparties, and most devastatingly, the loss of clearing and settlement services.How Big Banks Fail and What to Do about It reveals why today's regulatory and institutional frameworks for mitigating large-bank failures don't address the special risks to our financial system that are posed by dealer banks, and outlines the improvements in regulations and market institutions that are needed to address these systemic risks.

His father lived the life of an affluent gentleman whilst his mother was forced to steal bread to feed her starving children. Life was tough and from the moment Jeff could walk he learned to go door to door, begging rags from the rich, which he sold down the markets.  Leaving school at the age of fourteen, he embarked on an extraordinary journey, and found himself, before the age of thirty, a millionaire. Then, after a cruel twist of fate left him penniless, he, his wife and children were forced out of their beautiful home . . . With nothing but holes in his pockets, Jeff had no alternative but to go back down the markets and start all over again. Did he still have what it took? Could he really get back everything he had lost?   A Pocketful of Holes and Dreams  is the heartwarming true story of a little boy who had nothing but gained everything and proof that, sometimes, rags can be turned into riches . . .   ______________   'An inspirational tale of hard work and determination'  5* Reader review     'I just loved this book from the first chapter - I was gripped'  5* Reader review.

                "From the hugely respected journalist Miranda Sawyer, a very modern look at the midlife crisis &#8211; delving into the truth, and lies, of the experience and how to survive it, with thoughtfulness, insight and humour. 'You wake one day and everything is wrong. It's as though you went out one warm evening &#8211; an evening fizzing with delicious potential, so ripe and sticky-sweet you can taste it on the air &#8211; for just one drink ... and woke up two days later in a skip. Except you're not in a skip, you're in an estate car, on the way to an out-of-town shopping mall to buy a balance bike, a roof rack and some stackable storage boxes.' Miranda Sawyer's midlife crisis began when she was 44. It wasn't a traditional one. She didn't run off with a Pilates teacher, or blow thousands on a trip to find herself. From the outside, all remained the same. Work, kids, marriage, mortgage, blah. Days, weeks and months whizzed past as she struggled with feeling &#8211; knowing &#8211; that she was over halfway through her life. It seemed only yesterday that she was 29, out and about. Out of Time is not a self-help book. It's an exploration of this sudden crisis, this jolt. It looks at how our tastes, and our bodies, change as we get older. It considers the unexpected new pleasures that the second half of life can offer, from learning to code to taking up running (slowly). Speaking to musicians and artists, friends and colleagues, Miranda asks how they too have confronted midlife, and the lessons, if any, that they've learned along the way. "

                "From a decidedly inauspicious start as a low-rated television series in the 1960s that was cancelled after three seasons, Star Trek has grown to become a multi-billion-dollar industry of spin-off series, feature films and merchandise. Fuelling the ever-expanding franchise are some of the most rabid and loyal fans in the universe, known affectionately as Trekkies. Perhaps no other community so typifies fandom as the devoted aficionados of the Star Trek television series, motion pictures, novels, comic books and conventions. Indeed, in many respects, Star Trek fans created modern fan culture and continue to push its frontiers with elaborate fan-generated video productions, electronic fan fiction collectives and a proliferation of tribute sites in cyberspace. In this anthology, a panel of rising and established popular culture scholars examines the phenomenon of Star Trek fan culture and its most compelling dimensions. The book explores such topics as the impact of the recent 'rebooting' of the iconic franchise on its fan base; the complicated and often contentious relationship between Star Trek and its lesbian and gay fans; the adaptation of Star Trek to other venues, including live theatre, social media and gaming; fan hyperreality, including parody and non-geek fandom; one iconic actor's social agenda; and alternative fan reactions to the franchise's villains. The resulting collection is both a snapshot and moving picture of the practices and attitudes of a fan culture that is arguably the world's best known and most misunderstood. Striking a balanced tone, the contributors are critical yet respectful, acknowledging the uniquely close and enduring relationship between fans and the franchise while approaching it with appropriate objectivity, distance and scope. Accessible to a variety of audiences - from the newcomer to fan culture to those already well read on the subject - this book will be heralded by fans as well as serious scholars. "

                "Just when you thought paper couldn't be more exciting, this book comes your way! This book--jammed full of paper--unites philosophy with one of the best shows ever: The Office. Addressing both the current American incarnation and the original British version, The Office and Philosophy brings these two wonders of civilization together for a frolic through the mundane yet curiously edifying worlds of Scranton's Dunder-Mifflin and Slough's Wernham-Hogg.Is Michael Scott in denial about death? Are Pam and Jim ever going to figure things out? Is David Brent an essentialist? Surprisingly, The Office can teach us about the mind, Aristotle, and humiliation. Even more surprisingly, paper companies can allow us to better understand business ethics. Don't believe it? Open this book, and behold its beautiful paper...Join the philosophical fray as we explore the abstract world of philosophy through concrete scenes of the unexamined life in The Office. You may discover that Gareth Keenan is secretly a brilliant logician, that Dwight Schrute is better off deceiving himself, that David Brent is an example of hyperreality, and that Michael Scott is hopelessly lost (but you probably already knew that!).

                "Museums in China have undergone tremendous transformations since they first appeared in the country in the late nineteenth century. Futuristic, state-of-the-art museums have today become symbols of China's global cultural, economic and technological prominence, and over the last two decades, the number of Chinese museums has increased at an unprecedented rate, with China set to become the countrywith the highest number of museums in the world. But why have museums become so important? This book, based on extensive research in a number of the museums themselves, examines recent changes intheir display methods, narratives, actors and architectural style. It also considers their representations of Chinese national identity, millenarian history and extraordinary cultural diversity. Through an analysis of the changes affecting not only what we observe through museums, but also the very medium of observation (i.e. museums themselves), this book provides a unique, original and timely exploration of the ongoing changes affecting Chinese society, and an evaluation of their consequences.  Dr Marzia Varutti is a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Museum Studies, Department of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages, University of Oslo. "

This valuable book represents the kind of can-do thinking that we need to see' David MilibandAn eye-opening account of the migrant crisis which shows why our global refugee regime is broken and how it can be fixed Europe is facing its greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War, yet the institutions responding to it remain virtually unchanged from those created in the post-war era. As neighbouring countries continue to bear the brunt of the Syrian catastrophe, European governments have enacted a series of ill-considered gestures, from shutting their borders to welcoming refugees without a plan for their safe passage or integration upon arrival. With a deepening crisis and a xenophobic backlash in Europe, it is time for a new vision for refuge. Going beyond the scenes of desperation which have become all too familiar in the past few years, Alexander Betts and Paul Collier show that this crisis offers an opportunity for reform if international policy-makers focus on delivering humane, effective and sustainable outcomes - both for Europe and for countries that border conflict zones. Refugees need more than simply food, tents and blankets, and research demonstrates that they can offer tangible economic benefits to their adopted countries if given the right to work and education. An urgent and necessary work, Refuge sets out an alternative vision that can empower refugees to help themselves, contribute to their host societies, and even rebuild their countries of origin. "

Game Theory is the mathematical formalisation of interactive decision-making - it assumes that each player's goal is to maximise his/her benefit, whatever it may be. Players may be friends, foes, political parties, states, or any entity that behaves interactively, whether collectively or individually. One of the problems with game analysis is the fact that, as a player, it s very hard to know what would benefit each of the other players; some of us are not even clear about our own goals or what might actually benefit us.

                "'Human history is not just a history of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, [and] kindness. What we choose to emphasise in this complex history will define our lives...'&#8212;Howard Zinn In February 2002, a violent storm of engineered sectarian hatred broke out and raged for many months in Gujarat; blood flowed freely on the streets and tens of thousands of homes were razed to the ground. An estimated 2000 men, women and children, mostly from the Muslim community, were raped and murdered, and more than two hundred thousand people fled in terror as their homes and livelihoods were systematically destroyed. However, Gujarat abounds with thousands of untold stories of faith and courage that endured amidst the fear and hate&#8212;Dhuraji and Babuben Thakur who sheltered 110 Muslims for ten days in their home; of Rambhai Adivasi who restored his Muslim neighbour's roof in the face of local opposition, Rabiya of Ratanpur who waits in the hope that the people from her village will call her back one day and then every thing will be all right, Bilkis Bano and Niyaz Bibi whose perseverance and determination have made them symbols of courage in the face of adversity. Harsh Mander's Fear and Forgiveness: The Aftermath of Massacre, written over the past six years, is not just about the grim events of 2002, of the state's lack of accountability and the failure of justice, of the numerous commissions and their reports, of the indiscriminate use of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002, of police brutality and the trauma of relief camps. It is about the acts of compassion and courage, of the hundreds who risked their own lives and those of their families and their homes to save innocent men, women and children, and even today help the betrayed and shattered minority heal and rebuild. The book compels us to acknowledge the flaws in our judicial, social and rehabilitative structures while showing that the way forward must be one of sympathy, understanding and forgiveness. "

After six years of bonded labour in a Pakistani carpet factory, Iqbal escaped the clutches of his tyrannical carpet-master, and then tirelessly worked to spread the word to other enslaved children that they could be free too. He addressed international conventions on behalf of the Bonded Labour Liberation Front and participated in raids on illegal factories. He was awarded the Reebok 'Youth in Action' Award, and a scholarship to study law in Boston. But before he could study, his life was cut short by a hail of bullets from the gun of an unknown sympathiser with the carpet-masters. "

However, In ChinAmerica, Handel Jones, a pioneer in creating Sino-American business partnerships, and one of the leading experts on China's industrial and economic emergence, demonstrates that the wave of the future is cooperation between the two titans, not conflict-and how America will benefit from increased economic engagement and competition with China. Focusing on several key areas of conflict and mutual interest, Jones details what American businesses and policy-makers must do to keep pace with China's private and state-owned corporations. Filled with sharp observations and cutting-edge research, ChinAmerica is the most comprehensive look yet at the interdependency of the world's two leading powers. It is, in short, a book that will change minds about Sino-American relations.  Topics covered in ChinAmerica:  How CEOs have Replaced Generals ? The role of government in Chinese and U.S. industrial policy ? what Is China Today ? Chinese Economic Philosophies ? Predictions for the Chinese Economy ? Taiwan and Its Synergy with China ? Restructuring the U.S. to compete and collaborate with China. "

                "We live in a world drowning in objects. But what do they tell us about ourselves?In  The Language of Things , Deyan Sudjic charts our relationship - both innocent and knowing - with all things designed. From the opulent excesses of the catwalk, or the technical brilliance of a laptop computer, to the subtle refinement of a desk lamp, he shows how we can be manipulated and seduced by our possessions. Sudjic delivers an exhilarating insider's history of design as he introduces us to the world's most original innovators and reveals the hidden meanings in their work. How did the design of a pistol influence a car? Why did a chair make a cafe the most fashionable place in Paris? What can we learn from a banknote, a police uniform or a typeface? And why can't any of us decide what size to wear our trousers? In an age when the word 'designer' has become synonymous with the cynical and manipulative, Sudjic examines the qualities behind successful design and explores the conflicting tensions between high art and mass production. Brilliant and courageous,  The Language of Things  defines the visual vocabulary of our time and gives us a powerful new way of seeing the world. "

Her family's involvement with South London's criminal underworld left her isolated, vulnerable and lonely. Falling deeper and deeper into depression and despair - she snapped. Shelley got on the first coach out of London with only the clothes she stood up in and \u00a330 in her pocket. She didn't care where she was going, as long as she could disappear completely from her oppressive life. For years, she lived anonymously in refuges, hostels and on the streets. It would take something remarkable to bring her back to the real world. "

                "SeattleOil.com&#160; The Internet writings of John Michael Greer - beyond any doubt the greatest peak oil historian in the English language - have finally made their way into print. Greer fans will recognize many of the book's passages from previous essays, but will be delighted to see them fleshed out here with additional examples and analysis.The Long Descent is one of the most highly anticipated peak oil books of the year, and it lives up to every ounce of hype. Greer is a captivating, brilliantly inventive writer with a deep knowledge of history, an impressive amount of mechanical savvy, a flair for storytelling and a gift for drawing art analogies. His new book presents an astonishing view of our society's past, present and future trajectory--one that is unmatched in its breadth and depth. Reviewed by Frank Kaminski Wired.com&#160; The Long Descent is a welcome antidote to the armageddonism that often accompanies peak oil discussions. \"The decline of a civilization is rarely anything like so sudden for those who live through it\" writes Greer, encouragingly; it's \"a much slower and more complex transformation than the sudden catastrophes imagined by many soical critics today.\"The changes that will follow the decline of world petroleum production are likely to be sweeping and global, Greer concludes, but from the perspective of those who live through them these changes are much more likely to take gradual and local forms. Reviewed by Bruce Sterling Americans are expressing deep concern about US dependence on petroleum, rising energy prices, and the threat of climate change. Unlike the energy crisis of the 1970s, however, there is a lurking fear that now the times are different and the crisis may not easily be resolved. The Long Descent examines the basis of such fear through three core themes: Industrial society is following the same well-worn path that has led other civilizations into decline, a path involving a much slower and more complex transformation than the sudden catastrophes imagined by so many social critics today. The roots of the crisis lie in the cultural stories that shape the way we understand the world. Since problems cannot be solved with the same thinking that created them, these ways of thinking need to be replaced with others better suited to the needs of our time. It is too late for massive programs for top-down change; the change must come from individuals. Hope exists in actions that range from taking up a handicraft or adopting an &#8220;obsolete&#8221; technology, through planting an organic vegetable garden, taking charge of your own health care or spirituality, and building community. Focusing eloquently on constructive adaptation to massive change, this book will have wide appeal. "

It is a tombstone for my foster father who died of hunger in 1959, for the 36 million Chinese who also died of hunger, for the system that caused their death, and perhaps for myself for writing this book.'   The most powerful and important Chinese work of recent years, Yang Jisheng's Tombstone is a passionate, moving and angry account of one of the 20th century's most nightmarish events: the killing of an estimated 36 million Chinese in 1958-1961 by starvation or physical abuse. More people died in Mao's Great Famine than in the entire First World War and yet their story remains substantially untold. Now, at last, they can be heard.   Based on survivors' testimonies, this book was greeted with huge acclaim when published in Hong Kong as an essential work of reckoning.   'The man who exposed Mao's secret famine' Financial Times. "
