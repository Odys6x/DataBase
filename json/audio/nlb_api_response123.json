                "From the finance editor of  The New York Times , an examination of Bill Gates\u2014one of the most powerful, fascinating, and contradictory figures of the past four decades\u2014and an eye-opening exploration of our national fixation on billionaires.  Few billionaires have been in the public eye for as long, and in as many guises, as Bill Gates. At first heralded as a tech visionary, the Microsoft cofounder next morphed into a ruthless capitalist, only to change yet again when he fashioned himself into a global do-gooder. Along the way, Gates forever influenced how we think about tech founders, as the products they make and the ideas they sell continue to dominate our lives. Through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, he also set a new standard for high-profile, billionaire philanthropy. But there is more to Gates's story, and here, Das's revelatory reporting shows us that billionaires have secrets and philanthropy can have a dark side.    Drawing upon hundreds of interviews with current and former employees of the Gates Foundation, Microsoft, academics, nonprofits, and those with insight into the Gates universe, Das delves into Gates's relationships with Warren Buffett, Jeffrey Epstein, Melinda French Gates, and others, to uncover the truths behind the public persona. In telling Gates's story, Das also provides a new way to think about how billionaires wield their power, manipulate their image, and pursue philanthropy to become heroes, repair damaged reputations, and direct policy to achieve their preferred outcomes.   Insightful, illuminating, and timely,  Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King  is an important story of money and government, wealth and power, and media and image, and the ways in which the world's richest people hold us in their thrall.

                "Political disintegration is a persistent feature of world history.  The Collapse of Complex Societies , though written by an archaeologist, will therefore strike a chord throughout the social sciences. Any explanation of societal collapse carries lessons not just for the study of ancient societies, but for the members of all such societies in both the present and future. Dr. Tainter describes nearly two dozen cases of collapse and reviews more than 2,000 years of explanations. He then develops a new and far-reaching theory that accounts for collapse among diverse kinds of societies, evaluating his model and clarifying the processes of disintegration by detailed studies of the Roman, Mayan, and Chacoan collapses.   \u00a91988 Cambridge University Press. Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont. "

                "Flight, Flight, Mimic  is the first systematic study of deceptive mimicry in the context of wars. Deceptive mimicry\u2014the manipulation of individual or group identity\u2014includes passing off as a different individual, as a member of a group to which one does not belong, or, for a group, to \"sign\" its action as another group. Mimicry exploits the reputation of the model it mimics to avoid capture (flight), to strike undetected at the enemy (fight), or to hide behind or besmirch the reputation of the model group (\"false flag\" operations). These tactics have previously been described anecdotally, mixed in with other ruses de guerre, but the authors show that mimicry is a distinct form of deception with its own logic and particularly consequential effects on those involved. The book offers a theory and game-theoretic model of mimicry, an overview of its use through history, and a deep empirical exploration of its modern manifestations through several case studies by leading social scientists. The chapters cover mimicry in the context of the Northern Ireland conflict, terrorism campaigns in 1970s Italy, the height of the Iraq insurgency, the Rwandan genocide, the Naxalite rebellion in India, and jihadi discussion forums on the Internet.

                "Brought to you by Penguin.   Mother to five children, Clover Stroud has navigated family life across two decades, both losing and finding herself. In her touching, provocative and profoundly insightful book, she captures a sense of what motherhood really feels like \u2013 how intense, sensuous, joyful, boring, profound and dark it can be.  My Wild and Sleepless Nights  examines what it means to be a mother, and reveals with unflinching honesty the many conflicting emotions that this entails: the joy and the wonder, the loneliness and despair.  Charting the course of one year, the first in her youngest child's life, Clover searches for answers to questions that many of us would be too afraid to admit to \u2013 not only about motherhood, but also about female sexuality and identity. Her story will speak to all mothers, and anyone about to embark on that journey. 'Clover Stroud is a remarkable woman, and an incredible writer.' - Bryony Gordon 'Clover Stroud is a force of nature.' Elizabeth Gilbert \u00a9 Clover Stroud 2020 (P) Penguin Audio 2020. "

                "Explores the intellectual history of Americans' divergent assumptions about God, nature, and science.  Humankind has always wrestled with the existence of suffering. For two centuries, many American ministers, physicians, and scientists believed that an omnipotent and omniscient God created the world such that people might relieve suffering through ingenuity and learning. Others responded to the new worldview introduced by the scientific revolution as a threat to the divine order. In  Imagining Progress , Kristin Johnson traces the history of Americans' evolving relationship with science and religion at \"one of its most dramatic places\"\u2014the bedsides of dying children. It's here that she illuminates diverging assumptions about God, nature, and history. From Cotton Mather's campaign for smallpox inoculation to battles over teaching evolution in the 1920s, Johnson adroitly weaves an interdisciplinary history of medicine, science, theology, and activism. She follows a wide cast of characters from across theological, scientific, and political spectrums. What emerges is a portrait of diverse, often contradictory hopes and anxieties inspired by new theories of nature and human existence. Johnson also discerns a problematic pattern of invoking science to ameliorate the suffering of some children while ignoring the suffering of others. "

                "A fascinating investigation into the lucrative, minimally regulated, fast-growing industry of egg freezing, from a young reporter on a personal journey into the world of cutting-edge reproductive medicine    \u201cAn engaging and groundbreaking book.\u201d\u2014Toni Weschler, MPH, author of  Taking Charge of Your Fertility   Ovaries. Most women have two; journalist Natalie Lampert has only one. Then, in her early twenties, she almost lost it, along with her ability to ever have biological children. Doctors urged her to freeze her eggs, and Lampert started asking questions.\u00a0  The Big Freeze  is the story of Lampert\u2019s personal quest to investigate egg freezing, as well as the multibillion-dollar femtech industry, in order to decide the best way to preserve her own fertility. She attended flashy egg-freezing parties, visited high-priced fertility clinics, talked to dozens of women who froze their eggs, toured the facility in Italy where the technology was developed, and even attended a memorial service for thousands of accidentally destroyed embryos.\u00a0 What was once science fiction is now simply science: Fertility can be frozen in time. Between 2009 and 2022, more than 100,000 women in the United States opted to freeze their eggs. Along with in vitro fertilization, egg freezing is touted as a way for women to \u201chave it all\u201d by conquering their biological clocks, in line with the global trend of delaying childbirth. A generation after the Pill, this revolutionary technology offers a new kind of freedom for women. But does egg freezing give women real agency or just the illusion of it? A personal and deeply researched guide to the pros, cons, and many facets of this wildly popular technology,  The Big Freeze  is a page-turning exploration of the quest to control fertility, with invaluable information that answers the questions women have been afraid to ask\u2014or didn\u2019t know they should ask in the first place.  * This audiobook edition includes\u00a0a downloadable PDF of notes and resources from the book.

                "A  Fortune  magazine journalist draws on his expertise and extensive contacts among the companies and scientists at the forefront of artificial intelligence to offer dramatic predictions of AI's impact over the next decade, from reshaping our economy and the way we work, learn, and create to unknitting our social fabric, jeopardizing our democracy, and fundamentally altering the way we think.  Within the next five years, Jeremy Kahn predicts, AI will disrupt almost every industry and enterprise, with vastly increased efficiency and productivity. It will restructure the workforce, making AI copilots a must for every knowledge worker. It will revamp education, meaning children around the world can have personal, portable tutors. It will revolutionize health care, making individualized, targeted pharmaceuticals more affordable. It will compel us to reimagine how we make art, compose music, and write and publish books. The potential of generative AI to extend our skills, talents, and creativity as humans is undeniably exciting and promising.   But while this new technology has a bright future, it also casts a dark and fearful shadow. AI will provoke pervasive, disruptive, potentially devastating knock-on effects. Leveraging his unrivaled access to the leaders, scientists, futurists, and others who are making AI a reality, Kahn will argue that if not carefully designed and vigilantly regulated AI will deepen income inequality, depressing wages while imposing winner-take-all markets across much of the economy. AI risks undermining democracy, as truth is overtaken by misinformation, racial bias, and harmful stereotypes. Continuing a process begun by the internet, AI will rewire our brains, likely inhibiting our ability to think critically, to remember, and even to get along with one another\u2014unless we all take decisive action to prevent this from happening.   Much as Michael Lewis's classic  The New New Thing  offered a prescient, insightful, and eminently readable account of life inside the dot-com bubble,  Mastering AI  delivers much-needed guidance for anyone eager to understand the AI boom\u2014and what comes next.

                "The first and definitive history of the use of food in United States law and politics as a weapon of conquest and control, a  Fast Food Nation  for the Black Lives Matter era   In 1779, to subjugate Indigenous nations, George Washington ordered his troops to \u201cruin their crops now in the ground and prevent their planting more.\u201d Destroying harvests is just one way that the United States has used food as a political tool. Trying to prevent enslaved people from rising up, enslavers restricted their consumption, providing only enough to fuel labor. Since the Great Depression, school lunches have served as dumping grounds for unwanted agricultural surpluses.  From frybread to government cheese,  Ruin Their Crops on the Ground  draws on over fifteen years of research to argue that U.S. food law and policy have created and maintained racial and social inequality. In an epic, sweeping account, Andrea Freeman, who pioneered the term \u201cfood oppression,\u201d moves from colonization to slavery to the Americanization of immigrant food culture, to the commodities supplied to Native reservations, to milk as a symbol of white supremacy. She traces the long-standing alliance between the government and food industries that have produced gaping racial health disparities, and she shows how these practices continue to this day, through the marketing of unhealthy goods that target marginalized communities, causing diabetes, high blood pressure, and premature death.   Ruin Their Crops on the Ground  is a groundbreaking addition to the history and politics of food. It will permanently upend the notion that we freely and equally choose what we put on our plates. "

                "How to reclaim power in a time of perpetual crisis  We are living through a Long Emergency: a near-continuous train of pandemics, heatwaves, droughts, resource wars, and other climate-driven disasters. In  Lifehouse , Adam Greenfield asks what might happen if the tactics and networks of care that spring up in response to these times might be brought together in a single, coherent way of life? Using examples from the Black Panthers' \"survival programs,\" the astonishingly effective Occupy Sandy disaster-relief effort, and the neighborhood-based mutual aid groups that sustained many during COVID lockdowns to the large-scale, self-organized polities of municipalist Spain and Kurdish Rojava, Greenfield argues for rethinking local power as a bulwark against despair\u2014a way to discover and develop the individual and collective capacities that have gone underutilized during all the long years of late capitalism, and a means for thriving in the face of impending catastrophe.

                "Visiting Martin Luther King Jr., at the peak of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott, journalist William Worthy almost sat on a loaded pistol. Just for self defense, King assured him. It was not the only weapon King kept for such a purpose; one of his advisors remembered the reverend's Montgomery, Alabama home as an arsenal.   Like King, many ostensibly nonviolent civil rights activists embraced their constitutional right to self-protection\u2014yet this crucial dimension of the Afro-American freedom struggle has been long ignored by history. In  This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed , civil rights scholar Charles E. Cobb Jr., describes the vital role that armed self-defense played in the survival and liberation of black communities in America during the Southern Freedom Movement of the 1960s. In the Deep South, blacks often safeguarded themselves and their loved ones from white supremacist violence by bearing\u2014and, when necessary, using\u2014firearms. In much the same way, Cobb shows, nonviolent civil rights workers received critical support from black gun owners in the regions where they worked. Whether patrolling their neighborhoods, garrisoning their homes, or firing back at attackers, these courageous men and women and the weapons they carried were crucial to the movement's success.   Giving voice to the World War II veterans, rural activists, volunteer security guards, and self-defense groups who took up arms to defend their lives and liberties,  This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed  lays bare the paradoxical relationshaip between the nonviolent civil rights struggle and the Second Amendment. Drawing on his firsthand experiences in the civil rights movement and interviews with fellow participants, Cobb provides a controversial examination of the crucial place of firearms in the fight for American freedom.   This audio edition is masterfully narrated by Leon Nixon, a listener favorite.   This audiobook was produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont \u00a92014 Charles E. Cobb Jr. (P) "

Is she talking fondly of dictators? Has she suddenly started quietly muttering in the Aldi queue about the \"Jewish Space Lasers\" she's heard are setting wildfires around the world to make sure everyone believes in climate change? When was the moment the world began to believe anything?  Danny Wallace, million-copy bestselling author of  Yes Man  and  Join Me , has fallen down the modern rabbit hole of lies, conspiracies and disinformation. Along the way, he encounters families torn apart by accusations and fake news, journalists putting themselves on the frontline of the disinformation war, reformed conspiracy theorists, influencers who see profit in stoking paranoia, and the shadowy nameless, faceless trolls on the other side of our screens. He discovers how disinformation and well-told lies can ruin a year or a whole life, how they can affect our family, our street, our community. How they can spread across a country, a continent, even the world. How they take hold of our imaginations and make us feel both helpless and powerful. And Danny asks: can you do anything to stop it \u2013 even with the truth on your side? \u00a92024 Danny Wallace (P)2024 Penguin Audio. "

                "This program is read by the author.    Barrett Brown went to prison for four years for leaking intelligence documents. He was released to Trump's America. This is his story.   After a series of escapades both online and off that brought him in and out of 4chan forums, the halls of power, heroin addiction, and federal prison, Barrett Brown is a free man. He was arrested for his part in an attempt to catalog, interpret, and disseminate top-secret documents exposed in a security lapse by the intelligence contractor Stratfor in 2011. An influential journalist who is also active in the hacktivist collective Anonymous, Brown recounts exploits from a life shaped by an often self-destructive drive to speak truth to power. With inimitable wit and style, palpable anger and conviction, he exposes the incompetence and injustices that plague media and politics, reflects on the successes and failures of the transparency movement, and shows the way forward in harnessing digital communication tools for collective action. But  My Glorious Defeats  is more than just the tale of the clever and hilarious Brown; it's also a rigorously researched dissection of our decaying institutions and of human nature itself. As Brown makes clear, institutions are made of people\u2014people with personal ambitions and personal vices\u2014and it is people, just like him, just like us, who hold power. As optimistic as it is heartbreaking,  My Glorious Defeats  is an entertaining and illuminating manual for insurgency in the information age.  A Macmillan Audio production from Farrar, Straus and Giroux. "

Instead of taking her school exams that week, Zara is put under a three-month siege, with her family and thousands of others fearing for their lives as Hindu neighbors, friends, and members of civil society transform overnight into bloodthirsty mobs, hunting and massacring their fellow citizens. The chief minister of the state at the time, Narendra Modi, will later be accused of fomenting the massacre, and yet a decade later, will rise to become India\u2019s prime minister, sending the \u201cworld\u2019s largest democracy\u201d hurtling toward cacophonous Hindu nationalism.\u00a0 \u00a0  The Lucky Ones  traces the past of a multigenerational Muslim family to India\u2019s brave but bloody origins, a segregated city\u2019s ancient past, and the lingering hurt causing bloodshed on the streets. Symphonic interludes offer glimpses into the precious, ordinary lives of Muslims, all locked together in a crumbling apartment building in the city\u2019s old quarters, with their ability to forgive and find laughter, to offer grace even as the world outside, and their place in it, falls apart. \u00a0  The Lucky Ones  entwines lost histories across a subcontinent, examines forgotten myths, prods a family\u2019s secrets, and gazes unflinchingly back at a country rushing to move past the biggest pogrom in its modern history. It is a warning thrown to the world by a young survivor, to democracies that fail to protect their vulnerable, and to homes that won\u2019t listen to their daughters. It is an ode to the rebellion of a young woman who insists she will belong to her land, family, and faith on her own terms. "

In  Bite , zoologist Bill Schutt makes a surprising case: it is teeth that are responsible for the long-term success of vertebrates. The appearance of teeth, roughly half a billion years ago, was an adaptation that allowed animals with backbones, such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, dinosaurs and mammals\u2014including us\u2014to chow down in pretty much every conceivable environment.  And it's not just food. Tusks and fangs have played crucial roles as defensive weapons\u2014glimpsing the upper canines of snarling dogs is all it takes to know that teeth are an efficient means of aggression. Vampire bats use their razor-sharp teeth to obtain a widespread but generally untappable resource: blood. Early humans employed their teeth as tools to soften tough fibers and animal hides. Our teeth project information and social status\u2014the ancient Etruscans were the first to wear tooth bling, and it's doubtful that George Washington would have been elected president without the false teeth he wore.  So much of what we know about life on this planet has come from the study of fossilized teeth, which have provided information not only about evolution but also about famine, war, and disease. In his signature witty style, the author of  Pump  and  Cannibalism  shows us how our continued understanding of teeth may help us humans through current and future crises, from Alzheimer's disease to mental health issues.  Bite  is popular science at its best and will appeal to readers of Mary Roach, Merlin Sheldrake, and Ed Yong. "

                "What would happen if policing disappeared?   Would we be safe?   This book imagines a world without police.    It's evident that policing is a problem. But what is the way best forward? In  Beyond Policing , distinguished scholar and writer Philip V. McHarris reimagines the world without police to find answers and reveal how we can make police departments obsolete.    Beyond Policing  tackles thorny issues with evidence, including data and personal stories, to uncover the weight of policing on people and communities and the patterns that prove police reform only leads to more policing.    McHarris challenges us to envision a future where safety is not synonymous with policing but is built on the foundation of community support and preventive measures. He explores innovative community-based safety models (like community mediators and violence interrupters), the decriminalization of driving offenses, and the creation of nonpolice crisis response teams. McHarris also outlines strategies for responding to conflict and harm in ways that transform the conditions that give rise to the issues. He asks us to imagine a world where people thrive without the shadow of inequality, where our approach to safety is a collective achievement.    McHarris writes, \"What if our response to crisis wasn't about control but about care? How can we create conditions where safety is a shared responsibility? How can we design justice so that no community is routinely oppressed? Envisioning such a world isn't just a daydream; it's the first step toward building a society where violence and fear no longer dictate our lives.\"    Transformative and forward thinking,  Beyond Policing  provides a blueprint for a brighter, safer world. McHarris's vision is clear: we must dare to move beyond policing and foster a society where everyone has the resources to thrive and feel safe. "

                "The riveting story of five families shattered by pernicious, pervasive conspiracy theories, and how we might set ourselves free from a crisis that could haunt American life for generations.   \u201cCompassionate, wise, and thoroughly reported\u00a0. . . one of the defining books of our time.\u201d\u2014Johann Hari,  New York Times  bestselling author of  Magic Pill    \u201cSHED MY DNA\u201d: three excruciating words uttered by a QAnon-obsessed mother, once a highly respected lawyer, to her only son, once the closest person in her life. QAnon beliefs and adjacent conspiracy theories have had devastating political consequences as they\u2019ve exploded in popularity. What\u2019s often overlooked is the lasting havoc they wreak on our society at its most basic and intimate level\u2014the family.\u00a0 In  The Quiet Damage , celebrated reporter Jesselyn Cook paints a harrowing portrait of the vulnerabilities that have left so many of us susceptible to outrageous falsehoods promising order, purpose, and control. Braided throughout are the stories of five American families: an elderly couple whose fifty-year romance takes a heartbreaking turn; millennial sisters of color who grew up in dire poverty\u2014one to become a BLM activist, the other, a hardcore conspiracy theorist pulling her little boy down the rabbit hole with her; a Bay Area hippie-type and her business-executive fianc\u00e9, who must decide whether to stay with her as she turns into a stranger before his eyes; evangelical parents whose simple life in a sleepy suburb spirals into delusion-fueled chaos; and a rural mother-son duo who, after carrying each other through unspeakable tragedy, stop speaking at all as ludicrous untruths shatter a bond long thought unbreakable. Charting the arc of each believer\u2019s path from their first intersection with conspiracy theories to the depths of their cultish conviction, to\u2014in some cases\u2014their rejection of disinformation and the mending of fractured relationships, Cook offers a rare, intimate look into the psychology of how and why ordinary people come to believe the unbelievable. Profound, brilliantly researched, and beautifully written,  The Quiet Damage  lays bare how we have been taken hostage by grifters peddling lies built on false hope\u2014and how we might release our loved ones, and ourselves, from their grasp.

                "A searing critique of the disability rights movement from within, and a call for collective liberation that is pro-Black and centers disabled people of color  For over twenty years, Dara Baldwin has often been the only person of color in the room when significant disability policy decisions are made. Disenfranchisement of people of color and multi-marginalized communities within the disability rights community is not new and has left many inside the community feeling frustrated and erased. In  To Be a Problem , Baldwin candidly shares her journey to becoming a disability activist and policymaker in DC while critiquing the disability rights community. She reveals the reality of erasure for many Black people and people of color in the disability movement and argues that, in turn, many white disabled people center themselves within the work without addressing their own white privilege. Disability rights groups have been centering white, straight, cisgender people while racial justice groups often fail to center disabled people, leading many Black and Brown disabled people to start their own Disability Justice organizations. Drawing from her unique vantage point, Baldwin calls readers to understand the shortcomings of the disability rights movement while inspiring us to push all movements towards a more inclusive and authentic liberation.

                "Few women artists feature prominently in the history of art, and even fewer who are mothers. What can we learn about ambition, limitation, and creativity from women who persist in doing both? Forged in the stress of early motherhood,  The Mother Artist  explores the fraught yet generative ties between caregiving and creative practice. As a young mother working at a museum, essayist Catherine Ricketts began asking questions about the making of motherhood and the making of art. Now, with incantatory prose and an intuitive gaze, she twines intimate meditations on parenthood with studies of the work and lives of painters, writers, dancers, musicians, and other creatives. Ricketts takes listeners through the studios of mother artists, placing us in the company of women from the past and the present who persevere in both art and caregiving. We encounter Senga Nengudi's sculptures, which celebrate the pregnant body, and Toni Morrison's powerful writing on childbirth. We behold Joan Didion's meditations on maternal grief and Alice Neel's portraits of mothers and babies. And we observe the ambition of sculptor Ruth Asawa, the activism of printmaker Elizabeth Catlett, and the constancy of writer Madeleine L'Engle. This book is for mothers who aspire to make art, anyone eager to discover the stories of visionary women, and all who long for a revolution of tenderness. "

Stanley in  #BlackEducatorsMatter  constitute an unstinting exploration of the experiences of Black K\u201312 teachers in the United States. Spotlighting the invaluable work of Black educators, this volume reveals that although they are underrepresented in educational institutions, they have profound positive influence not only on students of color but also on school climate and on all of society. Contributions from both emerging and established scholars lay out the historical and contemporary issues that confront Black educators. Viewing this landscape through the lens of BlackCrit and other race-centric perspectives, the contributors critically frame and explicitly name the challenges. They make plain that a common thread in the Black experience in United States schools is antiblackness, which remains an endemic feature of United States society even as recent social justice campaigns and public discourse on Critical Race Theory have brought greater awareness to longstanding inequities. This work illuminates the efforts of Black educators to fight oppression and institutionalized racism in schools. It provides strategies that district and school leadership can adopt to recruit, retain, and support Black educators in schools. "

A renowned philosopher and advisor to NBC\u2019s  The Good Place  offers a thoughtful exploration of humanity\u2019s future\u2014or lack thereof.  \u00a0  \u201cFor more than five years, Todd May was my philosophical advisor. I heartily recommend that he be yours as well. (It helps that he\u2019s quite funny.)\u201d\u2014Michael Schur, from the Introduction  \u00a0 These days it\u2019s harder than ever to watch TV, scroll social media, or even just sit at home looking out of the window without contemplating the question at the heart of philosopher Todd May\u2019s  Should We Go Extinct?  Facing climate destruction and the revived specter of nuclear annihilation even as humans continue to cause untold suffering to our fellow creatures on planet Earth, we are forced each day to contemplate whether the world would be better off in our absence. \u00a0 In this timely, fascinating examination, May, a renowned philosopher and advisor to the acclaimed TV show  The Good Place , reasons both for and against the continuation of our species, trying to help us understand how and whether, the positive and negative tallies of the human ledger are comparable, and what conclusions we might draw about ourselves and our future from doing so. He discusses the value that only humans can bring to the world and to one another as well as the goods, like art and music, that would be lost were we no longer here. On the other side of the ledger, he walks us through the suffering we cause to nature and the non-human world, seeking to understand whether it\u2019s possible to justify such suffering against our merits and if not, what changes we could make to reduce the harm we cause.\u00a0 \u00a0 In this moment of rising pessimism about the future, and as many people wonder whether they should bring children into such a dark and difficult world, the questions May tackles in  Should We Go Extinct?  are hardly theoretical. As he explores the complexities involved with changes such as an end to factory farming, curbing scientific testing of animals, reducing the human population, and seeking to develop empathy with our fellow creatures, May sketches a powerful framework for establishing our responsibilities as a species and gives hope that we might one day find universal agreement that the answer to his title question should be  No .

                "From NYU professor of developmental psychology Niobe Way,     an in-depth exploration about what boys and young men teach us about themselves, us, and the toxic culture we have created, one in which we value money over people, toys over human connection, and academic achievement over kindness. Based on her longitudinal and mixed-method research over thirty-five years,  Rebels with a Cause  is a true call to action to change the culture so that we stop the vicious cycle of violence and blame.   \u00a0  Dr. Niobe Way has spent her career researching social and emotional development and finds that boys and young men desperately want and need the same thing as everyone else: close friendships. Yet they and we grow up in a stereotyped \u201cboy\u201d culture, one that devalues and mocks those relationships, rather than recognizing that they\u2019re necessary for human survival.  \u00a0  In  Rebels with a Cause , Way takes her message one step beyond her previous book,  Deep Secrets , which was the inspiration for an Oscar-nominated film  Close,  to reveal how these \u201crebels,\u201d as she calls the boys and young men in her research and in her classrooms, teach us about their and our crisis of connection, evidence of which is visible in our soaring rates of depression, anxiety, loneliness, suicide, and mass violence. They also teach us about the solutions to the crisis, which is to care, to listen with curiosity, and to take individual and collective responsibility for the damage we have done to them, to ourselves, and to the world around us.  \u00a0  Way provides us not only with data-driven insight into the roots and consequences of this crisis of connection, but also offers us concrete and empirically tested strategies for creating a culture that better aligns with our human nature and our human needs. Her book reminds us that \u201cit\u2019s not the rebels who cause the troubles of the world, it\u2019s the troubles that cause the rebels.\u201d The time to listen to and act on what young rebels have been telling us for almost a century is now.

From the country's founding through the summer of Black Lives Matter in 2020, David Mura unmasks how white stories about race attempt to erase the brutality of the past and underpin systemic racism in the present. Intertwining history, literature, ethics, and the deeply personal, Mura looks back to foundational narratives of white supremacy to show how white identity is based on shared belief in the pernicious myths, false histories, and racially segregated fictions. White supremacy insists white knowledge is superior to Black knowledge, and this belief dismisses the truths embodied in Black narratives. In James Baldwin's essays, Mura finds a response to racial distortions and a way for Blacks and other BIPOC people to heal from the wounds of racism. Mura attends to the persistent trauma racism has exacted and lays bare how deeply we need to change our racial narratives to dissolve the myth of Whiteness and acknowledge the stories and experiences of Black Americans.

Yet our romantic lives are conspicuously absent from the media and cultural conversation. Sexual education does not typically address the specific information needed by disabled students. Mainstream dating apps fail to include disability as an aspect of one's identity alongside race, ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation. The few underutilized disability-focused apps are paternalistic and unappealing. Bestselling dating books do not address disability, and the few relationship books marketed to disabled people focus on the mechanics of sex rather than the complex interactions that create the conditions for it.  In  Dateable , disabled authors Jessica Slice Caroline Cupp team up to address the serious gap in the dating space.  Dateable  is the first book on disabled dating and relationships; it's a dating guide made especially for disabled and chronically ill people, that also calls in nondisabled readers. Jessica and Caroline take on everything from rom-com representation and dating apps to sex and breakups with a strong narrative underpinning and down-to-earth advice. The book is as much a practical tool as it is an empowering guide. "

What's gone wrong with our media? The answer: its owners. From William Randolph Hearst to Elon Musk, from the British press barons to colonial upstarts Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch, media proprietors have manipulated the news to accumulate wealth and influence as they meddled with democracy.   Eric Beecher knows the news business from bottom to top. He has been a journalist, editor and media proprietor (of Text Media and  Crikey ), with the rare distinction of having both worked for and been sued (unsuccessfully) by the Murdochs.   This book reveals the distorted role of the media moguls of the past two centuries: their techniques, strategies, behind-closed-doors machinations, and indulgent lifestyles. It explains how they have exploited the shield of the freedom of the press to undermine journalism \u2013 and truth.   In an era of fake news, AI and misinformation, this is democracy's chillingly important story: how a small coterie of flawed and narcissistic moguls created a shadow of power that has contributed to making the media an agent of mistrust.

Award-winning journalist and CNN correspondent Elle Reeve was not surprised by the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. With years of in-depth research and on-the-ground investigative reporting under her belt, Reeve was aware of the preoccupations of the online far right and their journey from the computer to QAnon, militias, and racist groups.   At the same time, Reeve saw a parallel growth of counterforces, with citizen vigilantes using new tools and tactics to take down the far right. This ongoing battle, long fought mainly on the internet, had arrived in the real world with greater and greater frequency.   With a sharp eye for detail and a dash of dark humor, Reeve explains the origins of this shocking sweep of political violence. Drawing on countless interviews with sources in the white nationalist movement as well as hundreds of as-yet-unseen documents, she takes us on a surreal journey from the darkest corners of the internet to the most significant and chilling scenes of real-world political violence in generations. A stranger-than-fiction odyssey into the dark heart of what American politics has become,  Black Pill  is necessary reading for any supporter of democracy. "

Consisting of longer articles providing overviews of important themes, supported by shorter papers focusing on material of particular interest, this comprehensive volume covers such wide-ranging topics as social institutions, spatial issues, the Viking Age economy, warfare, beliefs, language, voyages, and links with medieval and Christian Europe. This original work, specifically oriented towards a university audience and the educated public, will have a self-evident place as an undergraduate course book and will be a standard work of reference for all those in the field.

                "Howard Zehr is the father of restorative justice and is known worldwide for his pioneering work in transforming understandings of justice. Here he proposes workable principles and practices for making restorative justice possible in this revised and updated edition of his best-selling, seminal book on the movement. (The original edition has sold more than 110,000 copies.)   Restorative justice, with its emphasis on identifying the justice needs of everyone involved in a crime, is a worldwide movement of growing influence that is helping victims and communities heal, while holding criminals accountable for their actions.   This is not soft-on-crime, feel-good philosophy, but rather a concrete effort to bring justice and healing to everyone involved in a crime. In  The Little Book of Restorative Justice , Zehr first explores how restorative justice is different from criminal justice. Then, before letting those appealing observations drift out of reach into theoretical space, Zehr presents restorative justice practices. Zehr undertakes a massive and complex subject and puts it in graspable form, without reducing or trivializing it.    The Little Book of Restorative Justice  is wonderfully read by Karen Chilton, the acclaimed narrator of  The New Jim Crow . This resource is suitable for academic classes and workshops, for conferences and trainings, as well as for the layperson interested in understanding this innovative and influential movement.

In 1923, in response to the fatal shooting of four policemen, the mayor of Johnstown ordered every African American and Mexican immigrant who had lived in the city for less than seven years to leave. They were given less than a day to move or would face crippling fines or jail time and were forced out at gunpoint. An estimated two thousand people uprooted their lives in response to the racist edict. Area Ku Klux Klan members celebrated the creation of a \"sundown town\" and increased their own intimidation practices. Figures such as Marcus Garvey spoke out in Pittsburgh against it as newspapers throughout the country published condemnations. "

                "These are the architects of the modern civil rights movement: 4 profiles of revolutionary groups making change beyond protest A radically different approach to sustaining social justice movements\u20144 strategies for abolition and liberation from the new architects of the modern civil rights movement   Many of us think, I don\u2019t support the police. But what should take their place?  Or:  Prisons don\u2019t keep us safe. But what new systems could?  A lot of books about racial justice ask us how we got here, but   Reimagining the Revolution   is different: award-winning journalist and activist Paula Lehman-Ewing presents an inside-access look at the activists redefining where we  go  from here. Readers will hear from:   Ivan Kilgore , an incarcerated activist who founded the 501c3 nonprofit United Black Family Scholarship Foundation from behind prison walls   Critical Resistance , one of the oldest grassroots organizations in the nation working to dismantle the prison-industrial complex  The co-founders of  Greenwood , a Black-owned financial technology institution designed specifically for Black and Latino people and businesses:  Michael Render,  aka  Killer Mike, Amb. Andrew Young and Ryan Glover   Incarcerated activist  Heshima Denham  on his grassroots efforts to build a society for Black and Brown people independent of the state\u00a0   The Movement for Black Lives, the Alliance for Safety and Justice, BYP 100 , and  8toAbolition    Incarcerated and formerly incarcerated artists  using art to heal from trauma, connect with other incarcerated people, and amplify abolitionist change  Lehman-Ewing frames each profile within two fundamental truths: The current system\u2014built and sustained by oppression, extraction, and inequity by design\u2014cannot be reformed. And, knowing this, we need abolition; we need creative solutions designed by the people most impacted by the systems they fight to change.   Reimagining the Revolution   is a call to action for each of us: if we can access the tools we have, we can dream bigger, think outside the box, and follow the paths laid out by change-making activists toward nothing short of revolution.

                "On his death in the autumn of 2006, Milton Friedman was lauded as \"the grandmaster of free-market economic theory in the postwar era\" by the  New York Times  and \"the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century\" by the  Economist . Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, Friedman was both a highly respected economist and a prominent public intellectual, the leader of a revolution in economic and political thought that argued robustly in favor of virtues of free markets and laissez-faire policies.  Milton Friedman on Economics: Selected Papers  collects a variety of Friedman's papers on topics in economics that were originally published in the  Journal of Political Economy . Opening with Friedman's 1977 Nobel Lecture, the volume spans nearly the whole of his career, incorporating papers from as early as 1948 and as late as 1990. An excellent introduction to Friedman's economic thought,  Milton Friedman  will be essential for anyone tracing the course of twentieth-century economics and politics. "

                "Groundbreaking look at slaves as commodities through every phase of life, from birth to death and beyond, in early America  In life and in death, slaves were commodities, their monetary value assigned based on their age, gender, health, and the demands of the market.  The Price for Their Pound of Flesh  is the first book to explore the economic value of enslaved people through every phase of their lives\u2014including preconception, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, the senior years, and death\u2014in the early American domestic slave trade. Covering the full \u201clife cycle,\u201d historian Daina Ramey Berry shows the lengths to which enslavers would go to maximize profits and protect their investments. Illuminating \u201cghost values\u201d or the prices placed on dead enslaved people, Berry explores the little-known domestic cadaver trade and traces the illicit sales of dead bodies to medical schools. This book is the culmination of more than ten years of Berry\u2019s exhaustive research on enslaved values, drawing on data unearthed from sources such as slave-trading records, insurance policies, cemetery records, and life insurance policies. Writing with sensitivity and depth, she resurrects the voices of the enslaved and provides a rare window into enslaved peoples\u2019 experiences and thoughts, revealing how enslaved people recalled and responded to being appraised, bartered, and sold throughout the course of their lives. Reaching out from these pages, they compel the reader to bear witness to their stories, to see them as human beings, not merely commodities. A profoundly humane look at an inhumane institution,  The Price for Their Pound of Flesh  will have a major impact how we think about slavery, reparations, capitalism, nineteenth-century medical education, and the value of life and death.

                "Based on extensive interviews and archival material, The First Wave tells the story of the opposition in Singapore in its critical first thirty years in Parliament. Democratisation has been described to occur in waves. The first wave of a democratic awakening in post-independence Singapore began with J. B. Jeyaretnam's victory in the Anson by-election of 1981. That built up to the 1984 general election, the first of many to be called a \"watershed\", in which Chiam See Tong was also elected in Potong Pasir. After their successes in 1991, the opposition began dreaming of forming the government. But their euphoria was short-lived. Serious fault lines in the leading Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) rose to the surface almost immediately after the opposition victories of 1991, and the party was wiped out of Parliament by 1997. The opposition spent the next decade experimenting with coalition arrangements, to work their way back to victory. \u00a9 2019 by Loke Hoe Yeong.

                "What is poverty? What is inequality? How are they connected? How are they reproduced? How might they be overcome? Why should we try? The way we frame our questions shapes the way we see solutions. This book does what appears to be a no-brainer task, but one that is missing and important: it asks readers to pose questions in different ways, to shift the vantage point from which they view 'common sense,' and in so doing, to see themselves as part of problems and potential solutions. This is a book about how seeing poverty entails confronting inequality. It is about how acknowledging poverty and inequality leads to uncomfortable revelations about our society and ourselves. And it is about how once we see, we cannot, must not, unsee. This New Edition of This Is What Inequality Looks Like by Teo You Yenn features a new Afterword by the author, and a Foreword by Kwok Kian Woon, Professor of Sociology at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. \u00a9 2018 by Teo You Yenn.

                "This program is read by the author and combines several original tracks from Jo\u00e9l Leon and his collaborators, Arthur Lewis and Trevon Squirewell, and a thought-provoking collection of essays.  Everything and Nothing at Once  is an all-encompassing audio experience.    For readers of  Heavy ,  Punch Me Up to The Gods , and  A Little Devil in America , a beautiful, painful, and soaring tribute to everything that Black men are and can be.  Growing up in the Bronx, Jo\u00e9l Leon was taught that being soft, being vulnerable, could end your life. Shaped by a singular view of Black masculinity espoused by the media, by family and friends, and by society, he learned instead to care about the gold around his neck and the number of bills in his wallet. He absorbed the \"facts\" that white was always right and Black men were seen as threatening or great for comic relief but never worthy of the opening credits. It wasn't until years later that Jo\u00e9l understood he didn't have to be defined by these things. Now, in a collection of wide-ranging essays, he takes readers from his upbringing in the Bronx to his life raising two little girls of his own, unraveling those narratives to arrive at a deeper understanding of who he is as a son, friend, partner, and father. Traversing both the serious and lighthearted, from contemplating male beauty standards and his belly to his decision to seek therapy to the difficulties of making co-parenting work, Jo\u00e9l cracks open his heart to reveal his multitudes. \"I learned that being Black is an all-encompassing everything...To be Black, to be a Black man in the era I grew up in, was easily everything and nothing at once.\" Crafted like an album, each essay is a single that stands alone yet reverberates throughout the entire collection. Pieces like \"How to Make a Black Friend.\" consider challenging, delightful and absurd moments in relationships, while others like \"Sensitive Thugs All Need Hugs\" and \"All Gold Everything\" ponder the collective harms of society's lens. With incisive, searing prose,  Everything and Nothing at Once  deconstructs what it means to be a Black man in America.  A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt & Company. "

                "Brought to you by Penguin.  Sound Tracks  tells the history of our relationship with music in 60 detective stories, each focusing on the discovery of a musical instrument in archaeological digs around the world.  Taking us from the present day back to the dawn of time, long-lost music is here reconstructed as we enter the worlds of its makers. We feel a child's delight at playing with a water-filled pot that chirps like a bird in Peru in 700 AD; we appreciate the challenge of a soldier sending signals by trumpet along Hadrian's Wall; we hear the chiming of 64 bells buried in a tomb in 5th century China. Graeme Lawson leads us on a grand tour of the world's greatest musical discoveries, revealing that music is part of our DNA - not just in its role as pastime, entertainment or religious expression but also in how we commemorate our pasts and communicate with each other. It shapes all our lives and identities. Filling past silences with a treasure hoard of forgotten sounds and voices,  Sound Tracks  is an enthralling, astonishing alternative history of humanity. \u00a92024 Graeme Lawson (P)2024 Penguin Audio.

                "In the tradition of Elizabeth Kolbert and Michael Pollan, The Nature of Our Cities is a stirring exploration of how innovators from around the world are combining urban nature with emerging technologies, protecting the planet's cities from the effects of climate change and safeguarding the health of their inhabitants.   We live in an age when humanity spends 90% of its time indoors, yet the nature around us\u2014especially in America's cities\u2014has never been more vital. This distancing from nature has sparked crises in mental health, longevity, and hope for the next generation, while also heightening the risks we face from historic floods, heatwaves, and wildfires. Indeed, embracing nature holds untapped potential to strengthen and fortify our cities, suburbs, and towns, providing solutions spanning flood preparation, wildfire management, and promoting longevity. As ecological engineer Dr. Nadina Galle shows in The Nature of Our Cities nature is our most critical infrastructure for tackling the climate crisis. It just needs a little help.   A fellow at MIT's Senseable City Lab and selected for Forbes' 30 under 30 list, Galle is at the forefront of the growing movement to fuse nature and technology for urban resilience. In  THE NATURE OF OUR CITIES , she embarks on a journey as fascinating as it is pressing, showing how scientists and citizens from around the world are harnessing emerging technologies to unlock the power of the natural world to save their cities, a phenomenon she calls the \"Internet of Nature.\" Traveling the globe, Galle examines how urban nature, long an afterthought for many, actually points the way toward a more sustainable future. She reveals how technology can help nature navigate this precarious moment with modern advances such as:  Laser-mapping that identifies at-risk neighborhoods to fight deadly health disparities  A.I.-powered robots that prevent wildfires from reaching urban areas  Intelligent water gardens that protect cities from floods and hurricanes  Advanced sensors that achieve 99% tree survival in dry, hot summers   Optimistic in spirit yet pragmatic in approach, Galle writes persuasively that the future of urban life depends on balancing the natural world with the technology that can help sustain it. By turns clear-eyed and lyrical,  THE NATURE OF OUR CITIES  marks the emergence of an invigorating, prescient new talent in nature writing. "

Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven audiobook offers clear, concrete language to introduce the concept of BODY LIBERATION. This audiobook serves to celebrate the uniqueness of your body and all bodies, and addresses the unfair rules and ideas that currently exist about bodies. It ends with motivational action points for making the world more fair for all! While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. "

When Reah Bravo began working at the  Charlie Rose  show, the open secret of Rose's conduct towards women didn't deter her from pursuing a position she thought could launch her career in broadcast journalism. She considered herself more than capable of handling any unprofessional behavior that might come her way. But she soon learned a devastating truth: we don't always react to abusive situations as we imagine we will.   When we live in a society where many feminist ideals are mainstream and women hold positions of power, how is it possible that sexual misconduct remains so prevalent? When many employers mandate trainings to prevent harassment of all kinds, why is workplace abuse still so rampant?   Weaving her own experience with those of other women and insights from experts, Bravo reveals the psychological and cultural forces that make us all enablers of a sexist and dangerous status quo. By bringing these hard truths into the light,  Complicit  charts an accessible path toward a better future. "

                "A sweeping, narrative history of Black wealth and the economic discrimination embedded in America's financial system.    The early 2020s will long be known as a period of racial reflection. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, Americans of all backgrounds joined together in historic demonstrations in the streets, discussions in the workplace, and conversations at home about the financial gaps that remain between white and Black Americans. This deeply investigated book shows the scores of setbacks that have held the Black-white wealth gap in place\u2014from enslavement to redlining to banking discrimination\u2014and, ultimately, the reversals that occurred in the mid-2020s as the push for racial equity became a polarized political debate.  Fifteen Cents on the Dollar follows the lives of four Black Millennial professionals and a banking company founded with the stated mission of closing the Black-white wealth gap. That company, known as Greenwood, a reference to the historic Black Wall Street district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, generated immense excitement and hope among people looking for new ways of business that might lead to greater equity. But the twists and turns of Greenwood's journey also raise tough questions about what equality really means.  Seasoned journalist-academics Louise Story and Ebony Reed present a nuanced portrait of Greenwood's founders\u2014the entertainment executive Ryan Glover; the Grammy-winning rapper Michael Render, better known as Killer Mike; and the Civil Rights leader and two-term Atlanta mayor, Andrew Young\u2014along with new revelations about their lives, careers, and families going back to the Civil War. Equally engaging are the stories of the lesser-known individuals\u2014a female tech employee from rural North Carolina trying to make it in a big city; a rising leader at the NAACP whose father is in prison; an owner of a BBQ stand in Atlanta fighting to keep his home; and a Black man in a biracial marriage grappling with his roots when his father is shot by the police.  In chronicling these staggering injustices, Fifteen Cents on the Dollar shows why so little progress has been made on the wealth gap and provides insights Americans should consider if they want lasting change.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

                "A groundbreaking redefinition of what it means to be healthy that introduces the need for social health\u2014the part of wellbeing that comes from feeling connected\u2014to truly flourish.   Exercise. Eat a balanced diet. Go to therapy. Most wellness advice is focused on achieving and maintaining good physical and mental health. But Harvard-trained social scientist and pioneering social health expert Kasley Killam reveals that this approach is missing a vital component: human connection.  Relationships not only make us happier, but also are critical to our overall health and longevity. Research shows that people with a strong sense of belonging are 2.6 times more likely to report good or excellent health. Perhaps even more astonishingly, people who lack social support are up to 53% more likely to die from any cause. Yet social health has been overlooked and underappreciated\u2014until now.  Just as we exercise our physical muscles, we can strengthen our social muscles. Weaving together cutting-edge science, mindset shifts, and practical wisdom, Killam offers the first methodology for how to be socially healthy. An antidote to the loneliness epidemic and an inspiring manifesto for seeing wellbeing as not only physical and mental, but also social, The Art and Science of Connection is a handbook for thriving.  In this essential book, you will:  Learn a simple yet powerful framework to understand, evaluate, and bolster your social health.  Discover the exact strategy or habit you need, as well as research-backed tips, to cultivate and sustain meaningful connection now and throughout your life.  Glean actionable insights to develop a sense of community in your neighborhood, at work, and online from a spirited group of neighbors in Paris, the CEO of a major healthcare company, and an artificially intelligent chatbot.  Get an insider look at the innovative ways that doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs, architects, government leaders, and everyday people are catalyzing a movement toward a more socially healthy society.  The Art and Science of Connection will transform the way you think about each interaction with a friend, family member, coworker, or neighbor, and give you the tools you need to live a more connected and healthy life\u2014whether you are an introvert or extrovert, if you feel stretched thin, and no matter your age or background. Along the way, Killam will reveal how a university student, a newlywed, a working professional, and a retired widow overcame challenges to thrive through connection\u2014and how you can, too.  Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. "

Jaime Rogozinski and Jordan Zazzara were not what anyone would mistake for traditional financial power players. But they turned WallStreetBets, a subreddit focused on risky financial trading, into one of the most disruptive forces to bubble up from the fringes of the internet. This crude and unassuming message board harnessed the power of memes and trolling to create a new kind of online community. The group intertwined with the distrust and turmoil of our times and spoke to a generation of young men who were struggling to find their place in the world.   Deeply reported and fast moving, The Trolls of Wall Street is the suspenseful story of the people who made and lost millions, battling with each other\u2014and with Wall Street\u2014for power and status. It is a sobering account of how millions of young Americans became obsessed with money and the markets, casting a long and lasting influence over finance, politics, and popular culture. "

We\u2019re too vast, too vibrant, and too complicated. As an adult, Golding begins to own her boldness, but growing up, she found herself \u201ckind of in the middle,\u201d fluctuating between not being the fly kid or the overachiever. Her debut collection of essays,  A Black Girl in the Middle , taps into life\u2019s wins and losses, representing the middle ground for Black girls and women. Golding packs humor, curiosity, honesty, anger, and ultimately acceptance in 12 essays spanning her life in Queens, NY, as a first-generation Jamaican American. She breaks down the 10 levels of Black Girl Math, from the hard glare to responses reserved for unfaithful boyfriends. She comes to terms with and heals from fraught relationships with her father, friends, and romantic partners. She takes the devastating news that she\u2019s a Black girl with a \u201cflat ass\u201d in stride, and adds squats to her routine, eventually. From a harrowing encounter in a hotel room leading her to explore celibacy (for now) to embracing rather than fearing the \u201cMilli Vanilli\u201d of emotions in hurt and anger, Golding embraces everything she\u2019s learned with wit, heart, and humility.  A Black Girl in the Middle  is both an acknowledgment of the complexity and pride of not always fitting in and validation of what Black girlhood and womanhood can be. "

But the systems were never truly dismantled in our country, leaving artifacts of injustice that continue to affect every aspect of life for Black and Brown Americans. \u00a0 Many of us feel overwhelmed by the problem, unsure how we can make a difference. Yet God calls the church to stand firmly committed to racial reconciliation\u2014and for each one of us to make choices that lead to healing. \u00a0 In  Brown Faces, White Spaces,  Latasha Morrison\u2014a speaker, bridge builder, and champion for unity\u2014explores nine aspects of American life where systemic racism still flourishes, including education, healthcare, the justice system, entertainment, and the church. Through story, historical context, and present realities, Morrison looks at what it means to recognize and confess the truth about inequities in the system (preparation), commit ourselves to changing the system (dedication), and move into true freedom as a society (liberation).\u00a0 \u00a0 Drawing on rich sociological insights, as well as experiences of family and friends and from her own life, Morrison asks:  How does knowing our country\u2019s history make a difference in how we live today? How does Jesus\u2019s divine act of reconciliation on the cross lead to human liberation from oppression? How might we create systems for all to flourish?  \u00a0 This honest, hope-filled book shows us how we can reform historically white spaces and create systems that work for the good of all. Join the bridge-building movement that is listening, learning, and working together for equity in every aspect of our lives.  Includes questions for personal reflection and group discussion. "

An inclusive and essential new resource for reproductive health\u2014including period problems, pelvic pain, menopause, fertility, sexual health, vaginal and urinary conditions, and overall wellbeing\u2014from leading expert and fierce advocate Dr. Karen Tang  Did you know that up to 90% of women experience menstrual abnormalities or pelvic issues in their lifetime? Yet these conditions are overwhelmingly misunderstood, misdiagnosed, or dismissed. The root causes for these issues, such as PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, PMDD, or pelvic floor dysfunction, don't receive the stream of funding for research and new treatments that other conditions do, despite affecting up to half the population. Dr. Karen Tang is on a mission to transform how we engage with our bodies and our healthcare.  It's Not Hysteria  is a comprehensive guide to common conditions and potential treatment options, with practical tools such as symptom prompts and sample questions for your provider, to equip readers to take control of their gynecologic health. Reproductive healthcare, from abortion to gender-affirming care, is under siege. The onus continues to fall on patients to find and advocate for the care they need. In the face of uncertainty and misinformation,  It's Not Hysteria  is destined to become a new classic that educates and empowers women and those assigned female at birth.

                "Drawing on archeological and ethno-historical evidence, Irving Rouse sketches a picture of the Tainos-the first people Columbus encountered when he arrived in the Americas-as they existed during the time of Columbus, contrasting their customs with those of their neighbors. He then moves backward in time to the ancestors of the Tainos-two successive groups who settled the West Indies and who are known to archeologists as the Saladoid peoples and the Ostionoid peoples. By reconstructing the development of these groups and studying their interaction with other groups during the centuries before Columbus, Rouse shows precisely who the Tainos were. He vividly recounts Columbus's four voyages, the events of the European contact, and the early Spanish views of the Tainos, particularly their art and religion. The narration shows that the Tainos did not long survive the advent of Columbus. Weakened by forced labor, malnutrition, and diseases introduced by the foreigners, and dispersed by migration and intermarriage, they ceased to exist as a separate population group. As Rouse discusses the Tainos' contributions to the Spaniards-from Indian corn, tobacco, and rubber balls to art, artifacts, and new words-we realize that their effect on Western civilization, brief through their contact, was an important and lasting one.

                "From the bestselling author of  Home Comforts  comes the story of our wedding vows\u2014what they mean and why they still matter.  In the West, marrying is so thoroughly identified with ceremonial promises that \"taking vows\" is a synonym for getting married. So, it's a surprise to realize that this custom is actually a historical and anthropological oddity. Most of the world, for most of history, married without making promises. And there's a reason for that. Marriage by vow presupposes free choice, and free choice makes a love-match possible. It is a very modern arrangement.    Vows  is both a moving memoir of two marriages and a thoughtful meditation on marriage itself. Cheryl Mendelson tackles the sociology of commitment through our most traditional promises and shows why they endure. In considering the kind of marriage these vows entail, she helps answer some of life's most urgent and personal of questions: Could I, would I, or should I make these promises to someone? Using history and literature, the book describes the parameters of the behavior that traditional vows promise and, in doing so, answers a whole series of other questions: Why did wedding-by-vow arise only in the West? Why are they recited in weddings around the world today? Why have these vows lasted for nearly a thousand years? Why does the kind of marriage promised in the vows survive?. "

                "A kick-in-the-pants wake-up call to start living meaningfully in light of how many Mondays you have left from longtime coach, positive psychology expert, and Penn Resilience Program instructor Jodi Wellman   How many Mondays do you have left?   Does that question send you into a panic spiral, or are you convinced that, unlike everyone in the history of life on earth, you will somehow avoid the tragic end and live to tell the tale? Statistically, we get about 4,000 Mondays in our lifetime, so if you're halfway through your life, you might have roughly 2,000 Mondays to go. The good news is that you are in charge of how you spend those days: toiling at a job you hate, or creating a career you love; scrolling mindlessly for hours a day, or pursuing the hobbies and travel that light you up; dreading the end, or living a full life that allows you to greet the Grim Reaper with a smile.  Built around the principles of positive psychology,  You Only Die Once  is the jolt that will bring you back to life, no near-death experience required. Full of practical takeaways and research-backed content, this book will motivate readers to take action on the life they  want  to be living, acting like a defibrillator for the soul. Accompanied by author Jodi Wellman's charming illustrations, this book won't lecture you about eating more kale or insist that the only path forward is to quit your job and move to Provence (although it's not  not  suggesting you do that either. The latter, that is. We'd never ask anyone to eat more kale.). Instead, it's a real-life guide to small changes that reawaken your passion and curiosity for life. Packed with inspiring stories, exercises, quizzes, quotes, and a step-by-step plan to awaken the liveliest version of you,  You Only Die Once  is the healthy dose of mortality you need to start living with urgency and meaning.

                "A  New York Times  investigative reporter wades into the murky, pixelated waters of the multibillion-dollar NFT market\u2014the virtual casino that sprang up overnight in 2020 and came crashing down, with all its celebrity hucksters, just two years later. A vibrant and witty exploration of the increasingly blurry line between art and money, artist and con artist, value and worthlessness. \u201cA perfect book to understand and to laugh at the craziness of the art world today.\" \u2014Jerry Saltz, author of  How to Be an Artist   In 2021, when the gavel fell at Christie\u2019s on the sale of Mike Winkelmann\u2019s  Everydays  series\u2014a compilation of five thousand digital artworks\u2014it made a thunderous announcement: Non-fungible tokens had arrived. The ludicrous world of  CryptoKitties  and Bored Apes had just produced a piece of art worth $69.3 million (at least according to the highest bidder). On that day, the traditional art market\u2014the largest unregulated market in the world\u2014put its stamp of approval on a very new and carnivalesque digital reality. But what did it mean for these two worlds to collide? Was it all just a money laundering scheme? And come on, what was that piece of digital flotsam  really  worth anyway? In  Token Supremacy,  Zachary Small works through these and other fascinating questions, tracing the crypto economy back to its origins in the 2008 financial crisis and the lineage of NFTs back to the first photographic negatives. Small describes jaw-dropping tales of heists, publicity stunts, and rug pulls, before zeroing in on the role of \"security tokens\" in the FTX scandal. Detours through art history provide insight into the mythmaking tactics that drive stratospheric auction sales and help the wealthy launder their finances (and reputations) through art.\u00a0And we cast an eye toward a future where NFTs have paved the way for a dangerous, new shadow banking system. A wild and spellbinding tour through a world that strains belief. "

McNeill's   Plagues and Peoples   is \"a brilliantly conceptualized and challenging achievement\" (Kirkus Reviews). Upon its original publication,  Plagues and Peoples   was an immediate critical and popular success, offering a radically new interpretation of world history. With the identification of AIDS in the early 1980s, another chapter was added to this chronicle of events, which William McNeill explores in his introduction to this edition. McNeill's highly acclaimed work is a brilliant and challenging account of the effects of disease on human history. His sophisticated analysis and detailed grasp of the subject make this book fascinating reading.   Thought-provoking, well-researched, and compulsively readable,   Plagues and Peoples   is essential reading\u2014that rare book that is as fascinating as it is scholarly, as intriguing as it is enlightening. This title is masterfully narrated by Douglas James. Produced and published by Echo Point Books & Media, an independent bookseller in Brattleboro, Vermont. "

And yet, no one asks kids what they think about these issues.  In Children of a Troubled Time, award-winning sociologist Margaret A. Hagerman amplifies the voices of children who grew up during Trump's presidency and explores how they learn about race in America today. Hagerman interviewed nearly fifty children between the ages of ten to thirteen in two dramatically different political landscapes: Mississippi and Massachusetts. Hagerman interviewed kids who identified as conservative and liberal in both places as well as kids from different racial groups. She discovered remarkably similar patterns in the ideas expressed by these children. Racism, she asserts, is not just a local or regional phenomenon: it is a broad American project affecting childhoods across the country.In Hagerman's emotionally compelling interviews, children describe what it is like to come of age during years of deep political and racial divide, and how being a kid during the Trump era shaped their views on racism, democracy, and America as a whole. Children's racialized emotions are also central to this book: disgust and discomfort, fear and solidarity, dominance and apathy.  As administrators, teachers, and parents struggle to help children make sense of our racially and politically polarized nation, Hagerman offers concrete examples of the kinds of interventions necessary to help kids learn how to become members of a multi-racial democracy and to avoid the development of far-right thinking in the white youth of today. Children of a Troubled Time expands our understanding of how the rising generation grapples with the complexities of racism and raises critical questions about the future of American society. "

                "From the leader of the online army in America's parental rights movement comes the real story of how moms and dads across the country are turning the tide against radical activists in public schools.   It's no secret that our government-run public education system has held generations of Americans hostage. The teachers unions\u2014the government's stormtroopers\u2014have been hard at work running a mass misinformation campaign to convince parents that because this is how it has always been, this is how it has to be. But here's what you may not realize: the parents are winning, and we have entered the death spiral of the education dictatorship. The school choice revolution is here, and moms and dads are successfully restoring parental rights in education, one state, one school district at a time.    In  The Parent Revolution , Dr. Corey A. DeAngelis\u2013public enemy #1 of the teachers' unions \u2013 takes readers inside this movement like no one else can. As Vox reported in late 2023, DeAngelis has become \"the public face\" of the effort, \"traveling from state to state, holding rallies, making media appearances, and tweeting constantly.\" Or as another education voice put it, \"No one in education policy, advocacy, or activism has ever lived rent-free in more heads at once than Corey DeAngelis.\"    As America's most prominent and influential advocate of school choice, DeAngelis unapologetically argues why parents and political leaders must lean into the culture war taking place in schools. He exposes the hypocritical elites who are content to hold other people's children captive to poorly run government schools while sending their own children to the best private and charter schools out there. And most importantly, he equips readers with the ability to make sure the potent forces of the educational industrial complex don't regain their footing. "

Vanatta shows how bankers created our credit card economy and, with it, the indebted nation we know today. America's consumer debt machine was not inevitable. In the years after World War II, state and federal regulations ensured that many Americans enjoyed safe banks and inexpensive credit. Bankers, though, grew restless amid restrictive rules that made profits scarce. They experimented with new services and new technologies. They settled on credit cards, and in the 1960s mailed out reams of high-interest plastic to build a debt industry from scratch. In the 1960s and 70s consumers fought back, using federal and state policy to make credit cards safer and more affordable. But bankers found ways to work around local rules. Beginning in 1980, Citibank and its peers relocated their card plans to South Dakota and Delaware, states with the weakest consumer regulations, creating \"on-shore\" financial havens and drawing consumers into an exploitative credit economy over which they had little control. We live in the world these bankers made. "

                "The inspiring story of a Black doctor who was deeply affected by the violence that plagued his Brooklyn childhood and later dedicated himself to addressing trauma and violence as public health issues  Rob Gore first encountered violence when he was beaten and robbed as a 10-year old; it was treated as an inevitable fact of life, but after another brush with violence as a teen, he began to reject that prevalent attitude. As he matured and became a doctor, he grew in his determination to find treatments for what he saw not as an unavoidable fact for most people living in vulnerable, underserved neighborhoods especially, but as a public health issue that could be addressed by early intervention and solid support, beginning in the medical community. He also became deeply involved in efforts to diversify the entire field of medicine, starting with the \u201cfront lines\u201d in the Emergency Department. Seeing his brother, Angel, and close friend, Willis, fall prey to the epidemic of violence with profound\u2014and in Willis\u2019s case\u2014deadly consequences, Rob began seriously researching the issue and went on to found an organization which is one of the models for successful approaches to reducing violence and protecting victims, who are disproportionately BIPOC, living in impoverished neighborhoods, or members of the LGBTQ+ community. Here he provides not only statistics, but stories of what he witnessed in NYC neighborhoods, in Atlanta, Chicago, Buffalo, and even in medical work in Haiti and Kenya. His work with the Kings Against Violence Initiate (KAVI) and allied organizations is a blueprint for treating violence not as a police matter, but as a public health crisis, which can and should be addressed and substantially reduced. The people he introduces us to in these pages are not merely victims, but often advocates, paving the way for eliminating the epidemic of violence in our country. "

                "The urgent, revelatory story of how a school board win for the conservative right in one Texas suburb inspired a Christian nationalist campaign now threatening to undermine public education in America\u2014from an NBC investigative reporter and co-creator of the Peabody Award\u2013winning and Pulitzer Prize finalist Southlake podcast.    Award-winning journalist Mike Hixenbaugh delivers the immersive and eye-opening story of Southlake, Texas, a district that seemed to offer everything parents would want for their children\u2014small classes, dedicated teachers, financial resources, a track record of academic success, and school spirit in abundance. All this, until a series of racist incidents became public, a plan to promote inclusiveness was proposed in response\u2014and a coordinated, well-funded conservative backlash erupted, lighting the fire of a national movement on the verge of changing the face of public schools across the country.  They Came for the Schools pulls back the curtain on the powerful forces driving this crusade to ban books, rewrite curricula, limit rights for minority and LGBTQ students\u2014and, most importantly, to win what Hixenbaugh's deeply informed reporting convinces is the holy grail among those seeking to impose biblical values on American society: school privatization, one school board and one legal battle at a time.  They Came for the Schools delivers an essential take on Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, as they demean public schools and teachers and boost the Christian right's vision. Hixenbaugh brings to light fascinating connections between this political and cultural moment and past fundamentalist campaigns to censor classroom lessons. Finally, They Came for the Schools traces the rise of a new resistance movement led by a diverse coalition of student activists, fed-up educators, and parents who are beginning to win select battles of their own: a blueprint, they hope, for gaining inclusive and civil schools for all.

When her beloved cousin was murdered just as both girls were entering adulthood, Dancyger\u2019s devotion to the women in her life took on a new urgency\u2014a desire to hold her friends close while she still could. In  First Love , this urgency runs through a striking exploration of the bonds between women, from the intensity of adolescent best friendship and fluid sexuality to mothering and chosen family. Each essay in this incisive collection   is grounded in a close female friendship in Dancyger\u2019s life, reaching outward to dissect cultural assumptions about identity and desire, and the many ways women create space for each other in a world that wants us small. Seamlessly weaving personal experience with literature and pop culture\u2014ranging from fairy tales to true crime, from Ana\u00efs Nin and Sylvia Plath to  Heavenly Creatures  and the \u201csad girls\u201d of Tumblr\u2014Dancyger\u2019s essays form a kaleidoscopic story of a life told through friendships, and an expansive interrogation of what it means to love each other. Though friendship will never be enough to keep us safe from the dangers of the world, Dancyger reminds us that love is always worth the risk, and that when tragedy strikes, it\u2019s our friends who will help us survive. In  First Love,  these essential bonds get their due. "

                "From the former heir apparent to White nationalism, an astonishing memoir of a childhood built on fear, and of breaking from a community of hateDerek Black was raised to take over the White nationalist movement in the United States. Derek's father, Don Black, was a former Grand Wizard in the Ku Klux Klan and started Stormfront, the internet's first White supremacist website\u2014Derek built the kids' page\u2014and David Duke was a mentor. Racist hatred, though often wrapped up in respectability and American history, was all Derek knew. It was their inheritance, their community, their identity. Then, while in college in 2013, Derek publicly renounced White nationalism and apologized for their actions and the suffering that they had caused. The majority of their family stopped speaking to Derek, and they disappeared into academia, convinced that they had done so much harm that there was no place for them in public life. But in 2016, as Derek watched the rise of Donald Trump, they recognized language and arguments they had once helped cultivate\u2014and they knew that they couldn't stay silent. The Klansman's Son is a thoughtful, insightful, and moving account of a singular life, with important lessons for our contentious times. The place where Derek's world turned upside down\u2014New College of Florida\u2014has become a prominent battleground in the fight over race, gender, and education, and few understand the ideology, motivations, or tactics of the White nationalist movement likeDerek. As coded language and creeping authoritarianism spread the ideas of White nationalists, this is an essential book from a powerful voice.\"Your family or your soul? That is what the choice finally came down to for Derek Black, whose searching memoir has much to teach us all. Surprises and insights abound in this page-turner composed with candor and grace. For instance, why do White power recruiters focus on those who say, 'I'm not a racist, but ... '? The Klansman's Son is a must-read for all who hunger for hope in these cruel times.\"\u2014Nancy MacLean, author of Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America and Behind the Mask of Chivalry: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan.

                "From one of the world's top experts on the economics of skyscrapers\u2014a fascinating account of the ever-growing quest for super tall buildings across the globe.   The world's skyscrapers have brought us awe and wonder, and yet they remain controversial\u2014for their high costs, shadows, and overt grandiosity. But, decade by decade, they keep getting higher and higher. What is driving this global building spree of epic proportions? In  Cities in the Sky , author Jason Barr explains all: why they appeal to cities and nations, how they get financed, why they succeed economically, and how they change a city's skyline and enable the world's greatest metropolises to thrive in the 21st century.   From the Empire State Building (1,250 feet) to the Shanghai Tower (2,073 feet) and everywhere in between, Barr explains the unique architectural and engineering efforts that led to the creation of each. Along the way, Barr visits and unpacks some surprising myths about the earliest skyscrapers and the growth of American skylines after World War II, which incorporated a new suite of technologies that spread to the rest of the world in the 1990s. Barr also explores why London banned skyscrapers at the end of the 19th century but then embraced them in the 21st and explains how Hong Kong created the densest cluster of skyscrapers on the planet. Also covered is the dramatic result of China's \"skyscraper fever\" and then on to the Arabian Peninsula to see what drove Dubai to build the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, which at 2,717 feet, is higher than the new One World Trade Center in New York by three football fields.   Filled with fascinating details for urbanists, architecture buffs, and urban design enthusiasts alike,  Cities in the Sky  addresses the good, bad, and ugly for cities that have embraced vertical skylines and offers us a glimpse to the future to see whether cities around the world will continue their journey ever upwards.

                "Barbie is a strong, independent doll. But is she a feminist icon? It's complicated. Since her introduction in 1959, Barbie's impact has been revolutionary. Far from being a toy designed by men to oppress women, she was a toy invented by women to teach women what was expected of them, for better or for worse. Whether tarred-and-glittered as antifeminist puffery or celebrated as a feminist icon (or, at any rate, an important cultural touchstone in understanding feminism), Barbie has undeniably influenced generations of girls. In Forever Barbie, cultural critic, investigative journalist, and first-generation Barbie owner M. G. Lord uncovers the surprising story behind Barbie's smash success. Revealing her low origins as \"Bild Lilli,\" a risqu\u00e9 doll for adults sold as a gag gift in postwar Germany, Forever Barbie traces Barbie's development and transformation, through countless makeovers and career changes, into an international pop culture icon and now \"traditional toy.\" Though not every doll in the line has been a hit\u2014with pregnant Midge and Growing up Skipper among the more intriguing disasters\u2014Barbie's endurance, Lord writes, speaks as much to Mattel's successful marketing as it does to our society's overall ambivalence toward femininity. With new accessories, including a preface on the latest developments in the Barbieverse, Forever Barbie \"will make you think of America's most celebrated plastic doll in ways you never have before\" (Susan Faludi).

                "Representations of Blackness have always been integral to our understanding of of the modern world. In Black Meme, Legacy Russell, author of Glitch Feminism, explores the construct, culture, and material of the \"meme\" as mapped to Black visual culture from 1900 to present day. Mining archival and contemporary media Russell explores the impact of Blackness, Black life, and death on contemporary conceptions of viral culture, borne in the age of the internet. These meditations include: the circulation of Lynching postcards; Jet magazine's publication of a picture of Emmett Till in his open casket; how the televised broadcast of protesters in Selma enters the nation's living room and changed the debate on civil rights; how a citizen-recorded video of the Rodney King beating at the hands of the LAPD became known as the \"first viral video\"; what the Anita Hill hearings tell us about the media's creation of the Black icon; Tamara Lanier's fight to reclaim the photos of her enslaved ancestors, Renty and Delia, from Harvard's archive; the Facebook Live recording by Lavish \"Diamond\" Reynolds of the murder of her partner Philando Castile by the police after being stopped for a broken tail light; and more. Legacy Russell explores the power of these tokens and argues that without the contributions of Black people, digital culture would not exist in its current form. "

                "A manual for every woman who wants to stop endless negative self-talk, create unshakable confidence, and jump-start a life of joy and power. It all begins with your thoughts.   I never look good in tight skirts. I can\u2019t ask for a raise or my boss will think I\u2019m greedy. I\u2019m getting too old to find a partner. I\u2019m a bad mom. I\u2019m always behind. I\u2019ll never be good enough.  What if every time you had a self-critical thought, you heard it in a man\u2019s voice? The truth is not far off. Living in a patriarchy, women absorb a lifetime of messages that say your worth is defined by your looks, your accomplishments, and how well you take care of everyone around you. In fact, these messages are so pervasive that, even knowing they exist, they still manage to program themselves into our brains. The result is that women end up feeling anxious, guilty, and vaguely ashamed of themselves no matter how much they do for others or achieve for themselves. So how do we deprogram our thoughts from patriarchy\u2019s corrosive influence? And once we do, how can we create new, self-empowering beliefs? Master Certified Life Coach and host of the  UnF*ck Your Brain  podcast Kara Loewentheil knows how. Despite graduating from Harvard Law School and getting her dream job, Kara spent her twenties and thirties feeling insecure and anxious, until she learned how to change her thoughts\u2014which led her to become a coach. In  Take Back Your Brain , she draws on cognitive psychology, feminist theory, and years of experience as a neuroplasticity-focused coach to break down how the patriarchy hijacks women\u2019s brains, and how women can get free. To bridge the gap between your inner voice and your true potential, she says, you must begin with your thoughts. By using the skills in this book to literally rewire your brain, you can create new thought patterns that will directly transform outcomes in your life. Ultimately,  Take Back Your Brain  invites you to replace the thoughts that no longer serve you and make room for a kind of confidence you never thought possible. Because when women unleash their true power, they awaken new possibilities for the world.  *\u00a0This audiobook edition includes a downloadable PDF that contains a QR code for access to the free  Take Back Your Brain  exercises guide.

                "Journalist Josiah Bates pulls back the curtain on a crisis that continues to plague the United States in this gripping narrative. Fueled by the convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest, gun violence has surged to unprecedented levels, devastating marginalized communities and urban areas across the nation. Bates embarks on a heart-wrenching journey, crisscrossing the country to meet victims, perpetrators, community activists, and renowned scholars. Through their powerful stories, he unearths the hidden causes behind the escalating gun violence epidemic. From the corrosive effects of poverty to the contentious debates surrounding policing and calls to defund law enforcement, Bates fearlessly navigates the intricate web of factors influencing gun violence. Through firsthand accounts and expert analysis, he exposes the systemic failures that perpetuate this cycle of destruction and delivers a powerful clarion call for change. Bates amplifies rarely heard voices in this debate, including both victims and perpetrators of shootings, some of whom now work tirelessly to dismantle the violence in their communities. Their stories, alongside Bates's unflinching reporting, illuminate a path toward long-term solutions. As the nation grapples with this relentless epidemic, Bates presents a compelling case for unity and action. In These Streets is a groundbreaking investigation that uncovers the deep-rooted causes of gun violence, empowering readers with the knowledge, empathy, and inspiration needed to drive meaningful transformation.\"If you want to understand gun violence but don't know where to start, start here. Josiah Bates brings together gripping stories, solid research, and astute analysis\u2014all in clear, readable language. By approaching violence as a problem to be solved and not an argument to be won, Bates leaves us with something in short supply these days: hope.\"\u2014Thomas Abt, author of Bleeding Out: The Devastating Consequences of Urban Violence\u2014and a Bold New Plan for Peace in the Streets.

In  Relentless , he shares a fascinating narrative of his life and career\u2014from his early days as a radically minded Puerto Rican activist to his decades of political advice and problem-solving.

Amid the triumphs and challenges, Miranda examines what his experience reveals about our ever-changing politics, demographics, and society. "

After a constable accosts them and charges them with begging, they end up in court, where national newspapers pick up their story. Are the girls truly escaped slaves from Kentucky? Or will the city's dystopian Mendicity Society catch them in a lie, exposing them as born-and-raised Londoners and endangering their safety?With its many accounts of people like these who lived and made their living on the streets, Vagabonds forms a moving picture of London's most compelling period (1780\u20131870). Piecing together contemporary sources such as newspaper articles, letters, and journal entries, historian Oskar Jensen follows the harrowing, hopeful journeys of the city's poor: children, immigrants, street performers, thieves, and sex workers, all diverse in gender, ethnicity, ability, and origin. For the first time, their own voices give us a radical new perspective on this moment in history, with its deep inequality that bears an astonishing resemblance to our own era's divides. "

                "America's most sought-after voice in the fight to save female sports shares her unbelievable story and inspires readers to embrace common sense and truth in discussions about women's rights.    Riley Gaines has been called many things: Collegiate athlete. All-American. Champion. But in 2022, everything changed. The narrative shifted. Now, critics smeared her as: Transphobic. Narrow-minded. Evil.    What changed? Riley gave the truth a voice. She stood up, spoke out, and dared to ask questions \u2014 not just for herself, but for all female athletes who refuse to accept an ideology where \"inclusivity\" for trans-identifying male athletes now means treating women unfairly.    Riley Gaines is changing minds in the process, and this highly anticipated, fearless, pro-woman book takes on controversial but critical questions we must confront about women (and sports) in America. Can't we embrace policies that give everyone the chance to compete but still protect women and ensure they have a fair shot at success?    In this book, Riley scrutinizes the perspectives of athletes on the opposing side of this debate, deconstructing their arguments with science, facts, and logic. She also asks what has happened to free speech and dissent in this country, where it now seems nearly impossible to have a well-reasoned debate. And in telling her story, Riley reveals what's at stake if the truth-seekers remain silent about the injustices women face from radical agendas. "

                "A short introduction to Black Humanism: its history, its present, and the rich cultural sensibilities that infuse it  In the United States, to be a Black American is to be a Black Christian. And there\u2019s something to this assumption in that the vast majority of African Americans are Christian. However, in recent years a growing number of African Americans have said they claim no particular religious affiliation\u2014they are Black \u201cnones.\u201d And of these Black \u201cnones,\u201d the most public and vocal are those who claim to be humanists. What does it mean to be a Black humanist? What do Black humanist believe, and what do they do? This slim volume answers these questions. Animated by 6 central principles, and discussed in terms of its history, practices, formations, and community rituals, this book argues that Black humanism can be understood as a religious movement. Pinn makes a distinction between theism and religion\u2014which is simply a tool for examining, naming, and finding the meaning in human experience. Black humanism, based on this definition isn\u2019t theistic but it is a religious system used to explore human experience and foster life meaning. It infuses humanism with rich cultural sensibilities drawn from Black experience. As shown in these pages, thinking about Black humanism this way frees readers from making unfounded assumptions and enables them to better appreciate the secular \u201cbeliefs,\u201d ritual structures, and community formation constituted by Black humanists.

                "NEW YORK TIMES  BESTSELLER From former  New York Times  reporter Nellie Bowles, a look at how some of the most educated people in America lost their minds\u2014and how she almost did, too.  As a Hillary voter, a  New York Times  reporter,\u00a0and frequent attendee at her local gay bars,\u00a0Nellie Bowles fit right in with her San Francisco\u00a0 neighbors and friends\u2014until she started questioning\u00a0 whether the progressive movement she knew and loved was actually helping people. When her colleagues suggested that asking such questions meant she was \u201con the wrong side of history,\u201d Bowles did what any reporter worth her salt would do: she started investigating for herself. The answers she found were stranger\u2014and funnier\u2014than she expected. In  Morning After the Revolution , Bowles gives readers a front-row seat to the absurd drama of a political movement gone mad. With irreverent accounts of attending a multiday course on \u201cThe Toxic Trends of Whiteness,\u201d following the social justice activists who run \u201cAbolitionist Entertainment LLC,\u201d and trying to please the  New York Times\u2019s  \u201cdisinformation czar,\u201d she deftly exposes the more comic excesses of a movement that went from a sideshow to the very center of American life. Deliciously funny and painfully insightful,  Morning After the Revolution  is a moment of collective psychosis preserved in amber. This is an unmissable debut by one of America\u2019s sharpest journalists. "

                "This program features an introduction, afterword, and acknowledgements read by the author.  The go-to book on immigration: fact-based, comprehensive, and nonpartisan.   Immigration is one of the most controversial topics in the United States and everywhere else. Pundits, politicians, and the public usually depict immigrants as either villains or victims. The villain narrative is that immigrants pose a threat\u2014to our economy because they steal our jobs; our way of life because they change our culture; and to our safety and laws because of their criminality. The victim argument tells us that immigrants are needy outsiders\u2014the poor, huddled masses whom we must help at our own cost if necessary. But the data clearly debunks both narratives. From jobs, investment, and innovation to cultural vitality and national security, more immigration has an overwhelmingly positive impact on everything that makes a society successful. In  The Truth About Immigration , Wharton professor Zeke Hernandez draws from nearly 20 years of research to answer all the big questions about immigration. He combines moving personal stories with rigorous research to offer an accessible, apolitical, and evidence-based look at how newcomers affect our local communities and our nation. You'll learn about the overlooked impact of immigrants on investment and job creation; realize how much we take for granted the novel technologies, products, and businesses newcomers create; get the facts straight about perennial concerns like jobs, crime, and undocumented immigrants; and gain new perspectives on misunderstood issues such as the border, taxes, and assimilation. Most books making a case for immigration tell you that immigration is good for immigrants. This book is all about how newcomers benefit you, your community, and your country. Skeptics fear that newcomers compete economically with locals because of their similarities and fail to socially assimilate because of their differences. You'll see that it's exactly the opposite: newcomers bring enduring economic benefits because of their differences and contribute positively to society because of their similarities. Destined to become the go-to book on one of the most important issues of our time, this book turns fear into hope by proving a simple truth: immigrants are essential for economically prosperous and socially vibrant nations.

                "Based on over a decade of research, a powerful, moving work of narrative nonfiction that illuminates the little-known world of the anexos of Mexico City, the informal addiction treatment centers where mothers send their children to escape the violence of the drug war.   The Way That Leads Among the Lost  reveals a hidden place where care and violence are impossible to separate: the anexos of Mexico City. The prizewinning anthropologist Angela Garcia takes us deep into the world of these small rooms, informal treatment centers for alcoholism, addiction, and mental illness, spread across Mexico City's tenements and reaching into the United States. Run and inhabited by Mexico's most marginalized populations, they are controversial for their illegality and their use of coercion. Yet for many Mexican families desperate to keep their loved ones safe, these rooms offer something of a refuge from what lies beyond them\u2014the intensifying violence surrounding the drug war. This is the first book ever written on the anexos. Garcia, who spent a decade conducting anthropological fieldwork in Mexico City, draws readers into their many dimensions, casting light on the mothers and their children who are entangled in this hidden world. Following the stories of its denizens, she asks what these places are, why they exist, and what they reflect about Mexico and the wider world. With extraordinary empathy and a sharp eye for detail, Garcia attends to the lives that the anexos both sustain and erode, wrestling with the question of why mothers turn to them as a site of refuge even as they reproduce violence. Woven into these portraits is Garcia's own powerful story of family, childhood, homelessness, and drugs\u2014a blend of ethnography and memoir converging on a set of fundamental questions about the many forms and meanings that violence, love, care, family, and hope may take. Infused with profound ethnographic richness and moral urgency,  The Way That Leads Among the Lost  is a stunning work of narrative nonfiction, a book that will leave a deep mark on readers.

No one has, not in many, many years. They used to be everywhere. You couldn't walk out of your front door in New York City in the 1930s without seeing dozens of those little guys scurrying around. Today, there are millions of grown up pigeons in New York, but not a baby pigeon to be seen. That's because they come out of the factory as adults. This is one of the many smoking guns of the bird drone surveillance crisis. Since 1959, the Deep State has mercilessly slaughtered over 12 billion birds and replaced them with identical drones that are designed to spy on private citizens and report their every action directly to the government. From pet canaries to  Sesame Street , the shadowy figures that pull the strings have infiltrated every aspect of our society, making a mockery of civil liberties while the American people live in blissful ignorance. Until now. In  Birds Aren't Real , whistleblowers Peter McIndoe and Connor Gaydos trace the roots of a political conspiracy so vast and well-hidden that it almost seems like an elaborate hoax. These hero Bird Truthers have risked life and limb to compile and disseminate a treasure trove of information about the origins of the surveillance crisis, its spread, and the patriots who are on the front lines today, raising awareness and working to reclaim America as the land of the free. This urgent manifesto features a host of useful illustrations, activities, and leaked classified documents that will convince even the most outspoken skeptic that birds aren't real.

Despite invasion by a series of British, Spanish and Napoleonic armies, their twelve-year struggle led to the creation of Haiti, the first independent black republic outside Africa. Only three years later, the British and Americans ended the Atlantic slave trade. In this outstanding example of vivid, committed and empathetic historical analysis, C. L. R. James illuminates these epoch-making events. He explores the appalling economic realities of the Caribbean economy, the roots of the world's only successful slave revolt and the utterly extraordinary former slave - Toussaint L'Ouverture - who led them. Explicitly written as part of the fight to end colonialism in Africa,  The Black Jacobins  put the slaves themselves centre stage, boldly forging their own destiny against nearly impossible odds. It remains one of the essential texts for understanding the Caribbean - and the region's inextricable links with Europe, Africa and the Americas. \u00a9 C. L. R. James 2001 (P) Penguin Audio 2022. "

The Need to Be Whole continues the work he began in The Hidden Wound (1970) and The Unsettling of America (1977), demanding a careful exploration of this hard, shared truth: The wealth of the mighty few governing this nation has been built on the unpaid labor of others. Without historical understanding of this practice of dispossession\u2014the displacement of Native peoples, the destruction of both the land and land-based communities, ongoing racial division\u2014we are doomed to continue industrialism's assault on both the natural world and every sacred American ideal. Berry writes, \"To deal with so great a problem, the best idea may not be to go ahead in our present state of unhealth to more disease and more product development. It may be that our proper first resort should be to history: to see if the truth we need to pursue might be behind us where we have ceased to look.\" If there is hope for us, this is it: that we honestly face our past and move into a future guided by the natural laws of affection. This book furthers Mr. Berry's part in what is surely our country's most vital conversation. "

                "This real-life Western tells the story of how citizens in a small Arizona border town stood up to anti-immigrant militias and vigilantes. The Marauders uncovers the riveting nonfiction saga of far-right militias terrorizing the border towns of southern Arizona. In one of the towns profiled, Arivaca, rogue militia members killed a man and his nine-year-old daughter in 2009. In response, the residents organized and spent two years trying to push the new militias out through boycotts and by urging local businesses to ban them. The militias and vigilante groups again raised the stakes, spreading Pizzagate-style conspiracy theories alleging that town residents were complicit in child sex trafficking, prompting fears of vigilante violence. The Marauders flips the standard formula most often applied to stories about immigration and the far right. Too often those stories are told from the perspective of the ones committing the violence. While Strickland doesn't shy away from exploring those dark themes, the far right are not the protagonists of the book. Rather, the people targeted by hate groups, and the individuals who rose up to stop them in their tracks, are the heroes of this dramatic story. "

From the time of the ancient Greeks onwards the West's relationship with Asia consisted for the most part in outrageous tales of monsters and giants, of silk and spices trans-shipped over vast distances and an uneasy sense of unknowable empires fantastically far away. By the 20th century much of Asia may have come under Western rule after centuries of warfare, but its intellectual, artistic and spiritual influence was fighting back.  The Light of Asia  is a wonderfully varied and entertaining history of this vexed, confused but centrally important relationship. From Marco Polo onwards Asia has been both a source of genuine fascination and equally genuine failures of comprehension. China, India and Japan were all acknowledged to be both great civilizations  and  in crude ways superseded by the West. Christopher Harding's captivating gallery of geniuses, adventurers and con-men celebrates Asia's impact on the West in all its variety. \u00a92024 Christopher Harding (P)2024 Penguin Audio. "

                "In The Invented State, Emily Thorson argues that a problematic and understudied aspect of political misinformation reflects widespread public misperception about what the government does. Because much of public policy is invisible to the public, there is fertile ground for false beliefs to flourish, leading to what Thorson terms the \"invented state\": systematic misperceptions about public policy. However, people get the facts wrong not because they are stupid or blinded by partisan loyalty. Misperceptions are created when three conditions are met: when citizens have incomplete information about an issue, when their own biases color their understanding of it, and when they feel that the issue is important. The invented state is created by exposure to misinformation and by individuals' cognitive errors. Correcting these policy misperceptions is highly effective at reducing false beliefs. Providing people with corrective information has downstream effects on attitudes. When they learn how policies really work, their approval increases and they also shift their policy priorities. Contrary to pundits' assumptions of a public who is largely indifferent to policy, there is a deep public desire to learn basic facts about how the government works. Thorson meets that desire with analysis on how the media can identify and correct substantive policy misperceptions. "

                "In Get Off My Neck, Debbie Hines draws on her unique perspective as a trial lawyer, former Baltimore prosecutor, and assistant attorney general for the State of Maryland to argue that US prosecutors, as the most powerful players in the criminal justice system, systematically target and criminalize Black people. Hines describes her disillusionment as a young Black woman who initially entered the profession with the goal of helping victims of crimes, only to discover herself aiding and abetting a system that prizes plea bargaining, speedy conviction, and excessive punishment above all else. In this book, she offers concrete, specific, and hopeful solutions for just how we can come together in a common purpose for criminal justice and racial justice reform. Get Off My Neck explains that the racial inequities in the prosecutorial system are built into our country's DNA. What's more, they are the direct result of a history that has conditioned Americans to perceive the Black body as insignificant at best and dangerous at worst. Unlike other books that discuss the prosecutor's office and change from inside the office, Hines offers a proactive approach to fixing our broken prosecutorial system through a broad-based alliance of reform-minded prosecutors, activists, allies, communities, and racial justice organizations\u2014all working together to end the racist treatment of Black people. Told intimately through personal, family, and client narratives, Get Off My Neck is not only a deeply sobering account of our criminal justice system and its devastating impact on Black children, youth, and adults but also a practical and inspiring roadmap for how we can start doing better right now. \"Years as a prosecutor taught Debbie Hines that justice in America isn't colorblind\u2014it's color coded. In Get Off My Neck, Hines not only exposes the staggering racial inequities in our prosecutorial system and the harsh history that produced it, she lights a brilliant path toa more just and equitable future.\"\u2014Marc H.

                "If we hope to share our planet successfully with one another and the AI systems we are creating, we must reflect on who we are, how we got here, and where we are heading. The Importance of Being Educable puts forward a provocative new exploration of the extraordinary facility of humans to absorb and apply knowledge. The remarkable \"educability\" of the human brain can be understood as an information processing ability. It sets our species apart, enables the civilization we have, and gives us the power and potential to set our planet on a steady course. While we can readily absorb systems of thought about worlds of experience beyond our own, we struggle to judge correctly what information we should trust. In this visionary book, Leslie Valiant argues that understanding the nature of our own educability is crucial to safeguarding our future. After breaking down how we process information to learn and apply knowledge, and drawing comparisons with other animals and AI systems, he explains why education should be humankind's central preoccupation. Will the unique capability that has been so foundational to our achievements and civilization continue to drive our progress, or will we fall victim to our vulnerabilities? If we want to protect our collective future, we must better understand and prioritize the importance of being educable. "

                "A gently powerful memoir about deepening your relationship with your homeland. For the first time in more than twenty-five years, Greg Sarris-whose novels are esteemed alongside those of Louise Erdrich and Stephen Graham Jones-presents a book about his own life. In Becoming Story he asks: What does it mean to be truly connected to the place you call home-to walk where innumerable generations of your ancestors have walked? And what does it mean when you dedicate your life to making that connection even deeper? Moving between his childhood and the present day, Sarris creates a kaleidoscopic narrative about the forces that shaped his early years and his eventual work as a tribal leader. He considers the deep past, historical traumas, and possible futures of his homeland. His acclaimed storytelling skills are in top form here, and he charts his journey in prose that is humorous, searching, and profound. Described as \"jewellike\" by the San Francisco Chronicle, Becoming Story is also a gently powerful guide in the art of belonging to the place where you live. "

                "\"A fast-paced, compelling narrative that goes far beyond the headlines.\" -KEVIN DONOVAN, author of The Billionaire Murders For Joey Philion, surviving the fire was only the beginning. On the morning of March 10th, 1988, in Orillia, Ontario, a house fire engulfed fourteen-year-old Joey Philion in flames. He suffered third degree burns on ninety-five percent of his body. Doctors didn't think he would make it through the night. After the Flames is about one of the world's most famous burn victims: his incredible survival, his nightmarish path to recovery that helped revolutionize medical treatment for burn victims worldwide, the fame thrust upon him after he was declared a hero from the media, and the tumultuous years that followed, most of which were spent under the microscope of an unforgiving public eye. The story also follows Joey's family, including his mother Linda, stepfather Mike, and younger brother Danny, all of whom endured their own tremendous hardships in the wake of a fire that changed their lives forever.

                "The New York Times bestselling author of My Vanishing Country examines the modern political landscape and policies that are impacting Black families and communities and offers solutions for a better tomorrow.    In late May in 2020, while discussing the murder of George Floyd on CNN, Bakari Sellers spoke from the heart sharing devastating insight that touched millions around the world: \"It's just so much pain. You get so tired. We have black children. I have a 15-year-old daughter. I mean, what do I tell her? I'm raising a son. I have no idea what to tell him. It's just\u2014it's hard being black in this country when your life is not valued and people are worried about the protesters and the looters. And it's just people who are frustrated for far too long and not have their voices heard.\"  In this powerful and persuasive book, Sellers expands on the issues he addressed in his New York Times bestseller My Vanishing Country, examining national politics and policies that deeply impact not only Black people in his home state of South Carolina but the lives of millions of African Americans in communities across the nation. Four years later, Sellers has an answer to the question he raised on CNN, offering much-needed prescriptions to help all Black American lives.  Sellers explores inequities in healthcare, education, early childhood education, and policing, drawing on interviews with numerous thought leaders such as pioneering voting rights and poverty activist the Rev. William Barber, and Ben Crump, the civil rights legend who successfully uses the law to achieve justice for people of color in racially charged cases. He also shares his thoughts on conservative media and the forces and dark money behind firebrands such as Tucker Carlson. This thoughtful and practical work is a timely meditation on the state of our world today and how we can all play a part in making it better for tomorrow. "

Through personal reflective essays for and about her daughter, OiYan Poon looks at how the debate over affirmative action reveals the divergent ways Asian Americans conceive of their identity. With moving sincerity and insightful study, Poon combines extensive research with personal narratives from both herself and a diverse swath of individuals across the Asian American community to reflect on and respond to her daughter\u2019s central question: What does it mean to be Asian American? Poon conducts interviews with Asian Americans throughout the US who have been actively engaged in policy debates over race-conscious admissions or affirmative action. Through these exchanges, she finds that Asian American identity remains deeply unsettled in a contest between those invested in reaching the top of the racial hierarchy alongside whiteness and those working toward a vision of justice and humanity co-constructed through cross-racial solidarity. Poon uses these contrasting viewpoints to guide her conversations with her daughter, providing a heartfelt and optimistic look at how understanding the diversity and nuances of the Asian American experience can help us envision a more equitable future.

Over the last half a billion years, there have been five mass extinctions, when the diversity of life on earth suddenly and dramatically contracted. Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.    The Sixth Extinction  draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines\u2013geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, and marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. Elizabeth Kolbert, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and  New Yorker  writer, accompanies many of these researchers into the field, and introduces you to a dozen species\u2013some already gone, others facing extinction\u2013that are being affected by the sixth extinction.   Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. "

                "Thirty years have passed since Cornel West's book Race Matters rose to the top of the bestseller lists in 1993. Yet his book remains as relevant as ever to American culture-even more so, if one considers its influence on contemporary racial justice movements such as Black Lives Matter, prison justice, and the fight for police reform. Prophetic Leadership and Visionary Hope looks back to the original 1993 text and forward into the future of racial understanding and healing in our current century. Prophetic Leadership and Visionary Hope offers new points of entry into the thorny issues that the 1993 text addressed: the challenge of leadership in a culture marked by the legacy of white supremacy; the limited value of liberal affirmative action programs in promoting the affirmation of Black humanity; the dangerous seductions of African American conservatism and the question of Black self-regard; the necessity and difficulty of cross-race solidarity and cross-religious affinity; the need to channel legitimate Black rage over untenable conditions of existence into productive opportunities and viewpoints. With essays that span the topics of history, politics, philosophy, religion, cultural studies, music, and aesthetics, Prophetic Leadership and Visionary Hope is as wide-ranging as the thinker whose ideas it engages, interrogates, and celebrates.

From the outside, Rumana seemed an unlikely victim of domestic abuse: married to a man of her own choosing and progressing in her career as a professor of international relations at Dhaka University. But in 2011, on return from graduate studies at the University of British Columbia, her husband attacked and blinded her in front of their young daughter. As Rumana's horrifying story garnered international headlines, and connections brought her to Vancouver in an attempt\u2014ultimately futile\u2014to restore her sight, her plight underscored the fact that there are no typical victims of intimate-partner violence. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Denise Chong goes behind the headlines to reveal the devolution of a love story into a tale of tyranny behind closed doors, and the pursuit of justice that proved all the more elusive during the rise of social media.  Out of Darkness  tells a globe-spanning narrative of loyalty, perseverance and a woman\u2019s determination to face the future and rebuild a life with meaning. "

                "A rare study that transforms our understanding of why youth die by suicide, why youth suicide clusters happen, and how to stop them In Life under Pressure, Anna S. Mueller and Seth Abrutyn investigate the social roots of youth suicide and why certain places weather disproportionate incidents of adolescent suicides and suicide clusters. Through close examination of kids' lives in a community repeatedly rocked by youth suicide clusters, Mueller and Abrutyn reveal how the social worlds that youth inhabit and the various messages they learn in those spaces-about who they are supposed to be, mental illness, and help-seeking-shape their feelings about themselves and in turn their risk of suicide. With great empathy, Mueller and Abrutyn also identify the moments when adults unintentionally fail kids by not talking to them about suicide, teaching them how to seek help, or helping them grieve. Through stories of survival, resilience, and even rebellion, Mueller and Abrutyn show how social environments can cause suicide and how they can be changed to help kids discover a life worth living. By revealing what it is like to live and die in one community, Life under Pressure offers tangible solutions to one of the twenty-first century's most tragic public health problems. "

                "Australia's leading social psychologist examines our society today and asks timely and urgent questions about its future Life is messy. Relationships are complex. Outcomes are uncertain. Yet none of our differences-whether based on ethnicity, politics, religion, cultural tastes and preferences, or gender-are nearly as significant as the humanity we share. Amidst our epidemics of loneliness, anxiety and depression, and the impacts of entrenched poverty and ubiquitous technology, The Way We Are examines the major trends that are shaking the foundations of the Australian way of life. Drawing on thousands of interviews over a lifetime of research, Hugh Mackay, much loved and highly respected social psychologist, presents a compelling portrait of Australia today. He celebrates the march towards gender equality and explains the stubborn persistence of misogyny, the anti-social consequences of social media, the complex legacy of the Baby Boomers, and the 'fake wisdom' that guides too much of our thinking. Exploring the steady decline in religious faith and practice, Hugh identifies the many gods we continue to worship, and points to the positive role that dreaming can play in our lives. Though some of his observations may not be easy reading, Hugh's analysis is suffused with affection for our country. Inspiring, provocative and powerfully argued, The Way We Are is the most important-and uplifting-book you'll read all year. It will encourage you to reflect deeply on the question: What kind of society do we want to become? 'Hugh Mackay is one of this country's most perceptive social commentators.' - Sydney Morning Herald 'Mackay is something of a national treasure.' - Canberra Times. "
